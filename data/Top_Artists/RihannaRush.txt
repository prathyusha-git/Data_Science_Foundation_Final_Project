The galdem rush to feel the ill touch
Galdem ball and gal them a scream
They think ita love but a lust
Thats why a bad gal beside is a must for I bust
She's the angel of me conscious yo yo yo
Never thought that I could feel somethin' so strong
I wanna hold on to this moment before its gone
I wanna hold your body close its callin' to me
And when I look into your eyes I'm likin' what I see
Boy don't hold back from me
Just give me everything you got
I wonder I can keep
I know your gonna keep it hot
I catch a rush boy whenever we touch I go crazy
I'm feelin' you baby
I dream like this boy whenever we kiss I can't take it
You know I can't fake it
(Yo yo yo)
Well I'm back with the boys and I knowin' that
Don't watch my face my gal you know I'm coming back
Most of mea gal them slide off easy like a thunderclap
When I see you from the back you know me need all a dat yo yo yo
Don't even know you name
But this feels so right
Its like I known you boy for all of my life
Don't need to say a word
We both understand
And my eyes are telling you
Catch me if you can
I'm fallin' faster now
You know you got me where you want
Too late I can't slow down
No way we're ever gonna stop
I catch a rush boy whenever we touch I go crazy (I go crazy)
I'm feeling you baby (feeling you baby)
I dream like this boy whenever we kiss I can't take it
You know I can't fake it
(No I can't take it)
(No I can't take it)
(No no)
My girl turn it around and cut it out
And come a little close so you feel what I'm 'bout here
(No I can't take it)
(No I can't take it)
(No no)
My girl turn it around bring it near
Let me show you a thing dat a done ya career
I'm fallin' faster now
You know you got me where you want
Too late I can't slow down
No way we're ever gonna stop
I catch a rush boy whenever we touch I go crazy
I'm feelin' you baby
I dream like this boy whenever we kiss I can't take it
You know I can't fake it
I catch a rush boy whenever we touch I go crazy
I'm feeling you baby
