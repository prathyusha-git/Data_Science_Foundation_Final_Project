I wish you the best for the rest of your life
Felt sorry for you when I looked in your eyes
But I need to confess, I told you a lie
I said you
You were the love of my life
The love of my life
Did I break your heart?
Did I waste your time?
I tried to be there for you
Then you tried to break mine
It isn't asking for a lot for an apology
For making me feel like it'd kill you if I tried to leave
You said you'd never fall in love again because of me
Then you moved on immediately (bum, bum, bum)
But I wish you the best for the rest of your life (rest of your life)
Felt sorry for you when I looked in your eyes
But I need to confess (confess), I told you a lie (I told you a lie)
When I said you (I said you)
You were the love of my life
The love of my life
So you found her, now go fall in love
Just like we were, if I ever was
It's not my fault, I did what I could
You made it so hard, like I knew you would
Thought I was depressed or losing my mind
My stomach upset almost all of the time
But after I left, it was obvious why (ooh), mm
Because for you, you
I was the love of your life, mm
But you were not mine (but you were not mine)
It isn't asking for a lot for an apology
For making me feel like it'd kill you if I tried to leave
You said you'd never fall in love again because of me
Then you moved on, then you moved on
Then you moved on, then you moved on
Then you moved on, then you moved on

Ooh
You wanted to keep it
Like something you found
'Til you didn't need it
But you should've seen it
The way it went down
Wouldn't believe it
Wanna know what I told her
With her hand on my shoulder?
You were so mediocre
And we're so glad it's over now
It's over now
It's over now
It's over now
Camera, caught on camera
The girl's on camera
Your girl's a fan of-
Miss me, say you miss me
It's such a pity
We're both so pretty
