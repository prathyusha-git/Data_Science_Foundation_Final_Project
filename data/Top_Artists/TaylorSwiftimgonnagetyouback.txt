Lilac short skirt
The one that fits me like skin
Did your research
you knew the price going in
And I'll tell you one thing
Honey, I can tell when somebody still wants me, come clean
Standing at the bar like something's funny
Bubbly
Once you fix your face
I'm going in
Whether I'm gonna be your wife or
Gonna smash up your bike
I haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back
Whether I'm gonna curse you out or
Take you back to my house
I haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back
I hear the whispers in your eyes
I'll make you wanna think twice,
You'll find
That you were never not mine
You're mine
Small talk, big love
Act like I don't care what you did
I'm an Aston Martin that you steered straight into the ditch
then ran and hid
And I'll tell you one thing, honey, I could take the upper hand and
touch your body
Flip the script and leave you like a dumb house party
Or I might just love you til the end
Whether I'm gonna be your wife or
Gonna smash up your bike
I haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back
Whether I'm gonna flip you off or
Pull you into the closet
I haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back
I hear the whispers in your eyes
I'll make you wanna think twice,
You'll find
That you were never not mine
You're mine
I could feel it coming
Humming in the way you move
Push the reset button
We're becoming something new
Say you got somebody I'll say I got someone too
Even if it's handcuffed I'm leaving here with you
Bygones will be bygone eras
Fading into gray
We broke all the pieces, but still want to play the game
I told my friends I hate you but I love you just the same
Pick your poison, babe
I'm poison either way
Whether I'm gonna be your wife or
Gonna smash up your bike
I haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back
Whether I'm gonna curse you out or
Take you back to my house
I haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back
I hear the whispers in your eyes
I'll make you wanna think twice,
You'll find
That you were never not mine
I'm gonna get you back
