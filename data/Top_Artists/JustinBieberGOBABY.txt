That's my baby
She's iconic
iPhone case
Lip gloss on it
And oh, my days
She keeps 'em takin'
It's comedy just block it out my baby
When sunlight turns to shadows
And its gets hard to face
Like water to a flower
Babe I know you need the rain
Nothing needs to work out
And nothing needs to break
You don't need to pretend that you're ok
So cry on my shoulder
Just turn into me
Cry on my shoulder
Whenever you need it
You better believe I can hold all the weight
That you feel inside
So cry on my shoulder
That lone melody
Cry on my shoulder
I know your heart breaks but
Lay it all down and I can love it away
Just stay by my side
So go baby go baby go baby go
♪
Said go baby go baby go baby go

Sunday to Sunday
I'm here when you're weak
Closer beside me
Is always ok
Every moment
You know where to find me
You don't have speak
I can read you
When sunlight turns to shadows
And its gets hard to face
Like water to a flower
Babe I know you need the rain
Nothing needs to work out
Nothing needs to break
Don't need to pretend that you're ok
So cry on my shoulder
Just turn into me
Cry on my shoulder
Whenever you need it
You better believe I can hold all the weight
That you feel inside
So cry on my shoulder
That lone melody
Cry on my shoulder
I know your heart breaks but
Lay it all down and I can love it away
Just stay by my side
