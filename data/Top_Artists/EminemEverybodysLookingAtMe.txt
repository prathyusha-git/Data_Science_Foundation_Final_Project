Everybody's looking at me
Everybody is looking at me
Everybody's looking at me
Everybody is looking at me
Everybody's looking at me (shit is so crazy)
Everybody is looking at me (it's like)
Everybody's looking at me (everywhere I go, I'm in the spotlight)
Everybody is looking at me (from the moment I wake up, it's)
Lights, action, cameras flashing' (shh)
Managers, sponsors, concerts, monster mashin' (yeah)
Moshin', everyone thrashin' (uh)
Laughin', lashin' in arrogant fashion
Type who might throw his underwear in the trash and
Wipe his ass with the American flag like Marilyn Manson
Updated Axl Rose
White version of Shaft, pimp slappin' hoes (psh)
Pull up like a Mac, jеt black limos
Stretch so far back, can't see the back windows
Steppin' out, pink hats, furs, and minks
Bitch on each arm, what the fuck you think? Shit
Right arm got that kid from NSYNC's bitch on it (Britney)
Left arm got that little pink chick on it
Me and Dre, at VMA's again
Pissin' off these lesbians and gays again, it's rainin' men
Strut as we walk the carpet
Stop under the tarp and talk to Carson (what up?)
BJ's pleadin' with us not to start shit (please, please)
Not to stomp the shit out of chocolate starfish (no)
Pose for the snapshots, paparazzi (ch-ch)
Everybody's eyes are watchin'
Just tryin' to guess what I'ma do next, waitin' to see
I just walk in, sit down, and take my seat, it's like
What the hell are you looking at? (I always feel like)
What do I look like, a crook? (Somebody's watchin' me)
I'm not no criminal, I'm just a plain old guy (and I have no privacy)
So keep them opinions and walk on by (oh-oh-oh)
I said, "What the hell are you looking at?" (I always feel like)
What do I look like, a crook? (Somebody's watchin' me)
I'm not no criminal, I'm just a plain old guy (and I have no privacy)
So keep them opinions and walk on by (oh-oh-oh)
Arrested for gun possession
Have I learned my lesson? Fuck no, 'nother Smith & Wesson
Pissed off, pistol whippin', let's pick contestants
Mr Just can't use his fist for weapons lookin' around for some next shit to step in
Twisted rep, y'all got a misconception
I wonder would I be misunderstood if I wasn't from the hood, I was from some good
Uppity-dumb suburb in some upscale community?
I guess you can see what trailers do to me
Grow up, not give a fuck, fail in school and be cool as me
Scream, "Fuck sluts, jail, and jewelry"
I never would've dreamed women ever would've screamed
My name louder than when she's arguing with me
It's hard for me to be humble and still have it in me
To rumble with anybody who wants to
I must prove I'm no punk, he's punched through
It's for uncle, I know you're watchin'
And I'm much too much pride to show you that I'm hurtin' inside
I'll never let my guard down, this curtain is wide open and I
What the hell are you looking at? (I always feel like)
What do I look like, a crook? (Somebody's watchin' me)
I'm not no criminal, I'm just a plain old guy (and I have no privacy)

My private life is springer, five times a night
See it via satellite, live right on site and hold on tight
Shit, fuck the Tyson fight, you might see - try suicide tonight
See, I'm done fucked up and told so much
It's probably the only reason I sold so much
'Cause y'all know so much, what's left to do?
But try to keep my pointy-ass nose out of the news
'Cause news flashes travel faster than lightning rods
Oh God, he's on stage with Elton John
He's got a motherfucking pink GLAAD t-shirt on
Huggin' a homosexual, flippin' the cameras off
But at the Grammys, thought Slim hated the Grammys
No, I said, "You think I give a damn about a Grammy?"
You never answered me, now had you have asked me
I'd told you exactly why I wasn't here last year
See, there's nominees for the best album
Rap's got a separate category, now how come?
What are we, peons? Fuck Celine Dion
Pee on your corny award show you want me on
But guess what? That means you win
I can't give in and let y'all beat me again
Plus, this year, my record's almost diamond
I'm in the same category as Paul Simon
Ain't no other rap in the category I'm in
But they're callin' me to the stage, tellin' me I win
So just as I go to approach the podium
The crowd's goin' nuts like they're about to explode or somethin'
Expecting me to give some acceptance speech
That's gonna knock each motherfucker out of their seats
But the truth is I ain't have shit to say
Except, thanks, but you should've gave this shit to Dre
So what the hell are you looking at? (I always feel like)
What do I look like, a crook? (Somebody's watching' me)
I'm not no criminal, I'm just a plain old guy (and I have no privacy)
So keep them opinions and walk on by (oh-oh-oh)
