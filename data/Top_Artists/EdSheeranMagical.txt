One touch, electric shock
Eyes locked, like, did you feel that too?
World stops, just us here under dots
In the darkness of the blue, out of the blue
Is this how it feels to be in love?
This is magical, this is magical
Is this how it feels to be in love?
This is magical, this is magical
♪
Our lips barely one inch
Your skin brushed by my fingertips
Morning's white mist, so delicate
Covers as we begin, as we begin
Is this how it feels to be in love?
This is magical, this is magical
Is this how it feels to be in love?
This is magical, this is magical
♪
Silence is filled as time stands still
Our thoughts in the open room
Lay here until the sun distils its light
For the perfect view, now I'm with you
Is this how it feels to be in love?
This is magical, this is magical
Is this how it feels to be in love?
This is magical, this is magical
