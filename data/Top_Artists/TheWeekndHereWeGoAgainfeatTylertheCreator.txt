Strike a pose with my kinfolk
Front page of the billboards
Suit and tie, and cigar smokes
Macallan shots 'til it burn throats
We still celebrating Superbowl
Catalog looking legendary
Ring froze like it's February
XO that's a mercenary
A quarter bill on an off-year
Used to sing on lofts
But now we cruising on a yacht, we clear, yeah
Said you wanted your boyfriend jealous with a couple pics
And you didn't expect to fall for me once you got this dick
The city dark, city dangerous
Your girlfriend's tryna pair you with somebody more famous
But instead you ended up with someone so basic, faceless
Someone to take your pictures and frame it
And my new girl, she a movie star
My new girl, she a movie star
I loved her right, make her scream like Neve Campbell
But when I make her laugh, swear it cures my depressing thoughts
'Cause baby girl, she a movie star
Baby girl, she a movie star
I told myself that I'd never fall
But here we go again, ooh
Ohh
Here we go again
Life's a dream
'Cause it's never what it seems
But you'd rather love and lost with tears
Than never love at all
So here we go again
Although this love is strong to me
Some things can change, go wrong with me
We don't know how it's gonna be
Forever is too long to me
We don't need the government involved because we like to touch
We don't need no damn religion telling us that we in love
But if we did crush down the road, spending lawyer fees up
Pen and pad gone save my ass if these feelings freeze up
You gone sign this prenup, you gon' sign this prenup
You gone sign this prenup, you gon' sign this prenup
Ohhh
Here we go again
Life's a dream
'Cause it's never what it seems
But you'd rather love and lost with tears
Than never love at all
So here we go again
