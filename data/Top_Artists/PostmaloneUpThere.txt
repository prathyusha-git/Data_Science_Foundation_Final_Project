Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
When I took a ride in the dead of night
Told myself that everything was okay
Try to understand how you standin' over me
Girl, it's drivin' me crazy
Yeah, it's freezin' fuckin' cold in the dead of night
The only heat, it come from the ashtray
I might as well get high as hell and just keep actin' like
Everything doesn't phase me
Yeah, take me all the way to the top, baby
Don't even if I tell you to stop, baby
Take me all the way to the sky, baby, baby
I wanna go up there
And I don't ever wanna come down
I wanna see what's up there
Actin' like I got it all figured out
I wanna go up there
And I don't ever wanna come down
I wanna see what's up there
Must be better than the hell on the ground
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It's freezin' fuckin' cold in the dead of night
And I'ma drop the top with no Rogaine (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
And now might sound irrelevant but I prefer to stack my chips
When everything fallin' (backwoods)
And I ain't religious but I look into the sky
And pray to anyone holy
I been drinkin' way too much and man I got the blues
Because my baby don't hold me
Yeah, take me all the way to the top, baby
Don't even if I tell you to stop, baby
Take me all the way to the sky, baby, baby
I wanna go up there
And I don't ever wanna come down
I wanna see what's up there
Actin' like I got it all figured out
I wanna go up there
And I don't ever wanna come down
I wanna see what's up there
Must be better than the hell on the ground
I wanna go up there
And I don't ever wanna come down
I wanna see what's up there
Actin' like I got it all figured out
I wanna go up there
And I don't ever wanna come down
I wanna see what's up there
Must be better than the hell on the ground
