This ain't cheddar, this quiche
Got a bitch to ride or die, ride it just like it's on my bike (whoa, whoa)
Do this all to circulate, fuck her, just feels like you're like
Do it just to rock her life, take it just to rock her life (whoa, whoa)
Call her just to rock her life, ride it just like I ride my bike
Take her on a field trip, take her on a ride (schyeah)
Take her on a trip (schyeah), take her out her house
Uh, I'm spittin' out venom
The baby not real, it's not in 'em
Send 'em a letter, I kill 'em
Close that boy door, we dismissed him
I done got too high, just a little
And I'm out my mind, just a little
Red Lambo', red Skittles
Double O-5, we criminal
Ain't bought a yacht, bought a missile
Tape on the gun, can't miss 'em
Tape on it, shake on it, shake on it
Uh, shawty keep fuckin' my bones
Movin' too fast, 'bout to break somethin'
Shawty keep hidin' my phone
You keep doin' that, I'ma break somethin'
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, break somethin'
Got a bitch to ride or die, ride it just like it's on my bike (whoa, whoa)
Do this all to circulate (hold up), fuck her, just feels like you're like (hold up)
Do it just to rock her life (hold up, hold up), take it just to rock her life (hold up, hold up)
Call her just to rock her life (hold up), ride it just like I ride my bike (hold up, uh-uh)
Take her on a field trip (uh-uh), take her on a ride (uh-uh, schyeah)
Take her on a trip (uh-uh), take her out her house (huh)
Whippin' that Benz like a rental
200 cash, my bitch say I'm mental
Medical plans, I'm all in her dental
We like a dog, I'm fresh out the kennel
Niggas say, "Gas," they rollin' up fennel
Ain't on my level, lil' bitch, don't reach
Always hollerin' 'bout you rich, we riche
This ain't no regular cheddar, this quiche
You ain't outside, I wish it was different (uh-uh, uh-uh)
You ain't outside, I wish it was different (uh-uh, uh-uh)
I'm draggin' my nuts, got my dick out in the dirt
Put it right in her butt, got her twerkin' in Turks
That my lil' bitch, she gon' listen to Durk
In the trenches with her feelin' uncomfortable
I was crushin' on you, now I'm fuckin' on you
Steady bussin' on you, now you love me
Haters gon' say you can just want my lil' paper
But who wouldn't want a nigga with some money?
Dick in her stomach, I'm makin' her vomit
That foreign imported from Saudi Arabia
Like how you riding the dick like a gangster
For Yeezy, you can turn my dealer to an angel
My name just shoulda been Ty
'Cause dollar signs get my dick wet
Got my bitch high as shit, she out of her mind
Bae on the trip, I done took her to Six Flags
Got a bitch to ride or die, ride it just like it's on my bike (whoa, whoa)
Do this all to circulate, fuck her, just feels like you're like (Carti)
Do it just to rock her life, take it just to rock her life (whoa, whoa, Carti)
Call her just to rock her life, ride it just like I ride my bike
Take her on a field trip, take her on a ride (schyeah)
Take her on a trip (Carti), take her out her house
