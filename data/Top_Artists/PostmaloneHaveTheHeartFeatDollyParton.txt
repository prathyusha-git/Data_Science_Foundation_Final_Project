Baby, I don't have the heart to break yours
Yeah, and trouble rode in on the back of a pale white horse
You're so sweet and tryna leave is like slamming a revolving door
Baby, I don't have the heart to break yours
I should be calling it quits instead of calling you up
We should be making some plans instead of making love (oh)
We're playing chicken with enough is enough
Baby, I don't have the heart to break yours
Yeah, and trouble rode in on the back of a pale white horse
You're so sweet and tryna leave is like slamming a revolving door (mm-hm)
Baby, I don't have the heart to break yours
I don't have the heart
Mm
Wanna hear something sexy?
I like the way that my bed is looking over your boots
And them bell-bottoms I wear make walking out hard to do
We know well that it ain't gonna work
Oh, what the hell's one more night gonna hurt?
Baby, I don't have the heart to break yours
Yeah, and trouble rode in on the back of a pale white horse
You're so sweet and tryna leave is like slamming a revolving door (mm-hm)
Baby, I don't have the heart to break yours (to break yours)
We should saw this love in half on a saw dust floor
Baby, I don't have the heart to break yours
Baby, I don't have the heart to break yours
I just can't do it
