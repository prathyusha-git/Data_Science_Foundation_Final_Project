Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did

Ha
Ha-ha, time for a little revenge
The story starts when it was hot, and it was summer, and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you could say, "Sabotage"
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with (oh)
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from
She's not a saint, and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
He was a moth to the flame
She was holding the matches, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge (revenge), ha

She looks at life like it's a party, and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend, and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling, and
She thinks I'm psycho, 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
They didn't teach you that in prep school, so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity (think about what you did)
She's not a saint, and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
He was a moth to the flame
She was holding the matches, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge (ha-ha)
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard?
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I'll always get the last word
Whoa
(Come on, can you take it back?)
(Come on)
She's not a saint, and she's not what you think (no)
She's an actress, whoa (you know that you deserve it)
He was a moth to the flame
She was holding the matches, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge (come on)
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do, oh (no, no, no, no)
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing? (No)
I don't think you do, I don't think you do (come on, come on)
Let's hear the applause (oh, oh)
Come show me how much better you are (feels so much better, yeah?)
See, you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say, "Sabotage"
