I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be alone
In the darkness
I don't wanna be alone
In the darkness
I don't wanna be alone
In the darkness anymore
Here I am, alone again
Can't get out of this hole I'm in
It's like the walls are closin' in
You can't help me, no one can
I can feel these curtains closin'
I go to open 'em
But something pulls 'em closed again
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
Feels like I'm loathing in Las Vegas
Haven't got the vaguest, why I'm so lost?
But I'd make you this small wager
If I bet you, I'll be in tomorrow's paper
Who would the odds favor?
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
I'm so much like my father
You would think that I knew him
I keep pacin' this room, Valium
Then chase it with booze
One little taste it'll do
Maybe I'll take and snooze
Then tear up the stage in a few
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
Fuck the Colt 45, I'ma need somethin' stronger
If I pop any caps, it better be off of vodka
Round after round after round
I'm gettin' loaded (Haha)
That's a lot of shots, huh?
Double entendre (Hello darkness, my old friend)
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness (Yeah)
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
(Hello darkness my old friend)
Now I'm starin' at the room
Service menu off a Benzo
I can hear the music
Continue to crescendo
I can see the whole venue from my window
That's when you know you're schizo (Hello darkness my old friend)
'Cause I keep peakin' out the curtain from the hotel
The music is so loud
But it's almost as though
I don't hear no sound
I should get ready for the show now
Wait, is this the whole crowd?
I thought this was sold out
(Hello darkness my old friend)
But it's only the opening act
It's early don't overreact
Then something told me, relax
And just hope for the show to be packed
Don't wanna hit the stage
Before they fill each row to the max
'Cause that'd be totally wack
You can't murder a show nobody's at (Hello darkness my old friend)
But what if nobody shows?
Panic mode, 'bout to snap and go
Mother- wacko at any second
'Bout to cancel the show
Just as fans below rush the entrance
Plan is a go to wreck-
Cameras in all directions (Hello darkness my old friend)
The press is about to go ape-
Bananas on all the networks
Commando with extra clips
I got ammo for all the hecklers
I'm armed to the teeth
Another - fall off the bed
Hit the ground and crawl to the dresser
Alcohol on my breath as I reach for the scope
I'm blackin' out I'm all out of meds
With them Benzodiazepines gone
Now it's just magazines sprawled out on the floor
Off the media
I'm goin' all out, this is war
(Hello darkness my old friend)
And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness (Yeah)
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
People start to show up
Time to start the show up
It's 10:05 p.m. and
The curtain starts to go up
And I'm already sweatin'
But I'm locked and loaded
For rapid fire spittin'
For all the concert goers
Scopes for sniper vision
Surprise from out of nowhere
As I slide the clip in
From inside the hotel
Leanin' out the window
Going Keyser Söze
Finger on the trigger
But I'm a licensed owner
With no prior convictions
So lost, the sky's the limit
So my supplies infinite
Strapped like I'm a solider
Got 'em hopping over
Walls and climbing fences
Some of them John Travolta
Staying alive by inches (Hello darkness my old friend)
Cops are knockin', oh-
Thought I blocked the entrance
Guess show time is over
No suicide note
Just a note for target distance
But if you'd like to know
The reason why I did this
You'll never find a motive
Truth is I have no idea
I am just as stumped
No signs of mental illness
Just tryin' to show ya
The reason why we're so fucked
'Cause by the time it's over
Won't make the slightest difference
(Hello darkness my old friend)
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
(Hello darkness my old friend)
