Eenie, meenie, money, mo
Catch a player by the toe
If ya want to, let him go
Ladies don't worry 'cause they got plenty more
Men be falling like the rain, so we ain't running out
Falling like the rain, so we ain't running out
Falling like the rain, so we ain't running out
Oh, it's raining men, girl, what you worry 'bout?
Who you think you getting with that "Hi, let me freak ya"
You got me mistaken thinking you gon' get it easy
First of all you need to know that I'm not the one
Think you getting something, baby, you ain't getting none
All you need to know that I'm a two times five
Load it, cock it, aim it baby, boom bye-bye
Set your standards lower, boy, you're aiming too high
Matter of fact, your friend looks better, so goodbye
Eenie, meenie, money, mo
Catch a player by the toe
If ya want to, let him go
Ladies don't worry 'cause they got plenty more
Men be falling like the rain, so we ain't running out

Excuse me but who are you fixing to be?
Let them motherfuckers know there's plenty of fish in the sea
And he sweatin' me just 'cause I got the tightest hole
Bet I couldn't find that thing with a microscope
Give me dome, dome, da-da-da-da-da-dome, dome, dome
I ain't trippin' on your money, money, long, long, long
Want my own TV production company
So tell Harpo to hit me Celie
Anyway RiRi, what rhymes with your name freely?
Money got you vacationing in Chile
Do you want to sit on the back while I wheelie, really? really?
No for real, really?
Laid down on the beach, they be feedin' me my catfishes
'Cause it's raining men
Fat bitches
Men be falling like the rain, so we ain't running out
Falling like the rain, so we ain't running out
Falling like the rain, so we ain't running out
Oh, it's raining men, girl, what you worry 'bout?
Oh, yeah, yeah, oh, whoa, whoa
Oh, yeah, yeah, oh, whoa, whoa
Oh, yeah, yeah, oh, whoa, whoa
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I said ay, outta my way, where my ladies?
Riding big, living good, doing they things
Dancing don't pay
Player keep the money I can buy my own ring
Up in the club, see me coming
Dime a dozen so it don't mean nothing to me
And I ain't even worried about you
Because there's plenty more fish in the sea, okay
Eenie, meenie, money, mo
Catch a player by the toe
If ya want to, let him go
Ladies don't worry 'cause they got plenty more
