Sending shockwaves through my system
I can't go, I'm closed for business
I can't go, I'm closed for business (ooh, yeah-yeah, yeah)
I'm closed for business
Sending, send, sending shockwaves (yeah)
Shorty can't tell me 'bout nothin' (whoo)
Always mad about somethin' (hey)
I'm on my way, I'm comin' (ooh)
Sunday to Monday, I'll be
You ain't scared, I see
Sending shockwaves through my system
I can't go, I'm closed for business
I'm closed for business
I'm closed for business
She mad, she see red (she get mad, I'm doing me)
If you gon' make your own bed (the man been California king)
And I know she know I fuckеd (all her friends that don't come around)
I wasn't goin' out likе a sucker then, I ain't goin' out like a sucker now
You want me to bring you in it
I can't, though, you bad for business
So I'm closed for business
She talkin' 'bout, "Just think about it, Ye"
My mind closed for business
Sending shockwaves through my system
I can't go, I'm closed for business
I can't go, I'm closed for business (oh, yeah-yeah, yeah)
I'm closed for business
Sending, send, sending shockwaves (yeah)
Shorty can't tell me 'bout nothin' (whoo)
Always mad about somethin' (hey)
I'm on my way, I'm comin' (ooh)
Sunday to Monday, I'll be
You ain't scared, I see
Sending shockwaves through my system
I can't go, I'm closed for business
I'm closed for business
I'm closed for business
I'm closed for business
