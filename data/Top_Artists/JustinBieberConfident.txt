Don't do it to me
Don't do it to me (oh, no, no, oh, no, no)
Don't do it to me (oh, no, no, oh, no, no)
Don't do it to me (oh, no, no, oh, no, no)
Don't do it to me (oh, no, no, oh, no, no)
Focused, I'm focused
She got a body like that, I ain't never seen nothin' like that, uh-uh
Like a fantasy in front of me, yeah
I think that something special's going down
That's right, I think she foreign (foreign)
I think she foreign (foreign), got passports
Mi amor ('mor), started slow (slow), got faster
She gon' work some more (more), work some more (more)
No stoppin' her now (now, now)
No stoppin' her now (now, now, now, now)
Then she started dancing, sexual romancin'
Nasty but she fancy, lipstick on my satin sheets
What's your nationality? I wonder if there's more of you
She's got my attention, she's confident
Oh no, no, oh, no, no, she's confident
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, and I'm down with it
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, she's confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room
She said it's her first time (oh, yeah, yeah)
I think she might have lied
Feels so good, damn (oh, yeah, yeah), and I don't know why
I'm addicted (oh, yeah, yeah), something like an addict
Got me twisted (oh, yeah, yeah)
But still I gotta have it
Explosive, explosive (yeah, yeah)
I could still smell her perfume
It's not hard to notice, that I'm open (yeah, yeah)
Hypnotized by the way she moves
Then she started dancing, sexual romancin'
Nasty but she fancy, Mona Lisa masterpiece
What's your nationality? I wonder if there's more of you
She's got my attention (oh, no), but she's confident
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, she's confident
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, and I'm down with it
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, she's confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room
She said it's her first time (oh, yeah, yeah)
I think she might have lied
Feels so good, damn (oh, yeah, yeah), and I don't know why
I'm addicted (oh, yeah, yeah), something like an addict
Got me twisted (Chance the Rapper), but still I gotta have it
Tattoos, piercings, and she just learned to twerk
She ain't got a heart or an ass, just her brains
Gotta ask 'cause her ass on a learning curve
And she love to hurn the berb, I mean burn the word
That's only legal with a doctor's note
Real deep pockets like a doctor's coat
Stay faded like Diddy, hair back tryna rock the boat
She the first mate when I rock the boat
She never forget to ride like a bicycle
She like planes, trains, chains with icicles
It goes her, blank, blank, and rock and roll
She say, "I know, honey bunny, that's the funny thing"
Thots twerk for the Goodfellas
She money dance with the money team (she's confident)
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, she's confident
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, and I'm down with it
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, she's confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room
She said it's her first time (oh, yeah, yeah)
I think she might have lied
Feels so good, damn (oh, yeah, yeah), and I don't know why
I'm addicted (oh, yeah, yeah), something like an addict
Got me twisted (oh, yeah, yeah)
But still I gotta have it
Still I gotta have it (yeah)
Still I gotta have it (alright)
Still I gotta have it (yeah, alright)
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no (yeah)
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no (alright)
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no (yeah)
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no
But still I gotta have it
