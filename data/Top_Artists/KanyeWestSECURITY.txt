Yo, Kim K and motherfuckin' Kris Jenner, man
I rebuke y'all in the name of Jesus
Allow my man Ye to raise his black children
Y'all white heathens should not be allowed to control a Black man's child
And involve them in all type of demonic debauchery to corrupt i-innocent souls
No, you can't be on my mama album
Pops home, I ain't gettin' frisked
I put your security at risk
Pops home, I ain't gettin' frisked
I put your security at risk
I put the security at risk
Okay, we gon' make this an event?
Y'all gon' need security for this
Hmm, yeah, uh
I ain't gettin' frisked
I put your security at risk
I walk in the crib, no gettin' frisked
Butt-naked in the kitchen cooking grits
Tell yo' mama, "Come give me a kiss"
Security gon' need security for this
I ain't gettin' frisked
I put your security at risk
I ain't gettin' frisked
Don't put the security at risk
Never take the family picture off the fridge
Never stand between a man and his kids
Y'all ain't got enough security for this
Y'all ain't got enough security for this
I put your security at risk
I make your security aquit
Like, "We don't get paid enough for this"
