Jet plane headed up to the sky
Spread wings in the clouds, gettin' high
We ain't hit a rave in a while
So take me back to London-don-don
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome
No town does it quite like my home
So take me back to London-don-don-don-don-don
(See if you know all these ones, here we g-)
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
My sins need holy water, feel it washin' over me
Little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Thе truth and my lies right now are falling like thе rain, so let the river run
Pour out the bottle, I want a leveller
When I'm with you, I never get enough
Slow whine, I'm not in a rush
I can hear music when you're here
Tonight, we're rollin', party 'til closin'
Since I put the ring on her finger, it's still frozen, slow motion
I wanna feel you over me, yeah
When you want see me, when you want see me
I'm in West London this evening
Givin' me the feelings, girl, I'm not leavin'
'Til I fly LA next weekend
Peru, nah, girl, I'd rather go find somewhere quiet, Peru
She ain't messin' with no other man
Me and her have something different
I really need all you to understand
Nobody's comin' close and I don't ever wanna run around
I spent my youth jumpin' in and out
But you know I fuckin' love her now
Like nobody ever could
And you know I stay trippin', am I crazy? Oh, no
I'm stickin' with my baby, for sure
Together, or solo
It doesn't matter where we are, 'cause if you cross her, then you cross me
Nobody's comin' close
And I think that you should know that if you cross her, then you cross me
So come on and let it show
And I think that you should know
L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out
We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, don't ask that question here
This is my only fear, that we become
Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes, front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes, prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party
That's not who we are (we are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful
Oh, that's not who we are (we are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful, hey, hey
She got the brown eyes, caramel thighs, long hair, no wedding ring
I saw you lookin' from across the way and now I really wanna know your name
She got the mm, white dress, but when she's wearin' less
You know that she drives me crazy
The mm, brown eyes, beautiful smile
You know I love watching you do your thing
I love her hips, curves, lips say the words, "Te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami"
I kiss her, this love is like a dream
Join me in this bed that I'm in
Push up on me and sweat, darling
So I'm gonna put my time in
Won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
In that water, be free
Come south of the border with me, hey
Lights down for the one I love
Right now, you never looked better
Forget our friends, girl, I love it when we chill together
And ain't nobody gonna feel what we feel together
She want a kiss, I, I want another one
Got a sick vibe, I wanted more than one
Up to now, nobody knew where I was comin' from but we got the same mind
Girl, you just own it
Girl, you just own it
'Cause your body's on fire
Show me how to control it
Go hit your spliff and get higher
Girl, I love how you roll it
I put my hand there
Hold it, I'ma be right by ya
I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
Then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?" (hell-yeah)
You know I love it, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that
Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say
I always feel like I'm nobody
But who wants to fit in anyway?
(Sing with me)
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when I'm with my baby, yeah
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
You're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when I'm with my baby, yeah
(Hands in the air)
I don't like nobody but you, I hate everyone here
I don't like nobody but you, baby, I don't care
I don't like nobody but you, I hate everyone here
I don't like nobody but you
(Everybody sing)
I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when I'm with my baby, yeah
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
Making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when I'm with my baby, yeah
When I'm with my baby, yeah
