Girl, I'm ready, if you're ready, now
Ooh, is it ever gonna be?
If you're with it, then I'm with it, now
To accept all responsibility
I'd go out of my way
To live by the words that you say
I don't wanna be the same
Maybe you could change me
♪
Maybe you could change me, oh
Maybe you could be the light
That opens up my eyes
Make all my wrongs right
Change me (change me), change me (change me)
Don't fight fire with fire
If I'm screaming, talk quieter
Understanding and patience
Feel the pain that I'm facing
Be like serenity
Help me position my mind
Take a chance
Make a difference in my life
Maybe you could change me
♪
Maybe you could change me (maybe you could change me)
Maybe you could be the light (you could be the light)
That opens up my eyes (opens up my eyes)
Make all my wrongs right
Change me (change me), change me (change me)
Girl, I'm ready, if you're ready, now
