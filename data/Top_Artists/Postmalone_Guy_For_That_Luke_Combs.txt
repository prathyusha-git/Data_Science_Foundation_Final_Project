I got a guy to sight in my rifle
My mama's new boyfriend re-binds Bibles
Ricky down the road, he resoles Red Wings
Hell, I got a guy for every damn thing
Oh, that ain't exactly what I'm lookin' for
'Cause I'm lookin' for
Someone to put her tires back in the drive
And if they don't, then I just might
Lose what's left of my never-lovin' mind
I'm damn near down to my last dime
I'm pretty good at breakin' down a heart
But pickin' up the pieces is the hard part
She's searchin' for someone who's gonna build it back
But I ain't got a guy for that
Ain't got a guy for that
Ain't got a guy for that
Ain't got a guy for that
Know a V.I.P. up at M.I.T.
And he still won't let me fly the time machine
Someone to turn back the hands on my new AP
But, buddy, what I really need
Is someone to put her tires back in the drive
And if they don't, then I just might
Lose what's left of my never-lovin' mind
I'm damn near down to my last dime
I'm pretty good at breakin' down a heart
But pickin' up the pieces is the hard part
She's searchin' for someone who's gonna build it back
But I ain't got a guy for that
Ain't got a guy for that
Ain't got a guy for that
Ain't got a guy
I ain't got a guy for that
Ain't got a guy for that
Ain't got a guy for that
Ain't got a guy
I ain't got a guy for that
