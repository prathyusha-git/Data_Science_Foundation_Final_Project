The 'Who's Who' of 'Who's That?'
Is poised for the attack
But my bare hands paved their paths
You don't get to tell me about 'sad.'
♪
If you wanted me dead,
You should've just said
Nothing makes me feel more alive
So I leap from the gallows
And I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch
As I scream:
"Who's afraid of little old me?!"
You should be.
♪
The scandal was contained
The bullet had just grazed
At all costs, keep your good name
You don't get to tell me you feel bad.
♪
Is it a wonder I broke?
Let's hear one more joke
Then we could all just laugh
Until I cry
So I leap from the gallows
And I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch
As I scream:
"Who's afraid of little old me?!"
I was tame, I was gentle
Til the circus life made me mean
Don't you worry folks,
We took out all her teeth
Who's afraid of little old me?!
Well you should be, you should be, you should be
Well you should be, you should be, you should be
So tell me everything is not about me.
But what if it is?
Then say they didn't do it to hurt me
But what if they did?
I want to snarl and show you
just how disturbed this has made me
You wouldn't last an hour
In the asylum where they raised me
So all you kids can sneak into my house, with all the cobwebs
I'm always drunk on my own tears
Isn't that what they all said?
That I'll sue you if you step on my lawn
That I'm fearsome and I'm wretched
And I'm wrong
Put narcotics into all of my songs
And that's why you're still singing along ...
So I leap from the gallows
And I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch
As I scream:
"Who's afraid of little old me?!"
I was tame, I was gentle
Til the circus life made me mean
Don't you worry folks, we took out all her teeth
Who's afraid of little old me?!
Well you should be, you should be, you should be
Cause you lured me, and you hurt me, and you taught me
You caged me,
And then you called me crazy
I am what I am cause you trained me
So who's afraid of me?
So who's afraid of little old me?
Who's afraid of little old me...?
