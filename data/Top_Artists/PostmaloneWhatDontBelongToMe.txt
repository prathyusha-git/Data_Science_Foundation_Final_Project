I can wrap a rope around the moon
Tie it up and drag it down to you
Honey, if you ask me to
You know I'd try it
I can put some diamonds 'round your neck
Dancin' in a ruby red sunset
Girl, if you don't wanna land this jet
Let's keep on flyin'
Every string
Every chord
My guitar
I'll give you everything
In the world
But my heart
Cuz I gave half to them half-way lovers
I left some to them two drunk summers
Left a piece at the bar with the keys to my car
I know I'm never gettin' it back
I lost a lot to that whiskey sippin'
I gave the rest to that rock star livin'
Take all of me, but there's one thing missin'
Baby, I can't give you what don't belong to me
What don't belong to me
What don't belong to me (what don't belong to me)
What don't belong to me, what don't belong to me
I can lay you down, I can change your life
Maybe not forever naw but baby, for the night
If I knew I'd meet you one day
I woulda never gave it all away
And I wish
I could give
You the best
'Cuz you deserve much more
Than this hole
In my chest
Cuz I gave half to them half-way lovers
I left some to them two drunk summers
Left a piece at the bar with the keys to my car
I know I'm never gettin' it back
I lost a lot to that whiskey sippin'
I gave the rest to that rock star livin'
Take all of me, but there's one thing missin'
Baby, I can't give you what don't belong to me
What don't belong to me
What don't belong to me (what don't belong to me)
What don't belong to me, what don't belong to me
Yeah, you keep holdin' but it's gone when it's gone
And you can't replace it
Baby, let's just face it
Baby, let's just face it
Cuz I gave half to those half-way lovers
I left some to them two drunk summers
Left a piece at the bar with the keys to my car
I know I'm never gettin' it back
I lost a lot to that whiskey sippin'
I gave the rest to that rock star livin'
Take all of me, but there's one thing missin'
Baby, I can't give you what don't belong to me
What don't belong to me
What don't belong to me (what don't belong to me)
What don't belong to me
What don't belong to me (what don't belong to me)
What don't belong to me
What don't belong to me (what don't belong to me)
What don't belong to me
What don't belong to me (what don't belong to me)
