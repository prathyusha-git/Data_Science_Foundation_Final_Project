"Te amo, te amo," she says to me
I hear the pain in her voice
Then we danced underneath the candelabra, she takes the lead
That's when I saw it in her eyes, it's over
Then she said, "Te amo"
Then she put her hand around me waist, I told her no
She cried, "Te amo"
I told her, "I'm not gonna run away, but let me go"
But my soul is awry, without asking why
I said, "Te amo"
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said
Don't it mean "I love you"?
Think it means "I love you"
Don't it mean "I love you"?
"Te amo, te amo," she's scared to breathe
I hold her hand, I got no choice, uh
Pulled me out on the beach, danced in the water, I start to leave
She's begging me and asking why it's over
Then she said, "Te amo"
Then she put her hand around me waist, I told her no
She cried, "Te amo"
I told her, "I'm not gonna run away, but let me go"
But my soul is awry, without asking why
I said, "Te amo"
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said
Don't it mean "I love you"?
Think it means "I love you"
Don't it mean "I love you"?
Listen, we can dance, but you gotta watch your hands
Watch me all night, I move under the light because I understand
That we all need love, and I'm not afraid
I feel the love, but I don't feel that way, no
Then she said, "Te amo"
Then she put her hand around me waist, I told her no
She cried, "Te amo"
I told her, "I'm not gonna run away, but let me go"
But my soul is awry, without asking why
I said, "Te amo"
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said
Don't it mean "I love you"?
Think it means "I love you"
Don't it mean "I love you"?
I think it means "I love you, I love you"
"Te amo, te amo"
Don't it mean "I love you"?
