I'm running out of time
And you'll always be on my mind
And I can't make you stay in this broken place
And I hope you find peace
Close your eyes as I put us to sleep
Finally
To sleep
Finally
And I can't make you stay
In this broken place
And I hope you find peace
Close your eyes as I put us to sleep
Finally
Go to sleep
Finally
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
I'm home alone
My trauma, alone
I can't make you stay in this broken place
Won't you find peace?
Close your eyes and I put us to sleep
Whoa, oh, oh
To sleep, woah
Na-na-na-duh-na-na
Whoa, no, no
Na-na-na-na
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
