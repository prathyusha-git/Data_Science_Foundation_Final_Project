I found a new muse
That's bad news for you
Why would I keep you around?

Yeah, whoa, yeah
And I wrote, licks I hit on my ones when I didn't have no friends to ride
Sticks on my dawgs, and I can't even lie to you
Got too much pride for you
Gotta stay safe in these streets
Streets don't play favorites, though
I'm not afraid of it though
God is okay with me, so
Life of that shade that you throw
I've seen you take it low
Limbo right under that hoe
Fuck out my face
I found a new muse
That's bad news for you
Why would I keep you around?

Once is a lot of things
Twice is a decision
Told me a lot of things
Forced into submission, got you Mercedes Benz
But that don't make you driven
What can I do for you? How can I make a difference?
Friendship and loyalty, that's not what it's giving
Giving that, "Why would I keep you around?"
Why would I keep you around?
Why would I keep you around?
Why would I keep you around?
Why would I keep?
