Pretty girl, all she ever do is take selfies
So she only fuckin' with a nigga 'cause I'm wealthy
Back when I was broke, I couldn't find no one to help me
Now it ain't a motherfuckin' thing they can tell me (get up)
Ye got the rhythm, make the ladies go brazy
Dolla got the stroke, make her wanna have my babies
Wheezy got a baddie on the couch with him right now
If that pussy good, I'ma put her on the flight
On sight, when I see you, it's on sight
When ya man ain't loving you right, somebody else will
And I might be that somebody else, for real
Tonight, tell him you ain't comin' home tonight
And you won't be alone, no lie
You know I'ma slide, slide, slide (get up)
Slide in, slide in, would you ride?
Baby, would you ride with me? (Get up)
Slide in, slide in, would you ride?
Baby, would you ride for me? (Get up)
She know what I like, got me in a twilight
Headed to the high-rise, cruisin' like Eyes Wide Shut
But I slide in it like a drive-by
The industry don't like me, tell them pussy niggas likewise (get up)
They tried to hit me with the cyanide, nice try
If you play with one of my guys, it's gon' be a homicide twice
We gon' paint the city red, it's tie-dye, ask Ty (get up)
Addicted to the nightlife, jumping off a jet, skydive
Your life a movie, mine a sci-fi (get up)
Told her friends she a ten, I lied
Really, she in the high-fives (get up)
Slide in, slide in, would you ride?
Baby, would you ride with me? (Get up)
Slide in, slide in, would you ride?
Baby, would you ride for me? (Get up)
