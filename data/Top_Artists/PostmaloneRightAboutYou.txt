Would you still love me if we were down bad and out a home?
I made all my money singin' so sad and lonely songs
But all my diamonds came from dirt, the more I love you, the less I hurt
And now my pen can't find the words
I wrote songs about sinnin', evil women, pills, and cars
I wrote songs about drinkin' 'til you walked in and raised the bar
But who am I to write rock-bottom from the highs you took me to?
Thank God I was right about you
♪
You can say you hate me as long as you don't mean it
Maybe go half crazy, don't need a rhyme or reason
Girl, you can go and pick a fight, slam that door and lock me outside
Just for one night so I can find a brand-new melody
I wrote songs about sinnin', evil women, pills, and cars
I wrote songs about drinkin' 'til you walked in and raised the bar
But, who am I to write rock bottom from the highs you took me to?
Thank God I was right about you
♪
I could change up all the chords, get my fingers flowin' free
But as long as you're with me, I can have my harmony
I wrote songs about sinnin', evil women, pills, and cars
I wrote songs about drinkin' 'til you walked in and raised the bar
But who am I to write rock bottom from the highs you took me to?
Thank God I was right about you
