One touch and you got me stoned
Higher than I've ever known
You call the shots and I follow
Sunrise, but the night still young
No words, but we speak in tongues
If you let me, I might say too much
Your touch blurred my vision
It's your world and I'm just in it
Even sober I'm not thinkin' straight
'Cause I'm off my face, in love with you
I'm out my head, so into you
And I don't know how you do it
But I'm forever ruined by you, ooh-ooh-ooh
Can't sleep 'cause I'm way too buzzed
Too late, now you're in my blood
I don't hate the way you keep me up
Your touch blurred my vision
It's your world and I'm just in it
Even sober I'm not thinkin' straight
'Cause I'm off my face, in love with you
I'm out my head, so into you
And I don't know how you do it
But I'm forever ruined by you, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
'Cause I'm off my face, in love with you
I'm out my head, so into you
And I don't know how you do it
But I'm forever ruined by you, ooh-ooh-ooh
By you, ooh-ooh-ooh
