Ba-ba-da, ba-da
Ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da, ba-da, ba
She's a stranger to the night shift
The type of girl you only dream about
I was lost under the lights, yeah (yeah)
An angel in the flames, she pulled me out
Next time that I g-g-g-g-get her
I'ma tell her in every kind of way (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I would walk through burning fire
Even if your kiss could kill me
You know I would die for you
Yeah, I would die for you (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Pain and passion, my desire
You're the right now and what will be
You know I would die for you
The rest of my life for you
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
(Ba-ba-da, ba-da)
I would die for you (ba-ba-da, ba-da, ba)
She's a danger to the mindset
Displaced and stretched it out in every way
Crossin' every line, yeah
T-t-touch base until you find the chemistry
And I know this ain't rocket science
And I never leave the house
Without checking on your first
And begin to wonder
Next time that I g-g-g-g-get her
I'ma tell her in every kind of way (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I would walk through burning fire
Even if your kiss could kill me
You know I would die for you (die for you)
Yeah, I would die for you (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Pain and passion, my desire
You're the right now and what will be
You know I would die for you (die for you)
The rest of my life for you
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah
Oh, I would die, I would die, I would die
Oh, I would die, I would die, I would die
I would walk through burning fire
Even if your kiss could kill me
You know I would die for you (I would die for you)
Yeah, I would die for you (I would die for you, baby)
Pain and passion, my desire
You're the right now and what will be
You know I would die for you (die)
The rest of my life for you
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah
Yeah
I would die for you
