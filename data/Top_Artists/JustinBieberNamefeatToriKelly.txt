You're making promises to someone else's face
If those should break, call out my name
You're getting high off of some new life that you made
If that high fades, call out my name
I know you think about laying side by side
On the goodwill couch
Going line for line, at your best friend's house
We're only getting better at pretending we're okay
And after all this time, we feel the same
Ooh-ooh
Ooh
Ooh-ooh
Cards on the table that we never got to play
Oh, what a shame, call out my name
I bet he's cool but I'd put fire in your veins
If you miss that flame, call out my name
I know you think about laying side by side
On the goodwill couch
Going line for line, at your best friend's house
We're only getting better at pretending we're okay
And after all this time
I know you think about laying side by side
On the goodwill couch (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Going line for line (going line for line), at your best friend's house
We're only getting better at pretending we're okay (yeah)
And after all this time, we feel the same
Ooh-ooh
Ooh
Ooh-ooh
