Welcome to the world
I heard your heartbeat and lost every word
Just stood there quietly
Taking in the sound of our love
This is gonna hurt
But I'll stand beside you for better or for worse
And I will find you whenever you're lost
I'll be right here
And ooh, I know that everything's changing
Ooh, and I don't wanna miss a thing
Ooh, I know that life won't ever be the same
And this love won't ever go away
Welcome to the world
Through all the pain, you're a diamond in the dirt
Don't let them change you, words are only words
Just like "I love you"
And yes you were the first
A new beginning, bright and unreserved
A beautiful red flower in the earth
Will grow, and I know
Ooh, I know that everything's changing
Ooh, and I don't wanna miss a thing
Ooh, I know that life won't ever be the same
And this love won't ever go away
Welcome to the world
Welcome to the world
Oh, welcome to the world (welcome to the world)
Hmm, welcome to the world (welcome to the world), mm
Ooh, I know that everything's changing
Ooh, and I don't wanna miss a thing
Ooh, I know that life won't ever be the same
And this love won't ever go away
You got the kick? (It's just kicks)
Is it actually? (Yeah)
