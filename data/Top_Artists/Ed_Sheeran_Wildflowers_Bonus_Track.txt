Ivy vines that clothe the tree
Daisies look and take a peek
Sun takes colours from the green
And bleaches
December white, a cotton dress
Open lawn to make a nest
Try to think what I love best
In your features
You were born to run and run
'Til you find your fire
I saw what you'd become
I know, I know
Blossoming among the wildflowers, flowers
♪
Daggers white, they cut through skin
A new addition to your grin
To reach the end we must begin
To feel it
Lie and trace you on the grass
Hair that makes a question mark
You'll always be in my heart
I mean it
You were born to run and run
'Til you find your fire
I saw what you'd become
I know, I know
Blossoming among the wildflowers, flowers
