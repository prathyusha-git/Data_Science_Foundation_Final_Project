This the first time in a long time, this the first time in a long
This the first time in a long time, this the first time in a long
This the first time in a long time, this the first time in a long
This the first time in a long time, this the first time in a long
I could see, I could breathe
Jesus freed me, Jesus freed me
Now I'm free
I got kicked out the house
For takin' sugar out the house
Steady, they don't wanna accept me
My doctors on Sebi, my Christ is on heavy
My diamonds on Betty, bossed up, it's on jetty
My diamonds on petty, lightsaber like the Jedi
Sauce on like a medi', pour some for the fetty
While I poppin' the man, the game, the world, the losers sold off
Walk in the sand, I combin' the doors, I give them more, though
This year, I lost my best man and I lost my spouse
Only billionaire you know that's sleepin' on the couch (what?)
This the first time in a long time, this the first time in a long
This the first time in a long time, this the first time in a long
This the first time in a long time, this the first time in a long
This the first time in a long time, this the first time in a long
Let it rain, rain, rain
I need you, run with a main
Let it rain, rain, rain
Hopin' my mama I gain
What is they thinkin' to gain?
What is they lookin' to gain?
Everything is in the future, I know it's just something
They bump for the change, baby
This the first time in a long time, this the first time in a long
This the first time in a long time, this the first time in a long (yeah)
This the first time in a long time (yeah), this the first time in a long (Draco)
This the first time in a long time (Soulja), this the first time in a long
This the first time in a long time
Used to be broke but I'm on now
I was just stuck at the bottom, grindin'
Now I'm shinin', sittin' at the top
I was just stuck in my feelings
Now I'm just ridin' 'round playin' with millions
Now I'm havin' racks to the ceilin'
Stackin' up cash, what a wonderful feelin'
We used to go walk in the mall to go shop
But now, we can walk in and buy the whole buildin'
We havin' mansions with acres
But honestly, we used to live in the trenches
I'm on fire like a candle
And God ain't gon' give you no fight you can't handle
Back in the trap, we ain't even have cable
Now I see my face on the channel
And R.I.P. Virgil, that Off-White is on me
The 'Rari, it's swervin'
I went to jail for that Draco
I guess that nobody perfect
Ain't give me no bond
I sat in that cell for a long time
Big Draco, big Ye
First time in a long time
This the first time in a long time, this the first time in a long
This the first time in a long time, this the first time in a long
This the first time in a long time, this the first time in a long
This the first time in a long time, this the first time in a long
