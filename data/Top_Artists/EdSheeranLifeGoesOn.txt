It hit like a train, I ran out of words
I got nothing to say, everything hurts
And I know love leads to pain
But memories serve our sweetest refrain, mmm
The waves came tumbling down
As you float away, I'm reaching for ya
To tell me how, how my life goes on with you gone
I suppose I'll sink like a stone
If you leave me now, oh, the storms will roll
Easy come, hard go, then life goes on
♪
I miss the flames, the heated reserve
Oh, I'd remember the way that you put me first
And what a heart-wrenching shame
That you'll never know, just like tears in the rain, mmm
A constant grey in the clouds
When I hear your name, I think of love
So, tell me how, how my life goes on with you gone
I suppose I'll sink like a stone
If you leave me now, oh, the storms will roll
Easy come, hard go, then life goes on
Ayy-yeah, life goes on
Ayy-yeah
I watched the sun setting down
I am so afraid, I need you now
To tell me how, how my life goes on with you gone
I suppose, I'll sink like a stone
If you leave me now, oh, the storms will roll
Easy come, hard go, then life goes on
Easy come, hard go, then life goes on
