Oh, I'm a mess right now, inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender, but this is not the end
I can't work it out, how
Going through the motions
Going through us
And, oh, I've known it for the longest time and all of my hopes
All of my own words are all over, written on the signs
When you're on my road, walking me home
Home, home, home, home
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright, I wanna feel your love, no
Easy baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach
I messed up this time, late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion with fingers intertwined
I can't shake this feeling now
We're going through the motions, hoping you'd stop
And, oh, I've only caused you pain, you know
That all of my words will always be low
Of all the love we spoke
When you're on my road, walking me home
Home, home, home, home
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright, I wanna feel your love, no
Easy, baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach
And for how long I love my lover
For how long I love my lover and now, now?
For how long-long I love my lover now, now?
For how long-long I love my lover now, now?
(For how long-long I love my lover now, now?) And I feel love
(For how long-long I love my lover now, now?)
I feel it all over now, now, and I feel love
(For how long-long I love my lover now, now?)
I feel it all over now, now, and I feel love
(For how long-long I love my lover now, now?)
I feel it all over now, now, and I feel love
(For how long-long I love my lover now, now?)
I feel it all over now, now, and I feel love
(For how long-long I love my lover now, now?)
I feel it all over now, now, and I feel love
For how long I love my lover now, now?
For how long-long I love my lover?
