California sober on the highway 1
Over on the shoulder thought I saw some fun
Lookin' for a ride
Trouble in some daisies holdin' out her thumb
Stole some sucker's money now she's on the run
And she wanna get high
She said I'll take you on a little trip
C'mon give these lips a try
♪
She drank up all my whiskey blew down all my smoke
I became the punchline of some cosmic joke
Damn bottle was dry
Kinda wanted to cry
She whispered, "pull it over," I said, "you're the boss"
In a southern drawl said "here's where I get off"
I've enjoyed our time
She said baby give me one more kiss
Before I kiss your ass goodbye
♪
Needed me some diesel just to get back home
Tried to pay the man and found my money gone
Had to bum a ride
So if you see them daisie's walkin' 'round
Son you best just pass 'em by
♪
And if you see a wallet on the ground
Bet yo ass that shit is mine
