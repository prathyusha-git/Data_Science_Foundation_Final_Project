(Don't you dare touch that dial)
(Because like the song says you are out of time) I feel it coming, hey
(I feel it coming)
(I feel it coming) I feel it coming
(I feel it coming) said it, I feel it all (I feel it coming)
(I feel it coming) oh
(I feel it coming) I feel it coming
(I feel it coming)
Tell me what you really like
Baby, I can take my time
We don't ever have to fight
Just take it step-by-step
I can see it in your eyes
'Cause they never tell me lies
I can feel that body shake
And the heat between your legs
I say
You've been scared of love and what it did to you
You don't have to run, I know what you've been through
Just a simple touch and it could set you free
We don't have to rush when you're alone, say
I feel it coming (say), I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming
I feel it coming (hey), I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, baby
You've been scared of love and what it did to you
You don't have to rush, I know what you've been through
But just a simple touch and it could set you free
We don't have to rush now when you're alone, say
I feel it coming (I feel it coming), I feel it coming (I feel it coming)
I feel it coming, I feel it coming babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming (oh baby), I feel it coming, babe (oh)
This is love (I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe)
I feel it coming (I feel it coming), I feel it coming, babe
