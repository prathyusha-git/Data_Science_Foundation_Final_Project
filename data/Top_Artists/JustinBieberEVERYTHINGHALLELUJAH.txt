Good morning, caught us dancing in the sunrise
Baby's crawling on the floor
And we don't have to go to Mississippi
Bring the river to your side
Baby, we find love in these moments
We don't even have to try
I could sing a song, but the words just wouldn't do
So I said hallelujah, hallelujah, baby
Uh
Let's take a walk, hallelujah
Sun is out, hallelujah
I'm kissin' you, hallelujah
Dream of you, hallelujah
Look at you, hallelujah
I'm lovin' you, hallelujah
Everything hallelujah
Everything hallelujah
Everything hallelujah
Remember times I was stranded all alone
Feelin' left out to dry
Now we circle back with tears in our eyes
Singing, hallelujah, hallelujah, baby
Somehow I could reach across your mind
I would pull out all the hurt
Try to write this song, but my words just wouldn't do
So I said hallelujah, hallelujah, baby
I'm kissin' you, hallelujah
Dream of you, hallelujah
Look at you, hallelujah
I'm lovin' you, hallelujah
Everything hallelujah
Everything hallelujah
Everything hallelujah
Everything hallelujah
Mom and Dad, hallelujah
Hailey, babe, hallelujah
Baby Jack, hallelujah
Oscar, Piggy, hallelujah
Brand new day, hallelujah
Brush my teeth, hallelujah
Take a swim, hallelujah
Everything hallelujah
Go outside, hallelujah
It's beautiful, hallelujah
It's rainin' hallelujah
Breathe the air, hallelujah
I'm singin' like hallelujah
Dancin' like hallelujah
Everything hallelujah
Everything hallelujah
Everything hallelujah
Everything hallelujah
Everything hallelujah
Everything hallelujah
Everything hallelujah
Everything hallelujah
Everything hallelujah
Everything hallelujah
