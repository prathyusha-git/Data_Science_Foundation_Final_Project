Once the flight had flown (ah-ha)
With the wilt of the rose (ah-ha)
I slept all alone (ah-ha)
You still wouldn't go
Let's fast-forward to 300 takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for something greater
Baby, was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear in your dream as you passed out
Baby, was it over then
And is it over now?

When you lost control (ah-ha)
Red blood, white snow (ah-ha)
Blue dress on a boat (ah-ha)
Your new girl is my clone
And did you think I didn't see you? There were flashing lights
At least I had the decency to keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs, and my whispered sighs, oh Lord
I think about jumping off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come running
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no
Let's fast-forward to 300 awkward blind dates later
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every model's bed for something greater
Baby, was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear in your dream as you passed out
Baby, was it over then
And is it over now?
