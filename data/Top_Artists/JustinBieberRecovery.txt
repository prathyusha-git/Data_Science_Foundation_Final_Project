First, I'll acknowledge our trust has been broken
A successful recovery, I pray for us at night
Blessed me with a second chance
Never thought I'd see your face again
Learned a lot through trial and error
Tryna make it right
Make it right
Make it right
Make it right
This time I'll do you right
Whoa-whoa, whoa
Missing your good intentions
Missing you from a distance
Hope you did the same
I know that I caused a problem
Know that I left you livid, pushed you far away
Learned it don't pay to lie
Costs more to see you cry
Sayin' nothing gets you nowhere fast
I'ma hold it back inside
Well now that I'm back around ya
Nothing else really matters
Hope you feel the same
First, I'll acknowledge our trust has been broken
A successful recovery, I pray for us at night
Blessed me with a second chance
Never thought I'd see your face again
Learned a lot through trial and error
Tryna make it right
Make it right
Make it right
Make it right
This time I'll do you right
Whoa-whoa, whoa
Going through all the motions tryna find a reason
Why we ended that way
Nothing in life is perfect
When you're changing like the seasons
That's what they used to say
'Cause going to sleep alone at night
I don't wanna close my eyes
Wanna give you all I have to give
No more holding back this time
Now that I'm back around, ya
Nothing around me matters
Hope ya feel the same
First, I'll acknowledge our trust has been broken
A successful recovery, I pray for us at night
Blessed me with a second chance
Never thought I'd see your face again
Learned a lot through trial and error
Tryna make it right
Make it right (make it right, make it right)
Make it right (make it right, make it right)
Make it right (make it right, make it right)
This time I'll do you right
Whoa-whoa, whoa (you know I'ma do you right)
You know I'ma do you right
You know I'ma do you right
You know I'ma do you right
I'ma do you right
You know I'ma do you right
