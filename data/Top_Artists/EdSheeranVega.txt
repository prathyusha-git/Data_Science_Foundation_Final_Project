Rain keeps beating on the rooftop, muddying the glass, but
God, I love the sound of heaven
Sat cross-legged on the carpet, listening to vinyl
Trying to ignore the weather
This week was heavy, I buckled under all the weight
What can you do, but pray?
And count your blessings, it wasn't any other way
Don't leave it up to fate
Fighting the tide, but the waves, they will part
Light up the night, we were made to be stars
But it burns like hell to be Vega
Clouds keep forming over this house, blocking out the sun
I'm trying to keep it all together
One door closes, then one opens, gotta keep the focus
If we believe, then she'll get better
The days are long, but they pass within an instant, babe
It is the strangest thing
I'll count my blessings the day I see you smile again
This war, we've got to win
Keep it inside, don't let no one see your heart
No one can judge, we're the same in the dark
Fighting the tide, but the waves, they will part
Light up the night, we were made to be stars
But it burns like hell to be Vega
Same problems, different options
Pain comes at a cost, but we've got this
Need rest bite, bleed time dry
She'll be fine, she'll be fine
Same problems, different options
Pain comes at a cost, but we've got this
Need rest bite, bleed time dry
She'll be fine, she'll be fine
Rain keeps beating on the rooftop, worrying to death, but
I guess this is human nature
We are made to shine like stars, but
That don't mean it don't burn like hell to be Vega
