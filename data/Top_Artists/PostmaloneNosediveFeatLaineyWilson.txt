I found God lookin' for the devil
Chasin' a high couldn't keep forever
It's always worse before the better I suppose
And how far down it's hard to tell
When to buy and when to sell
Cuz that comedown it hurts like hell
And every thorn has it's rose
Sometimes you're drivin'
Sometimes you're stallin'
Sometimes you're flyin'
Sometimes you're fallin'
But there's still beauty in the nosedive
Sometimes you're runnin'
Sometimes you're crawlin'
Sometimes you're broke
Sometimes you're ballin'
But there's still beauty in the nosedive
I hit rock and dropped the shovel
Clawed my way out past the rubble
Do my best stay outta trouble heaven knows
Sometimes the picture it ain't perfect
But there's learnin' in the hurtin'
Sick of barin' all the burden
Every thorn has it's rose
Sometimes you're drivin'
Sometimes you're stallin'
Sometimes you're flyin'
Sometimes you're fallin'
But there's still beauty in the nosedive
Sometimes you're runnin'
Sometimes you're crawlin'
Sometimes you're broke
Sometimes you're ballin'
But there's still beauty in the nosedive
On my descent
The turbulence
Is my best friend
Buckle up and enjoy the ride
I cut my line
Through pale blue sky
To remind me I'm alive
Sometimes you're drivin'
Sometimes you're stallin'
Sometimes you're flyin'
Sometimes you're fallin'
But there's still beauty in the nosedive
Sometimes you're runnin'
Sometimes you're crawlin'
Sometimes you're broke
Sometimes you're ballin'
But there's still beauty in the nosedive
Sometimes you're drivin'
Sometimes you're stallin'
Sometimes you're flyin'
Sometimes you're fallin'
But there's still beauty in the nosedive
