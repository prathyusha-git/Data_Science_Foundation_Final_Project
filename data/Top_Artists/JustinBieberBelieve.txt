Believe, believe, believe
I don't know how I got here
I knew it wouldn't be easy
But your faith in me was so clear
It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
But you knew one day I would be standing tall
Just look at me now
'Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be, if you didn't believe
Believe, yeah
There were days when I was just broken, you know (you know)
There were nights when I was doubting myself
But you kept my heart from falling
It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
You knew one day I would be standing tall
Just look at us now
'Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be, if you didn't believe
Where would I be if you
If you (if you didn't believe)
Would you know, how I feel touch the sky
If you didn't
Believe, believe, believe, yeah, ooh
Didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
You knew one day I would be standing tall
Just look at us now
'Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
But nothing if your heart didn't dream with me
'Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be, if you didn't believe, yeah
Where would I be, if you, yeah
If you didn't believe
Would you know, how I feel touch the sky
If you didn't believe
Where would I be, ooh
If you didn't believe
