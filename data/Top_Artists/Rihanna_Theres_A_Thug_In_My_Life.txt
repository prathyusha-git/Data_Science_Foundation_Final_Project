Yo, baby, y'all know
One is stupid, more space!
Y'all know yeah
Everybody needs someone to love
Yeah, everybody needs someone
Now watch in the feels
Gotta keep it on the down low
I'll never let my mama know
Only call him on my cell phone
Only see him after dark
I met him on the six train
Just the way he said my name
The brother had a lotta game
Had me open from the start
He scoops me up in his ride
Friday about a quarter to nine
So fly and so fine
And I'm so glad that he's all mine
There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama?
She's gonna say it ain't right
But he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything
I know his crew's kinda shady
Sometimes it gets kinda crazy
But he treats me like a lady
Gives me everything I need
I don't care who's hating on me
'Cause every night, he's waiting on me
He's got mad personality
A side they never see
My friends tell me to slow down
But every time that he's around
My heart's on lock down
I feel love and I'm so proud
There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama?
She's gonna say it ain't right
But he's so good to me (so good to me)
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything (give him everything)
Mama, don't worry, I'm not in a hurry
I won't disappoint you
I won't make you sorry
He's the one for me (he's all I ever need)
We'll be together from now 'til forever
I know it's the real thing
If you don't, whatever
And I know it's meant to be
I know it's meant to be
I know it's meant to be (there's a thug in my life)
How am I gonna tell my mama? (How am I gonna tell my mama?)
She's gonna say it ain't right
But he's so good to me (yeah)
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything (give him all of me)
Mama, don't worry, I'm not in a hurry (all of me)
I won't disappoint you
I won't make you sorry
He's the one for me...
