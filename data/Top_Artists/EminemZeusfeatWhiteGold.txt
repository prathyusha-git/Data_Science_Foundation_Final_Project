She says I am trash, but she listens to Tekashi (damn)
B- you lost me (yeah)
Fair weather, wishy-washy
She thinks Machine washed me (what?)
Swear to God, man, her favorite rapper wish he'd crossed me (yeah)
I love conflict, got a obnoxious (what?) subconscious (yeah)
I'm afraid to unlock it (nah)
Keep those monsters in the closet
I'm what an idiotic ('otic) savant is (savant is)
But I've been throwin' down
Gauntlets since that underground ruckus (yeah)
Where I planted my roots (what? Yeah)
That's how I had a whole planet that roots for me
As in the group, and no one thinks dark as I think (nah)
So imagine the havoc these black thoughts are to wreak
As in Trotter, I keep slaughterin' beats
Shout out to Beatminerz and T-Minus
But, me, long as I re-promise to be honest
And wholeheartedly, apologies, Rihanna
For that song that leaked, I'm sorry, Ri'
It wasn't meant to cause you grief
Regardless, it was wrong of me, but
I be on my own (yeah), head up in the clouds like Zeus
When they say, "You ain't the GOAT", I come down like, "Who?"
But I got my head in the clouds like Zeus
Swear, I could see the game from a bird's-eye view (ayy)
B-, you talkin' to a rap god (ayy)
Girl, you talkin' to a monsta (ayy)
You could give your whole damn life to the music thing
They gon' turn around like they don't love you
Yeah, they woke a giant up
So, when I get back on my feet, don't wonder why in the
Fuck is my head in the clouds (nah)
G5 with the stewardess, gettin' head in the clouds (haha)
Mile-high club (why?), I give a flying fuck (no)
Punchline, I'm just tryin' to
Survive in this climate of vaginas (bitch)
Who dyin' to cancel my ass like Aunt Jemima
Syrup, I'm a shit-stirrer, you're a dime-a
Dozen, said I couldn't do it
Hit Europe, kicked the door in, put a foot through it (ugh)
Like a stirrup (Stirrup)
Used to have to sit and watch them bills pile up (yeah)
Now, I just sit back and watch them bills pile up (haha)
I be on my own (yeah, woo), head up in the clouds like Zeus
When they say, "You ain't the GOAT", I come down like, "Who?"
But I got my head in the clouds like Zeus
Swear, I could see the game from a bird's-eye view (ayy)
B-, you talkin' to a rap god (ayy)
Girl, you talkin' to a monsta (ayy)
You could give your whole damn life to the music thing
They gon' turn around-
I seen them come and go
I've seen the hugest (hugest) debuts ('buts)
I've had a great view to see the (see the) game through (through)
And, Drake, they're gonna turn on you (you) one day too (too)
And the more you win, the sooner (sooner) they do
They'll be calling you a trash bin
Sayin' that your new one isn't better than your last and
Even if it is, once they start to turn their backs
They ain't never comin' back in
They did it to Chance
Next they'll be mentionin' Future in the past tense (yeah)
Or sayin' "Adios" to Migos
I ain't dissin', I'm just tryna keep this shit a C-note (yeah)
Same people been tryna do this shit to me, so
I call them peephole
Because they're so easy to see through 'em (see through 'em)
But a fighter's all I knew how to be
I got the shit beat out of me (yeah)
Tripped and fell and blew out a knee (pop)
Popped it back in and hopped up like, "Fuck it (fuck it)
Best two out of three", yeah
Man, I gotta be doin' (what?) somethin' right
I got 11 years of sobriety (yeah)
So, the only bottom I'ma be hittin' is if it's sodomy
Wait, I mean, you would think that somebody handed a saw to me
How I'm choppin' these bars
They keep wantin' me to rap responsibly
When I'm constantly passin' the buck like the fuckin' dollar tree
But I'ma always remind you that I came from poverty
Black people saved my life, from the Doc and Deshaun
And all that we want is racial equality
R.I.P. Laquan McDonald, Trayvon, and Breonna
Atatiana, Rayshard, and Dominique
Eric Garner and Rodney King
No, we can't get along 'til these white motherfuckin' cops
Who keep murderin' blacks are off the streets (off the streets)
And, as far as squashin' beef, I'm used to people knockin' me
But, just not in my camp
I'm diplomatic 'cause I'm tryna be
Last thing I need is Snoop doggin' me
Man, dog, you was like a (yeah) damn god to me
Nah, not really (haha)
I had "Dog" backwards
But I'm startin' to think, all these people takin' shots at me
Shit, it's no wonder
I be on my own, head up in the clouds like zeus
When they say, "You ain't the GOAT", I come down like, "Who?"
But I got my head in the clouds like Zeus
Swear, I could see the game from a bird's-eye view (ayy)
B-, you talkin' to a rap god (ayy)
Girl, you talkin' to a monsta (ayy)
You could give your whole damn life to the music thing
They gon' turn around like they don't love you
