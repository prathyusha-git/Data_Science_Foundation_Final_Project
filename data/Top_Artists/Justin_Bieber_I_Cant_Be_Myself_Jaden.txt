Be myself with you
Be myself with you
I can't be myself when you're not there
Ooh, woah, oh
La-la, la-la, la-la, I feel amazing
How are you? How are you?
La-la, la-la, la-la, ten thousand faces
Still your eyes are the view
What can I do?
When the chances are a billion stars, they can't compare to you
Nowhere to move
'Cause it's new to me, consuming me, I might be scared of you
Oh, yeah
I could travel any place but without you, it's just runnin' around
They could open Heaven's gates but without you
I'm just stuck in the clouds (yeah, yeah)
I can't be myself when you're not there
The sweetest dreams turn to nightmares
I can't be myself when you're not there
Oh-oh
La-la, la-la, la-la, I'm talkin' backwards
High on you, high on you
La-la, la-la, la-la, don't know what's after
But I know it's with you
What can I do?
When the chances are a billion stars, they can't compare to you
Nowhere to move
'Cause it's new to me, consuming me, I might be scared of you
Oh, yeah
I could travel any place but without you
It's just runnin' around (girl, I'm just runnin' around)
They could open Heaven's gates but without you
I'm just stuck in the clouds (yeah, yeah)
I can't be myself when you're not there
The sweetest dreams turn to nightmares
I can't be myself when you're not there (be myself)
Oh-oh
La-la, la-la, la-la, I feel amazing
How are you? How are you?
I can't be myself when you're not there (no, I can't)
The sweetest dreams turns in nightmares
I can't be myself when you're not there
Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
(Be myself with you)
Woah, ooh-ooh-oh-oh
(Be myself with you)
When you're not in my arms
I can't be myself when you're not there
I need you close
Ooh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I can't be myself when you're not there
