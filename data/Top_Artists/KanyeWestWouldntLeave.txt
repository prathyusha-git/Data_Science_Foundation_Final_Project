I don't feel that she's mine enough
God, I feel I couldn't have you windin' up
Butterfly in my wrist
You make pretty women out of my skin
And I don't feel like
And I know you wouldn't leave
They say, "Build your own," I said, "How, Sway?"
I said, "Slavery a choice", they say, "How, Ye?"
Just imagine if they caught me on a wild day
Now I'm on 50 blogs gettin' 50 calls
My wife callin', screamin', say, "We 'bout to lose it all!"
Had to calm her down 'cause she couldn't breathe
Told her she could leave me now
But she wouldn't leave
And I know you wouldn't leave
And I sometimes wish
We doin' such things
We could wait longer than these
Yes, you know you're one of these
We can run through with the top dropped, yeah
And the sundress down, ooh
♪
And I know you wouldn't
Oh, don't bring that up
That's gon' get me sentimental
You know I'm sensitive
I got a gentle mental
Every time something happen
They want me sent to mental
We had an incident but I cover incidentals
You want me working on my messaging
When I'm thinking like George Jetson
But soundin' like George Jefferson
Then they questionin' my methods then
If you tweakin' out my texts again then I don't get reception here
I got the mind state to take us past the stratosphere
I use the same attitude that done got us here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after here
Plus, what was meant to be was meant to be
Even if, publicly, I lack the empathy
I ain't finna talk about it, 'nother four centuries
One and one is two but me and you, that's infinity
I don't feel that she's mine enough
God, I feel I couldn't have you windin' up (why?)
Butterfly in my wrist
You make pretty women out of my skin (out of my skin)
And I don't feel like (uh)
And I know you wouldn't leave
(Love me or hate me)
For any guy that ever fucked up (love me or hate me)
Ever embarrassed they girl (love me or hate me)
Ever embarrassed they wife (gone when you miss me)
She told you not to do that shit (oh)
She told you you's gon' fuck the money up
But you ain't wanna listen, did you?
Keep that same energy
Keep that same energy
Now you testin' her loyalty
This what they mean when they say
For better or for worse, huh?

For every down female that stuck with they dude
