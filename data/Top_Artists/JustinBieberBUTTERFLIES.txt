When the money comes
And the money goes
Only thing that's left
Is the love we hold
Mix of pain and pleasure
Never black and white
Cuz the sun keep shining
When i close my eyes

Butterflies
Won't go away
These butterflies
Won't seem to go away
We'll just keep moving and moving and moving and moving and slippin away
We'll just keep moving and moving and moving and moving and slippin away

We just keep moving and moving and moving and moving and moving and moving and
Moving

This wounded heart can't live
Can't live without you
And this perfect harmony
Found us where we are
