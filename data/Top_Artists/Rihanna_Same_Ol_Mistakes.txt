I can just hear them now
"How could you let us down?"
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way 'round
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
One by one, every trait
I tried but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
When I breathe in too deep
Going with what I always longed for
Feel like a brand new person (but you make the same ol' mistakes)
Well, I don't care, I'm in love (stop before it's too late, I know)
Feel like a brand new person (but you make the same ol' mistakes)
I finally know what it's like (you don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it's too late)
(I know there's too much at stake)
Making the same mistakes (and I still don't know why it's happening)
Stop while it's not too late (and I still don't know)
Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
Point is I have the right
Not thinking in black and white
Thinking it's worth the fight
Soon to be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for
Feel like a brand new person (but you make the same ol' mistakes)
Well, I don't care, I'm in love (stop before it's too late, I know)
Feel like a brand new person (but you make the same ol' mistakes)
So how do I know that it's right? (You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it's too late)
And I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe your story ain't so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons and she's got her regrets
And I know that it's hard to digest
A realization is as good as a guess
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons and she's got her regrets
But you've got your demons and she's got her regrets
Feel like a brand new person
So how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So, how will I know I've gone too far?
Stop thinking you're the only option, oh
Feel like a brand new person (but you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like (stop before it's too late)
Stop thinking you're the only option
In a new direction (but you make the same old mistakes)
So, how will I know I've gone too far? (You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it's too late)
Stop thinking you're the only option
Feel like a brand new person (but you make the same old mistakes)
And I don't know how to describe (stop before it's too late)
Stop thinking you're the only option
(But you make the same old mistakes)
(You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it's too late)
Stop thinking you're the only option (but you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like (stop before it's too late)
Stop thinking you're the only option
Stop thinking you're the only option
