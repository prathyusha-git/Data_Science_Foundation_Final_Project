Welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs
Something to inspire me, rather than society's
Woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit love
I want diamonds too, Ronnie on Player's Club
I used to have a nine-to-five, fresh out of school, that was '05
That bitch was racist, got me fired, ever since then, I had no job
Pushing in my momma van, stop for gas on Rosecrans
Trust me these niggas rushed me for something my cousin probably did
Guilty by association story of my life, nigga
You gon' make me flip and split yo' shit judge give me life, nigga
Pain since my grandma's death, Uncle killed at Louie's Burgers
Hold my tears, I tried my best, let it go, drenched my pullover
Cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin, margin
Maintaining my modest modus as I dream
So while I go through all this, all this bullshit what you call it
Life itself I know it helps let me scroll through my BlackBerry
(Hey, what's up, daddy?)
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright

So what'd you rush me out here for?
♪
How was your day? Are you tipsy?
♪
Mm-hm
All I need in this lifetime, pussy and Patrón
Gimme that, once you gimme that, once again it's on
Bitch, I'm swagged up, hoes bopping when I'm off that screw
Coming down clean, tell yo' baby momma what it do?
Where yo' friends at? I got long dick, what it is?
Go on poke it out, situate your lil' positives
How I live? Big shot, on my grind, all ready
I'ma lay it down like a carpenter, when you let me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
♪
I can't get enough, if I offend you, blame it on the liquor babe
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
I can't get enough, if I offend you
Uh, I wrote this song when Dave drove home
And caught that flat, in the mean T Flats
And it made me think, if we could blink
To change locations where we at
We often get lost in the alcohol bottle
In attempt to ignore pain, problem and sorrow
Just for a minute, then back to the bullshit
Your car note due and you 'bout to get evicted
Two drugs surely, Patrón, pussy, make it feel alright
But once it's empty and the bitch leave, then it's back to life
You can't run from it, gotta run to it, nigga
The antidote wouldn't last and you knew it, nigga
But still you proceed to dive deep, ask what's her zodiac sign
I'm going through something in life

Okay, welcome to my diary, hmm, where should I begin?
Finna get a swisher and fill it with at least a gram
Crackers watch my every step, man, I hate to work for them
One time I tried to work for me, but that shit didn't work for me
And here I am, stressing, questioning my direction, man
What to do? Nothing's moving, traffic jam, wiggle through it
Pop the cork and take the fluid, bust that pussy open
Bust that pussy open, bust that pussy open
(Soul) balls deep, ya dig? Retrieve, relief, ya dig?
Let's kill a bottle of tequila
And lie butt-naked telling the truth, would ya?
What's up? I had a long day and I really wanna fuck
Take a double shot to the face and forget about my whole day
'Cause all I've been thinking the whole day
I'm going through something in life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
