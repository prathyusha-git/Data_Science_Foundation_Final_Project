What is it about them?
I must be missing something
They just keep doing nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Better off without them
They're nothing but unstable
Bring ashtrays to the table
And that's about the only thing they share
I'm in their secondhand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny now or ever
(Can you check your Uber rating? Oh, my God)
(And it's like, wait, like, when?)
Wakin' up at sundown
They're late to every party
Nobody's ever sorry
Too inebriated now to dance
Morning as they come down (come down)
Their pretty heads are hurting (hurting)
They're awfully bad at learning (learn)
Make the same mistakes, blame circumstance
I'm in their secondhand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny now or ever
Please don't try to kiss me on the sidewalk
On your cigarette break
I can't afford to love someone
