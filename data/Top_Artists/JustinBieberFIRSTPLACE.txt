How do we get back again
How'd we get mixed up in the first place
A windows opening
You can't spread your wings in a birdcage
We get high and we go down again
We go round to right back where we been
And the days go by the nights they ever end
Do it all again
Cause when's it's on sight
It's on sight
All of it all of it can wait
It's a celebration
Like it's your birthday
It's so amazing
I just wanna taste ya
Let's celebrate
In the best way
Like it's your birthday
Oh all I see is you now
You in first place
Oh don't wanna lose you now
That's the worst case
Where do I begin
It's been this way for a long time
Something's gotta give
Cuz you keep on taking all mine
We get high and we go down again
We go round to right back where we been
And the days go by the nights they ever end
Do it all again
Cause when's it's on sight
It's on sight
All of it all of it can wait
It's a celebration
Like your birthday
It's so amazing
I just wanna taste ya
Let's celebrate
In the best way
Like it's your birthday
Oh all all I see is you now
You in first place
Oh don't wanna lose you now
That's the worst case
