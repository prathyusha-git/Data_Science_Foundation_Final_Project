Meet me, don't go tell my mama 'bout this, baby, hold up
We gon' own the summer
Never, never stressin', no, we always hit the numbers
'Cause always stressin', always cuffin' different numbers
Know we tired of makin' shit, you know the streets don't make diplomas
Drunk somethin', tryna find my keys
I find myself lookin' down at the stars, the bees
The stars align, remember when it was Ramadan
I try a line, might try some crime, might try to dime
But now it's time, baby, now it's time

The night is too young and the love in the air hit me
Follow all the vibes up in every city
Gamble with your life, thinkin' 'bout it
Home with you tonight, you don't want it with him
We raise our glasses, the madness
The tiny waist, the asses, dance in the trances
Baby said she ready and we 'bout to find out
Don't be mad that your girl a fine dime, we get it
Livin' live, Richard Pryor on a mission
And they lookin' like they know, but they didn't
Let me slip into my mode, little
Smokin' plenty with tequila, baby
Members of the rage run 'way with it
Fashion week in Paris, front row with it
Diamonds always dancin', no bullshit
They see a black god on the job, yeah, I'm so winnin'
