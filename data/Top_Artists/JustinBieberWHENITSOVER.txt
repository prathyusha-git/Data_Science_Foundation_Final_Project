I get in my head every time that we go blow for blow, babe
And the words that I throw ricochet, then they cut straight through me
Baby, make me bleed (mm)
The ceiling dissolves in the sky
And hello turns into goodbye
And the feeling's overwhelming, can't go on (on)
When it's over, over
When it's over, oh, whoo
When it's over, over, darling
When it's over, oh
In the morning, the weight isn't gone
'Til I lay my head at night (uh)
Why can't you just love me? Oh
I just fuckin' love
The ceiling dissolves in the sky
When hello turns into goodbye
And the feeling's overwhelming, can't go on (Can't go on)
When it's over, over
When it's over, oh, whoo
When it's over, over, darling
When it's over, oh, oh, babe
