You can't tell me, uh
To leave my shit at the door, yeah, uh
Can't take advantage of my abandonment issues (uh, yeah, uh, uh)
Oh, oh (yeah)
You just leave me dyin' (yeah)
Can't you see me cryin'? (Uh)
Hate it when we fightin' (yeah)
Said I wasn't lyin'
Wasn't lyin' when I said that I loved you (I loved you), oh-oh
I ain't lyin'
I don't like it when I feel so far from you (far from you)
Away from you (I don't like it)
Wasn't lyin' when I said that I loved you
Last night in the living room (living room, living room)
Last night, you were livid with me
Seen you roll your eyes, and
That's how now we talked it through
(Talked it through, talked it through, talked it through)
(Uh, yeah)
Oh, I thought that things had changed
They seemed to go sideways somehow (yеah, uh, yeah, uh)
You just leave mе dyin'
Can't you see me cryin'? (Uh)
Hate it when we fightin' (uh)
Said I wasn't lyin'
Wasn't lyin' when I said that I loved you (I loved you), oh-oh (oh-oh)
I ain't lyin'
I don't like it when I feel so far from you (far from you)
From you (from you, I don't like it)
Wasn't lyin' when I said that I loved you (I loved you), whoa
I ain't lyin'
Wasn't lyin' when I said that I loved you (I loved you)
Wasn't lyin'
Wasn't lyin' when I said that I loved you (I loved you)
Oh, no, I wasn't
I wasn't lyin' when I said that I loved you (I loved you)
I wasn't lyin'
I wasn't lyin' when I said that I loved you (I loved you)
Oh, I'll never leave, baby (baby)
