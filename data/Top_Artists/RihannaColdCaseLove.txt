On my roof
Dark and I'm burning a rose
I don't need proof
I'm torn apart and you know
What you did to me was a crime
Cold case love
And I let you reach me one more time
But that's enough uh-uh-uh
Your love was breaking the law, but I needed a witness (oh-oh)
So pick me up when it's over, it don't make any difference (oh-oh)
Will it ever be solved, or am I taking the fall?
Truth was there all along, tell me how did we miss it?
We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime of a cold case love (oh, oh)
♪
Should've investigated
But love blinded eyes couldn't see, no
And then I tried to cage it
But your love ain't the kind that you can keep
Release me now 'cause I did my time
Of this cold case love
My heart's no longer cold and confined
I've had enough, oh, oh
Your love was breaking the law, but I needed a witness (oh-oh)
So pick me up when it's over, it don't make any difference (oh-oh)
Will it ever be solved, or am I taking the fall? (Oh-no)
Truth was there all along, tell me how did we miss it?
We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love oh-oh
We lost our way
Took this too far
Now I'll never find the pieces of my heart
We've lost enough
Looking for a truth
That was here all along
Cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love
We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love, love
