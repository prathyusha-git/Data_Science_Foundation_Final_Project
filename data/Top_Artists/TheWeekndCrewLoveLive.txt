I wanna know if I sold this SoFi tonight
Woah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, let's go
Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This ain't no fucking sing-along
So, girl, what you singin' for?
It's cause we blowing like a C4
Twenty, get the bar rolling
Fake ID's in the trash, weed blowin'
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a hand full of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowin'
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Los Angeles
What
(They loving the crew)
They what?
(Lovin' the crew, they loving the crew)
Oh, they lovin' the crew
Oh, they lovin' the crew, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew, oh, woah
