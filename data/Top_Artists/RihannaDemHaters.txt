I'm not concerned with people
Who'll prey on the wealth of their fellowman
Oh yeah
'Cause they only wanna know you
Enroll you
Only for the things ya have
I just think it's so sad
Get dem haters out your circle
Haters
Smile in your face
But all they wanna do is bring ya down
Bring ya down, no, no (down)
Down, yeah
See them try to mess to hurt you
They're gonna try
And work you
Anything to bring ya down
Down, down
They keep evil thoughts in their hearts
What you don't know
You can't let them knock your hustle
Not letting them know how much you struggle
They turn green with envy when you're on top
And dem heart is full with strife
Their by gonna try to take your life
Dem haters
Get dem haters out your circle
All dem gonna smile in your face
But all they wanna do is bring ya down
Bring ya down
Down
See them try to mess to hurt you
And work you
Anything to bring ya down
To bring you down, down
Get dem haters out your circle
Smile in your face
But all they wanna do is bring ya down
All they wanna do is to bring you down
Down, down, down
See them try to mess to hurt you (you know they try)
And work you
Anything to bring ya down
Anything to bring you down
Down
Down
Ya know they talk about ya
And they tell the lies
Don't be fooled you betta recognize
They're not there for you
They don't care for you
Trust me, 'cause I know it's true
Ya know they smile in your face
And make ya think they down
Then they turn against you
When you're not around
It's just jealousy and dishonesty
So hold on to your sanity
Get dem haters out your circle

And make ya think they down
Then they turn against you
