Uh-uh, fuck that (Fuck that)
8 doobies to the face, fuck that
12 bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
2 pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist
Man, I swear my nigga trippin' off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in cold water
Then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
Hope that take the pain away
From the feeling that he feel today
You know when you part of Section .80
Feel like no one can relate
'Cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
Marijuana, endorphins, make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party trippin' off
My generation sippin' cough syrup like it's water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, not one our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition that the world is 'bout to end
Who gives a fuck? We never do listen
Unless it comes with an 808
(A melody and some hoes)
Playstation and some drank
(Technology bumping soul)
Looking around and all I see
Is a big crowd, that's product of me
And they probably relatives
Relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, her president is black, she black too
Purple label on her back, but that tab is light blue
She take it straight to the head
Then she look at me, she got A.D.H.D
8 doobies to the face, fuck that
12 bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
2 pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist
Like woah-oh-oh, woah
(Don't got a limit, just gimme some more with it)
(Don't got a limit just gimme some more with it)
(They always told me A.D.H.D did it)
And then she started
And then she started feelin' herself
Like no one else in this apartment
Beg your pardon
Oh, I rap baby, how old are you?
She say 22, I say 23
Okay then, we all crack babies
Damn, why you say that?
She said, where my drink at?
I'ma tell you later, just tell your neighbors
And the police relax
I stood up, shut the blinds
Closed the screen, jumbotron
Made to the back, where she reside
Then she said, read between the lines
Yep, hope that I get close enough
When the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up
When the Nuvo start to drown her body
And I, know the both of us really deep in the mood now
It's nothing we can do now
Somebody walked in with a pound
Of that Bay Area kush
She looked at me then looked, at it
Then she grabbed it
Then she said, get it understood
You know why we crack babies
Because we born in the 80s
That A.D.H.D crazy
8 doobies to the face, fuck that
12 bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
2 pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist
Like woah-oh-oh, woah
(Don't got a limit just gimme some more with it)
(Don't got a limit just gimme some more with it)
(They always told me A.D.H.D did it)
You can have all my shine
I'll give you the light
Double cup, deuce, four, six
Just mix it in Sprite
Ecstasy, 'shrooms, blow, dro, hoes
Whatever you like
You can have all my shine
I'll give you the light
