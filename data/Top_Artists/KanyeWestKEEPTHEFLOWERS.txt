Gonna set you free
They know something
Some things don't matter (set me free)
You excite me
You and time matter (he's gonna set you)
You excite me, I don't find out
You excite me, f- inside now
Why you so scared that somebody find out?
I am a flex, imagine your ex face when he find out
I am the best, you hit the top, wait 'til they find out (set me free)
He not a threat, send him a text, put him on timeout (set me free)
Keep the flowers, send a 100,000 (set me free)
Keep the flowers, send a 100,000 (set me free)
Keep the flowers, I said 100,000
Took you out that metro housin'
Dropped your name on my new album (he's gonna set you free)
Your life finna change right now (set me free)
Your life finna change right now
Balenciaga for all your friends
Hermès for the argument
Your life finna change right now (he's gonna set you free)

Don't bring friends around, I wouldn't - behind your back
That's the new rule, rules are rules, and not now then when
If not me then who?
You blacked out your page, went missing for days
They know you with me
You blacked out your page and switched up your boots
They know you with me
You switched up the Benz, you switched it again
I know what you need
You usually go combo, they don't even call you
Hold on, don't you see? (Gonna set you free)
Your life finna change right now (he's gonna set you free)
Your life finna change right now (he's gonna set you free)
Lord, take me
Lord, take me
Lord, take me where you wanna take me
