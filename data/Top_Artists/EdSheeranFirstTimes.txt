I thought it'd feel different, playin' Wembley
80 thousand singin' with me
It's what I've been chasin' 'cause this is the dream
♪
When it was all over, I cleared out the room
Grabbed a couple beers, just me and you
Then we started talking the way that we do
♪
Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man?
Little moments that pass us by
Oh, but I remember
The first kiss, the first night, the first song that made you cry
The first drink, red wine, on a step in Brooklyn, I
Still feel the first fight, and we both made it out alive
And I can't wait to make a million more first times
(Mmm, mmm)
The greatest thing that I have achieved
Was four little words, down on one knee
You said, "Darling, are you jokin'?", and I just said, "Please"
Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man?
Little moments that pass us by
Oh, but I remember
The first kiss, the first night, the first song that made you cry
The first look in your eyes when I said "I love you", I
Can still feel the butterflies from when we stumbled home that night
I can't wait to make a million more first times
(Mmm, mmm)
Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man?
Little moments that pass us by
Oh, but I remember
The first kiss, first night, first song that made you cry
First dance in moonlight in your parents' garden, I
Can't wait to see everything that's yet to be
Our first child and then a million more first times
