I spend my nights on overdrive
I live my life so overtired
And there's nowhere I can hide
Now I live my life on overdrive
I could be more like him
If that's cool with you
I'd do anything to be cool to you
Cool to you
I spend my nights on overdrive
I live my life so uninspired
There ain't no angels in this world
So I live my life on overdrive
I'd remove my tattoos
If that's cool to you
I'd do anything to be cool to you
Cool to you, uh
♪
I could end it with her
If that's cool to you
I'd do anything to be cool to you
