Yeah, whoa
Gunfire left a hole in the tank, losing gasoline
Fire is on my trail and it's after me
Hope it don't get hit before I get where I'm goin'
I gotta get where I'm goin', take off my mask to breathe
You could've been a part of a masterpiece
Fluid in the brakes was the last to leak
That's the thing
Where I'm goin', I don't need my brakes
Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through
The lovers need to clear the road, oh-oh
'Cause this thing is ready to blow, oh-oh
I just want to set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone, then you
Then you'll know where I'm comin' from
Fire bomb
Fire bomb
Seems cold, but baby, no, it doesn't have to be
Microwaving our metal tragedy
Watchin' it burn, and it's beautiful and it's blue
And it's pitiful when it's through, it's the other half of me
I didn't do it, you lit the match for me
Now we're flying from the blast, baby
That's the thing
Where we're goin', we don't need no brakes
Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through
The lovers need to clear the road, oh-oh
'Cause this thing is ready to blow, oh-oh
I just want to set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone, then you
Then you'll know where I'm comin' from
Fire bomb
Fire bomb
Baby, we were killin' 'em
They couldn't handle the millionth degree
We were criminals
'Cause we were burnin', the world called the police
Fire department, ambulance
You can call me crazy
'Cause I believe the only move for me and you
Is to go out blazin'
The lovers need to clear the road, oh-oh
'Cause this thing is ready to blow, oh-oh
I just want to set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone, then you
Then you'll know where I'm comin' from
Fire bomb (oh, oh, oh)
Fire bomb
