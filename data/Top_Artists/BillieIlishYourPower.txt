Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But havin' it's so strange
She said "you were a hero, you played the part"
"But you ruined her in a year, don't act like it was hard"
And you swear you didn't know (didn't know, didn't know)
No wonder why you didn't ask
She was sleepin' in your clothes (in your clothes, in your clothes)
But now she's got to get to class
How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad when they find out?
If you could take it all back
Would you?
Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But havin' it's so strange
I thought that I was special, you made me feel
Like it was my fault, you were the devil, lost your appeal
Does it keep you in control? (In control, in control)
For you to keep her in a cage?
And you swear you didn't know (didn't know, didn't know)
You said you thought she was your age
How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad if it turns out that they kill your contract?
Would you?
Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But power isn't pain
