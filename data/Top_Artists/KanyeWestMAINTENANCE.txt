I know your maintenance so high, high
High, high, sky-high
And that rent is sky-high
Penthouse suite, sky-high, sky-high
Tell 'em
I don't got a price, I don't got a price tag
I just tried out a nice bag
God just threw me a life raft
I've been livin' my life fast
Step in the moment, you right and
You not alone, you right back
Had to teach you how to fight back
Everybody not gon' like that
Overstaying, where yo' life at?
Get some real friends in your life back
People was givin' advice back
Tell them to take that advice back
Throw it away with they iPad
Broke a few bones on assignment
But you came home with a signed cast
Everything heals when the time pass
A moment of time
This is just a moment of time
I know your maintenance so high, high
High, high, sky-high
And that rent is sky-high
Penthouse suite, sky-high, sky-high
I know your maintenance so high, high
High, high, sky-high
And that rent is sky-high
Penthouse suite, sky-high, sky-high
