It's time to face the music (oh)
A stay of execution
No more distribution (the fuck you doin'?)
You did this to me
I'm right back on my bullshit, right back out in these streets
Just remember that you did this to yourself (yeah, you did it yourself)
Now, you gotta suffer the consequences
Back up to bat and swingin' for the fences (remember that)
Let's make one thing clear (here)
Here, my dear
My resolute for this year
No pollution, fresh air
My solution, long hair with a fat ass, I'm deadass
Mile high club 'til I jеt lag
Rothstein flow, Casino
And you're just like Ginger, we know
Singlе negro, I don't need your
(Double standards and hypocrisy)
And that fake handholdin' on Father's Day
You a different motherfucker when you not with me
Been sleepin' with the enemy, mockery
It's like I'm John F. Kennedy, shots at me
Yes, I'm president of debauchery
None of that bullshit ever got to me
'Cause your pillow Brillo, ditto
Breakin' this shit down little by little
I ain't got time for the fuckin' pom-poms
Shoulda never let this dog out of the kennel
Wastin' time, debatin' 'bout
Who I'm with when I'm not around
Just don't forget who you fuckin' with
When steppin' on hallowed ground
'Cause you did this to me (yeah, I'm)
Right back on my bullshit, right back on these streets
Just remember that you did this to yourself (yeah, you did it yourself)
But now you gotta suffer the consequences (and sorry isn't gonna help)
Now how many times have I got burnt
And tried to act like I'm not hurt?
Or take you back and we not workin'
Like clockwork, this shit is agony
You're draggin' me, Glocks burst
Just remember, you drawed first, you ain't toe taggin' me
Ho-bag, any blowback, you deserve
Get the bozack, bitch, my soul's blackening
So actually, this could've been a lot worse (watch)
I could've name-dropped you in my verse (yeah)
But out of respect for your daughter
I won't blow your spot up 'cause your toddler
Does not deserve to get caught up in our dirt (yeah)
And good luck with the father
Bitch, you're stuck with him now, ah-fuckin'-ha
Word to the doctor, these are wounds you cannot nurse
Hope it's drivin' you bonkers that I'm not yours (oh, no)
Guess I must've got wise, you are not sly
Just 'cause you can make up an on-the-spot lie
I'm comin' out, guns blazin', shots fired
Hand sani', I'm cutting off ties
Bitch, everything you own's in a box, bye
Guess it's back to the trailer and pot pies
Hope I pull up to the window at Popeyes
One day and you'll be servin' me hot fries (you did this to me)
Taste of your own medicine, you shedded skin
Yeah, you reptilian bitch
Off with your knees (yeah), beggin' for forgiveness
Yeah, look at you, marry him again, bitch
You ain't Em's bitch, you just regular him's bitch
We will never be together again, ever
And when you're in bed with him and you wish you was with me
Just remember that
You did this to me (yeah, now)
I'm right back on my bullshit
Right back out on these streets (look what you did)
Just remember that you did this to yourself (yeah, you did it yourself)
Now, you gotta suffer the consequences (and sorry isn't gonna help)
Remember that (Michelle) you did this to me (yeah)
I'm right back on my bullshit
Right back out in these streets (fuck around and made you famous)
Just remember that you did this to yourself (yeah, you did it yourself)
But now you gotta suffer the consequences
(So when I'm hittin' someone else and you're)
Wastin' time, debatin' 'bout
Who I'm with when I'm not around
Just don't forget who you fuckin' with
When steppin' on hallowed ground
