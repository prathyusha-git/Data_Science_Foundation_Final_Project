You came from Heaven to Earth (oh, yeah, You did)
To show the way (to show the way)
From the Earth to the cross (from the Earth to the cross)
My sinful debt to pay
From the cross to the grave (oh-oh)
From the grave to the sky (from the grave to the sky)
And Lord, I lift Your name on high (I lift Your name on high)
Lord, I lift Your name on high (I do)
Lord, I love to sing Your praises (I, I lift Your name)
I'm so glad You're in my life (I'm so glad, I'm so glad, I'm so glad)
Anybody that feel that way? (I'm so glad, I'm so glad)
I'm so glad You came to save us (ooh, ooh)
You came from Heaven to Earth (yes, You did)
To show the way (to show the way)
From the Earth to the cross (to the cross)
My sinful debt to pay
