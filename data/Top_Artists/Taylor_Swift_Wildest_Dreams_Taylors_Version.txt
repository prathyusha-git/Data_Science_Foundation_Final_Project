He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
He's so tall, and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha

I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good now
He's so tall, and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request, it is
Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha (ah-ah, ha)
Wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha
You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me, I bet these memories
Follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night

Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe

Say you'll see me again, even if it's just pretend
Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
