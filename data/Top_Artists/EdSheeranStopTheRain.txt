Another human cloud to bring you down when you blew the last away
And bring out a poisoned tongue or plastic crown
But for me, they look the same
Sometimes, it can get all too much for me
And that's why the photograph gets burned
Throw the match in gasoline, a-ayy
Don't let the ones who hurt you see you cry
Tomorrow is another day
You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holdin' an umbrella when the grey clouds come over again
Tryna find somethin' real, but it's not the game they play
Pretending that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Another "I, me, mine" to blur the lines
Between love and then heartbreak
Oh, it's a lonely life thinkin' you're right and always shiftin' blame
And every time it's getting more and more ugly
And that's why the photograph gets burned
Throw the match in gasoline, a-ayy
Don't let them tell you, "Keep it all inside"
I know the winds have got to change
You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holdin' an umbrella when the grey clouds come over again
Tryna find somethin' real, but it's not the game they play
Pretending that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And it seems like time can be so much more than a wake-up call
And live real life
Every day is a chance that we can start over, read my mind
There'll be ups and downs, but it won't change a thing between you and I
There's one thing I can't change
You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holdin' an umbrella when the grey clouds come over again
Tryna find somethin' real, but it's not the game they play
Pretending that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel
You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holdin' an umbrella when the grey clouds come over again
Tryna find somethin' real, but it's not the game they play
Pretending that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can't stop the rain, yeah, can't stop the rain, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can't stop the rain, can't stop the rain (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can't stop the rain (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know you can't stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
