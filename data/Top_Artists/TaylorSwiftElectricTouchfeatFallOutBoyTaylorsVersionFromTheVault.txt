Just breathe, just relax, it'll be okay
Just an hour 'til your car's in the driveway
Just the first time ever hanging out with you
Tonight
I've got my money on things goin' badly
Got a history of stories ending sadly
Still hoping that the fire won't burn me
Just one time, just one time
All I know is this could either break my heart
Or bring it back to life
Got a feelin' your electric touch
Could fill this ghost town up with life
And I want you now, wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch, mm-mm
I've been left in the rain, lost and pining
I'm tryin' hard not to look like I'm trying
'Cause every time I tried hard for love, it fell apart (oh-oh)
I've gotten used to no one callin' my phone
I've grown accustomed to sleepin' alone
Still, I know that all it takes is to get it right
Just one time, just one time
All I know is this could either break my heart
Or bring it back to life
Got a feelin' your electric touch
Could fill this ghost town up with life
And I want you now, wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch
♪
I was thinking just one time (just one time)
Maybe the stars align (just one time)
And maybe I call you mine
And you won't need space
Or string me along while you decide
And just one time (just one time)
Maybe the moment's right (the moment's right)
It's 8:05, and I see two headlights

All I know is this could either break my heart
