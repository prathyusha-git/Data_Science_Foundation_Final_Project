You're doin' somethin' to me, mm, you're doin' somethin' strange
Well, jump back, talk to me, woman
You make me wanna make a baby, baby
A supernatural woman, a supernatural freak
Don't know what you're doin', got me feelin' weak
Oh, I wanna call you fever, baby, you can set a fire on me
Hot damn, pop it like a pistol, mama
You got me down on my knees, begging "please"

I'm gunnin' for you, yeah
Locked, loaded, shoot my shot tonight
I'm comin', baby
I'm gunnin' for you
Pull my trigger, let me blow your-

Everybody's watchin', pretty little thing

Come closer, let's talk about it
You want white lines in a limousine
Whipped cream, and everything in between, yeah
I'm comin', baby

Locked, loaded, shoot my shot tonight
I'm comin', baby
I'm gunnin' for you
Pull my trigger, let me blow your-
