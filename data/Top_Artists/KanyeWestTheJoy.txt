Add a little sugar (ow), honeysuckle and (woo)
A great big expression of happiness
Boy, you couldn't miss (uh-huh, uh-huh)
With a dozen roses (ayy, uh, Mr. West)
Such would astound you (Pete Rock)
The joy of children laughing around you (uh)
These are all the makings of you (woo)
I do it for the forefathers, yeah, the street authors
That are now A&Rs in the cheap office
Rappers that never got signed, but they keep offers
Girls that's way too fine for us to keep off us
Gave her a handshake only for my man's sake
She in her birthday suit 'cause of the damn cake
Now it's crumbs all over the damn place (uh-huh)
And she want me to cum all over her damn face
I never understood Planned Parenthood
'Cause I never met nobody planned to be a parent in the hood
Taking refills of that Plan B pill
Another shorty that won't make it to the family will
If I don't make it, can't take it, hope the family will
They ain't crazy, they don't know how insanity feel
Don C. just had a shorty, so it's not that bad
But I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had
Add a little sugar (woo), honeysuckle and (come on)
A great big expression of happiness (ow)
Boy, you couldn't miss (uh-huh, uh)
With a dozen roses (ayy, Kanye, uh)
Such would astound you (Pete Rock)
The joy of children laughing around you (uh)
These are all the makings of you (yeah)
No electro, no metro
A little retro, ah, perfecto
You know the demo, your boy act wild
You ain't get the memo? Yeezy's back in style
Now one room got Gidget, the other got Bridget
What's more tripped out, dawg, is they sisters
Nah, you ain't listen, they Black, they sisters
They mama named 'em after white bitches
So next time you see me on your fallopian
Though the jewelry's Egyptian, know the hunger's Ethiopian
Stupid questions like, "Is he gon' be dope again?
Have you seen him? Has anybody spoke to him?"
This beat deserves Hennessy
A bad bitch, and a bag of weed, the Holy Trinity
In the mirror where I see my only enemy
Your life's cursed? Well, mine's an obscenity
Add a little sugar (woo), honeysuckle and (come on, red lights)
A great big expression of happiness (ow)
Boy, you couldn't miss (let that thing roll, uh-huh, uh)
With a dozen roses (ayy, Kanye, uh)
Such would astound you (Pete Rock, uh)
The joy of children laughing around you (uh)
These are all the makings of you (yeah, ow)
This is my mama's shit
I used to hear this through the walls in the hood when I was back on my pajama shit (uh-huh)
Afros and marijuana sticks (woo)
Seeds in the ganja had it poppin' like the sample that I'm rhymin' with
Pete Rock (uh), let the needle drop
I seen so much as a kid, they surprised I don't needle pop (uh-huh)
Takin' sips of Pop's six-pack of Miller nips
Pink Champale, Ballantine Ale
Ballys on my feet help me balance out well (woo)
That and the shit I used to balance on the scale
I got it honest from the parties from my mama's
Virgin Marys tried to judge her, I'm like, "Where are them Madonnas now?"
Give all glory to Gloria (one-two, okay)
They said you raised that boy too fast but you was raising a warrior
We victorious, they'll never take the joy from us, uh (one-two, okay)
Keep your hands up, get 'em high now (it's Pete Rock, Kanye)
Don't let them take your fire
Keep your hands up, get 'em high now (one-two, okay)
Don't let them take your fire
Keep your hands up, get 'em high now (it's Pete Rock, Kanye)
Don't let them take your fire
Keep your hands up, get 'em high now, yeah (one-two, okay)
It's Pete Rock, Kanye
One-two, okay
It's Pete Rock, Kanye
One-two, okay
It's Pete Rock, Kanye
One-two, okay
It's Pete Rock, Kanye
One-two, okay
