A lot of people ask me, am I afraid of death?
The truth is, I think what scares me the most
Is not being able to say all the things I wanna say to you
When I'm no longer here
So this song is for Hailie, for when that day comes
Where's Hailie? Where is she at?
This ain't Hailie
Who is it?
It's a monster
I've been waiting all night for the sunrise
To take away the dark sky
(You're the dad monster)
(And them are the baby monsters, and I'm the mom monster) (oh)
All it takes is a new day sometimes
To get me in a better state of mind
(Give me a kiss, monster, give me a kiss)
(Love you) (I love you)
If I could just fall asleep
I'd be lost in a dream
But right now, it's misery
And I just have to remember
That when a heart breaks, it ain't broken forever
The pieces will grow back together
And in time, I'll be fine
The tears are temporary
Yeah, so Hailie Jade, I wrote you this song
To help you cope with life now that I'm gone
How should I start? Just wanna say
Look after Alaina, Stevie, and Uncle Nate
And, sweetie, be strong, I know I was your rock
And I still am, saying goodbye is just not
Ever easy, but why you crying? Just stop
Hailie, baby, dry your eye, this is not forever
That when a heart breaks, it ain't broken forever
The pieces will grow back together
And in time, I'll be fine
The tears are temporary
Daddy (ooh)
What? (Ooh)
When I used to have this when I was a little kid (ooh)
Baby, are you okay? (Ooh)
Yeah, and you will get over me and move on
You can play me on repeat on a song
But don't you dare shed a tear, what I tell you?
"Straighten up, little soldier," them times when I held you
Jade, it'll be okay, baby, I'm here, hey
I'm watchin' you right now, baby girl, I vow
I will protect you, your guardian angel
As hard as this may feel, us parting is painful
And, darling, the rain will, drive you insane still
You will remain strong, Hailie, just hang on
It won't be too long, I need you to move on
And remember, it will get better
'Cause time heals and when a-
When a heart breaks, it ain't broken forever
The pieces will grow back together
And in time, I'll be fine
The tears are temporary
The bad days will start to get better
And we'll be laughin' together
And tonight, when I cry
The tears are temporary
I know this big girl (ooh)
And she's really pretty (ooh)
You know what her name is?
Hailie (ooh)
Hailie, how did you know? (Ooh)
'Cause-
Yeah, and if there's days where you
Wanna just lock yourself in your room and cry
Just think of how when you were little, how you and I
Back and forth to the studio, we used to drive
You strapped in the back seat, 'cause you were my
Little sidekick, yeah, sweetie, I know this hurts
Bean, I'm wishing your pain away
Remember this, Hailie Jade
There's gonna be rainy days
I promise you'll get through 'em and make it regardless
Fuck it, Jade, I'll be honest
I knew that you was gonna take this the hardest
Sweetie, get up, I know that this is breaking your heart
It's the hardest thing I've ever wrote (Daddy)
Hailie, sweetheart, it's okay for you to let me go
Baby, I promise you that when a-
That when a heart breaks, it ain't broken forever
The pieces will grow back together
And in time, I'll be fine
The tears are temporary
The bad days will start to get better
And we'll be laughin' together
And tonight when I cry
The tears are temporary
What's your favorite song? (Ooh)
My favorite song right now (ooh)
Mine and your favorite song
Mine and your favorite song? (Yeah, on the radio) (ooh)
I like this part
That's your favorite part, dad (ooh)
You're taping me, bitch
I got you on tape cussin'
Can you hear?
Yup
No, bitch
No, what?
No, I said, I said, "No, bitch"
Okay, no cussin'
