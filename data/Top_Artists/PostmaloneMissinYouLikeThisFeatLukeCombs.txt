I thought I'd think about you
Every now and then
When the rain falls down in Kansas
When I hear dust in the wind
When I told you I was leavin'
In that Exxon parking lot
I thought the world would keep on turnin'
No one told me it would stop
And I'da called you crazy
After we were through
If you'd-a told me that it'd take me
All my life to get over you
I knew for a night
Girl I'd be drinkin' bout you
But it's years gone by
And I'm still dreamin' 'bout you
Cross my heart til I die
I swear to God, I woulda
Never done what I did
If I knew that I'd be missin' you like this
♪
Wake up in the mornin'
In a bed with someone new
She don't know I still got pictures
In that box instead of boots
You're the whiskey in my coffee
The unanswered in my prayers
You're the reason I'm still lonely
Even when the next best thing is layin' right here
I knew for a night
Girl I'd be drinkin' bout you
But it's years gone by
And I'm still dreamin' 'bout you
Cross my heart til I die
I swear to God I woulda
Never done what I did
If I knew that I'd be missin' you like this

I'da called you crazy
After we were through
If you'd-a said they'd have to lay me
Six feet under just to get over you
I knew for a night
That I'd be drinkin' 'bout you
But it's years gone by
And I'm still dreamin' bout you
Cross my heart til I die
I swear to God I woulda
