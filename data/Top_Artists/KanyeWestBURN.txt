Her body like the wild, wild west
What if you don't bow down? Yeah
Ridin' in the wind, God bless
She's an inferno, it's a hell of a time
Burnin' like a candlelight
Your love is dangerous
Your love is, my love is, our love is
Burnin' like a candlelight
Your love is dangerous (are you not entertained?)
Your love is (are you not entertained?), my love is, our love is
Who's not entertained by my pain?
Who ain't cash a check off my name?
When my campaign turned to cam-pain
I burned eight billion to take off my chains
Burn, baby, burn
Sometimes it hurts, I guess I never learned
To who it may concern, the CEO of the firm
Is now somewhere smoking sherm with Big Worm
Man, a couple wrong turns could fry you forever, it's a permanent burn
You charging for cookie, that's bang for your buck
If you kissin' on the mouth, you ain't charging enough
You heard I was flyin' 'em out
They was tryin' for clout, I was dyin' of gout
Man, the world gone mad
Heard R. Kelly in the next Balenciaga ad
Burnin' like a candlelight (burn)
Your love is dangerous
Your love is, my love is, our love is
Burnin' like a candlelight
Your love is dangerous
Your love is, my love is, our love is
Her body like the wild, wild west
What if you don't bow down? Yeah
Ridin' in the wind, God bless
She's an inferno, it's a hell of a time
