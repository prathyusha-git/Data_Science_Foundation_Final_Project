(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(I'm paralyzed)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Let's go)
I see you drowning in the purple lights
Diamonds shining bright
I see every ice on you (on you)
You snatch my soul, I'm crucified
I feel paralyzed
I'm so mesmerized by you (by you)
But I know you're right for me, ecstasy
I keep coming back for more
I think that you would die for me, destiny
And this time, I know for sure
Just don't break my heart (don't break my heart)
Don't let me down, please
Don't you break my heart (don't break my heart)
I don't know if I can take it anymore
Take it anymore, take it anymore
I can't take another heartbreak or I'll end it all
And the girl I used to love, we broke up in the club
And I almost died in the discotheque (-theque)
Ooh, and now I know she wasn't right for me, enemy
I kept coming back for more
I'd rather you would die for me, destiny
And this time I know for sure
Just don't break my heart (don't break my heart)
Don't let me down, please
Don't you break my heart (don't break my heart)
I don't know if I can take it anymore
Don't break my heart (don't you, don't you)
I'm falling apart already
Don't you break my heart (don't you, don't you)
I don't know if I can take it anymore
I believe the liquor's talking
I just need the room to stop
And I could be the one you want
Just as long as you don't break my heart
(And I realized, when I kissed your neck)
(That the room is hot, I can taste your sweat)
(It's just you and I in the discotheque)
But don't you worry
Just don't break my heart (don't break my heart)
Don't let me down, please
Don't you break my heart (don't break my heart)
I don't know if I can take it anymore
Don't break my heart (don't you, don't you)
I'm falling apart already
Don't you break my heart (don't you, don't you)
I don't know if I can take it anymore
