Ohh ohh ehh
Once was a time you and I
Made a promise 'til the day we die
I trusted each and every word
Never thinking that I'd get burned
Silly me, I believed in your fairy tales
Boy, I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride, all the tears that I cried
And it cuts like a knife
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy, it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time
There's no time to give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye
♪
Fool me once, shame on you
Fool me twice, now this song is through
The things you said, I can never forget
The things you did fill my heart with regret
But I'm still standing tall as I walk away
And you know that it's true when you hear me say
It's over, it's through
Ain't a thing you can do, boy
It's sad, but it's true
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes (ever will deceive these eyes)
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy, it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
No, I'm never gonna hear your lies (hear your lies)
So listen while I make it clear (make it clear)
Incase you didn't hear
This time's the last time
There's no time to give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye

Cause I'm never gonna
Never gonna cry no more
