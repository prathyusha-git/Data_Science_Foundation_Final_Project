Your voice is music to my ears, I'm wide awake
Stuck on the way your frequencies resonate
You say that no matter what, you're watching over me
I knew when I first read your lips
Only angels speak like this
You encourage everyone without trying
All of your boundaries keep me in line
God is within us, what you're always saying
Your energy is enough to suffice
Your intentions are obvious
Your affection's miraculous
Every promise you make, you keep
Never met nobody else like this
Only angels speak like this
Your voice is music to my ears, I'm wide awake
Stuck on the way your frequencies resonate
You say that no matter what, you're watching over me
I knew when I first read your lips
Only angels speak like this
La-dee-da, da-da-dee-da
La-dee-da, la-dee-da
La-dee-da, da-da-dee-da
Dee-da, la-da
La-dee-da, da-da-dee-da
Dee-da, da-da
Only angels speak like this
The cadence you speak, it keeps us both in sync
The ocean we lay in makes it hard to think (ooh)
Our spirits combine and it's a basic instinct
Your love is free-spoken, not written in ink (oh-woah)
Your intention are obvious (obvious)
Your affection's miraculous (I cherish your touch)
Every promise you make, you keep (ooh)
Never met nobody else like this
Only angels speak like this
Your voice is music to my ears, I'm wide awake (I'm wide awake)
Stuck on the way your frequencies resonate (how they resonate)
You say that no matter what (no matter what)
You're watching over me (you're watching over me)
I knew when I first read your lips (your lips)
Only angels speak like this (like this)
La-dee-da, da-da-dee-da
La-dee-da, la-dee-da
La-dee-da, da-da-dee-da
Dee-da, da-da
La-dee-da, da-da-dee-da
Dee-da, da-da
