Kaleidoscope love, yeah, that is you and me
Forever changing, we make life interesting
Some days we're red, and some days we both think green
But I like the nights when we leave the canvas free
Grab a brush, and see where the feeling may lead
Nothing is out of our reach
Our words are mixing the pigment we need
Can we get started?
I keep falling
Deeper in dark blue
Brighter than white
Rainbows exploding
But I can't see nothing
Except you and your eyes
Maybe, we'll just paint the night colourblind
In every spectrum, we find the millionth piece
Connect the dots and everything in between, mmm
Dull in the moment, you'll turn it golden leaf
♪
You take the dark away, and that's no easy feat
♪
Pick an orange, watch the shade change in the heat
From yellow, purple, and green
Your words are mixing each pigment we need
Can we get started?
I keep falling
Deeper in dark blue
Brighter than white
Rainbows exploding
But I can't see nothing
Except you and your eyes
Maybe, we'll just paint the night colourblind
Mmm
Maybe, we'll just paint the night colourblind
