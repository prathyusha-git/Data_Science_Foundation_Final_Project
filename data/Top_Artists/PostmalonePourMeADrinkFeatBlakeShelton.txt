Forty hours got me goin' out my mind
Dallas dropped another game in overtime
Caught a ticket speedin' down the 65
You know where I'm goin'
Guess I really went and messed it up again
Now my baby's goner than a Tulsa wind
Judgin' by the stone sober state I'm in
Need to crack one
Wide open
Somebody pour me a drink
Somebody bum me a smoke
I'm 'bout to get on a buzz
I'm 'bout to get on a roll
Yeah I've been breakin' my back
Just keepin' up with the Joneses
Y'all know what I mean
Y'all know how it goes
When it's up on a Friday and I'm paid
Slide one over my way
I can't even think when
I can hear one calling my name
Somebody pour me a drink
Pour me a drink
Bourbon brown eyes tryna get me drunk
Ain't stoppin' 'til the bottle and the job is done
Hey I think I mighta found my future love
Buddy you should probably buy her one
Somebody pour me a drink
Somebody bum me a smoke
I'm 'bout to get on a buzz
I'm 'bout to get on a roll
Yeah I've been breakin' my back
Just keepin' up with the Joneses
Y'all know what I mean
Yeah, y'all know how it goes
When it's up on a Friday and I'm paid
Slide one over my way
I can't even think when
I can hear one calling my name
Somebody pour me a drink

Okay I've been breakin' my back
Just keepin' up with the Joneses
