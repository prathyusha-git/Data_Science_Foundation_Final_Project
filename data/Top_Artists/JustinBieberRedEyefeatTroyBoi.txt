Hoppin' on the red eye
Hoppin' on the red eye
I can rest assured knowing you're on the other end of it
Looking forward to the descent and then you're out
See you when I touch down
You're my champagne
You make me pop off everywhere like confetti (yeah)
I know it seems strange
I seen you last night and I miss you already (yeah)
My bed is depressed (depressed)
My pillow's a victim (hmm, hmm)
Got me in chills while my hands are sweaty (B-O-I)
And I gotta fly out
Hate you got me strung-out
And I gotta fly out
Hate you got me strung-out, oh-ooh
Only been ten hours but my sanity is gone
Hoppin' on the red eye
Hoppin' on the red eye (big bag, oh, big-big)
Hoppin' on the red eye (hey, big bag, big-big)
Hoppin' on the red eye (big bag, oh)
Got a new job, for a big bag
You better go get it
You'll be gone for a few days, posin' in the heat
I ain't gon' sweat it
I miss your distractions
My touch is in distress
You're just a plane ride away from my permanent visit
And I gotta fly out
Hate you got me strung-out
And I gotta fly out
Only been an hour, but I'm feelin' all alone
You should be hoppin' on the red eye (right now)
Hoppin' on the red eye (right away)
I can rest assured knowing you're on the other end of it
Looking forward to the descent and then you're out (ooh-woah, ooh-woah, oh)
See you when I touch down
(Hey)
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na, na-na, ah-ah (oh)
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na, na-na, ah-ah (hey)
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na, na-na, ah-ah
See you when I touch down
(Hey)
Big bag (oh)
Big-big
Big bag (hey)
Big-big
(T-R-O-Y-B-O-I, oh)
