Mhm, here we go strapping, we up
Never forget all the memories
Sitting, I sip out my cup
Thinking I should be a better me
Truly, I'm blessed from the start
So much to say in these melodies, oh
Stare at the sky, the moon singin' sweet
Oh my God, such a sweet moment
Angels, they say I'm not ever weak, such a lonely moment
Heaven knows I might never sleep, troublin' my soul
Hey, I've been praying, life can be draining, oh
Hey, we were late, tryna keep hauling on
I'm ashamed and yet, what I will see?
Ain't nobody knows, so I go
How can I get through? (Don't leave so soon)
How can I get through? (To the moon)
Early afternoon (I wanna go to the moon)
Take you to the moon (don't leave so soon) (whoa)
Don't leave so soon (how could I get through?) (Yeah)
How can I get through? (Ooh)
Early afternoon (I wanna go to the moon)
Take you to the moon (don't leave so soon) (ooh)
Don't leave so soon (how could I get through? How could I get through?)
Yeah-ayy
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh
