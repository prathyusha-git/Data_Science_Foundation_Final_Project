Gather 'round
I'm glad everybody came out tonight
As we stand on our neighborhood corner
Know that this fire that's burning represents the passion you have
Listen
Keisha, Tammy, come up front
I recognize all of you
Every creed and color
With that being said, fuck your ethnicity
You understand that?
We gon' talk about a lot of shit that concerns you, all of you
Now everybody, throw your hands up high
If you don't give a fuck, throw your hands up high
Throw your hands up high (hands up high)
Oh-ooh, oh
Oh-ooh, oh
Oh-ooh, oh
Now I don't give a fuck if you
Black, White, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga
Fire burning inside my eyes
This the music that saved my life
Y'all be calling it hip-hop, I be calling it hypnotize
Yeah, hypnotize, trapped my body but freed my mind
What the fuck is you fighting for?
Ain't nobody gonna win that war
My details be retail, man, I got so much in store
Racism is still alive, yellow tape and colored lines
Fuck that, nigga look at that line, it's so diverse
They getting off work and they wanna see Kendrick
Everybody can't drive Benz's, and I been there
So it make it my business, to give 'em my full attention, ten-hut
Man, I gotta get my wind up
Man, gotta get down with God 'cause I got my sins up, ooh
Matter of fact, don't mistake me for no fucking rapper
They sit backstage and hide behind them fucking cameras
I mosh pit, had a microphone, I tossed it
Had a brain, then I lost it
I'm out of my mind, so don't you mind how much the cost is
Penny for my thoughts, everybody, please hold up your wallets
Yeah, man, I'm the mailman, can't you tell, man?
Going postal, never freeze up when I approach you
That's starstruck and roast you, oh my
HiiPower
Reporting live from Planet Terminator X
I saw Martin Luther King with an AK-47
Now I don't give a fuck if you
Black, White, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga
I'm tired of y'all
'Cause everybody lie to y'all
And you believe it? Recognize them false achievements
It's treason and I'm Tylenol, I knock out when you knock it off
Knock on the doors of opportunity, I'm too involved
I'm no activist, I'm no Einstein before calculus
I was kicking that Math dropping that science
Like an alchemist, and I be kicking that ass
Lyrically, I'm UFC, if a UFO had came for me
I'ma come back with the head of an alien
Don't alienate, my dreams get it right, get a life, I got two
That's a metaphor for the big shit I do, boy
TMI, TSA, man, I'm fly
Put wings on my back
That a plane or angel? Both
Like a pilot with a halo, whoa
Gross
I mean, I've seen so many things come through them, him, her, you, mm, mm, mm, mm
I'm just a messenger, yeah, I know life's a bitch, get the best of her
Put them 3's up, they notice that we up
HiiiPower and the power in the people and if they don't believe us
They'll die
Wizard
Now I don't give a fuck if you
Black, White, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga
