Smokin' weed with you
'Cause you've taught me to
Every mornin' when I wake up, uh
Money on my mind, good time to get caked up, uh
Sunshine comin' through my blinds, I'm livin', but
Really though, it's never enough
Ten million, that's a must, livin' in California
Everybody wanna visit for women (weed and weather)
They come for (women, weed, and weather)
(For the women, weed, and weather)
From all around the world for (the women, weed, and weather)
These niggas'll kill fo' that, put it in yo' grill fo' that
Still, everybody gotta build fo' that, me? I make mill's off that
How the fuck y'all can't see I ride, when I drive, down the block, and you look outside
H-A-T-E in yo' eyes, I enter big money for the enterprise
It's a beautiful day, I guess, for a bitch to roll wit' Andre, I guess
Roll it up, baby, come and lift that dress, then roll it up for me when I'm stressed
You might catch me in Atlanta lookin' like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, Chi-Town I be really pimpin'
But nothin' like my hometown I'm forever livin'
(Women, weed, and weather)

What, what more can I say? W-Welcome to L.A
Uh, my nigga said he wanna fly out to get him some
Three W's only for a three-day run, bitch
Take them motherfuckin' panties off, you ain't no nun, shit
I be livin' in the sky every time I ride by them hoes
Ribbon in the sky on the radio, 'cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control, California livin' 'til I am old
You want to be on, to peak on the charts
So the peons can be gone, and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe, she in the Neon
'Cause she on the B.S. before we can start, uh
Fuck wit' a nigga, ride wit' a nigga
Let 'em know I'm priority, order me
Hennessey and for my niggas
OG Killa, call it Jason Voorhees
Boy he on his job, boy, he sure be havin' the marks on they mark
Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life, controllin' my vice
No way, hell no, uh-uh, if I'm wrong I don't wanna be right
We want to be on, to peak on the chart
So the peons can be gone, and pee on their hearts
Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault
That it's 82 degrees and my top peeled off
You might catch me in Atlanta, lookin' like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, Chi-Town I be really pimpin'

Uh, known for that homegrown where I come from
Smoke one, palm trees, double D's got 'em topless in the sun
I shall proceed, that's me, motherfuck your opinion
Huh, how many ways am I killin' 'em? Shit, right around a billion
We on it, that mean we livin' for the moment
That mean she'll fuck 'til the mornin', time and I got time
And I know that I'm in a position of
Controllin' anything out by that ocean
I'm a boss, I'll buy that ocean, ain't nobody fuckin' with this
They want that shit, they often fiend
I give it to 'em, but in between
My time, I gotta tie shoestrings
Life's a trip when you want these things
I often slip, and then I lean
Toward three W's in life
You know blow job need an application
Eatin' pussy make appetite
And, yeah, my type, I like 'em brown
Just like my drink, the fuck you think?
I don't fuck with no hand-me-downs
See, if you fuck then it's after me
You know how much I'ma make it work?
You know her dress? Slip it in her purse
When you discussed your love for lust
Just make sure you visit here first, Cali
