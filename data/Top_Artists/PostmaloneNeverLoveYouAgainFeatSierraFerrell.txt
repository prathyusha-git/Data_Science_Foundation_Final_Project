There's a bad moon hangin' over the city
I can't hear no hymns on the wind
As I pour up that glass of forget me
Hung over off what could've been
It's a long lost highway
And this road ain't my friend
I'll love you til tomorrow
Then I'll never love you again
Saw the bible on your dresser
Save some forgiveness for me
Baby this ain't no old cowboy western
Cuz I won't be lookin' back when I leave, oh
It's a long lost highway
And this road ain't my friend
I'll love you til tomorrow
Then I'll never love you again

It's a long lost highway
And this road ain't my friend
I'll love you til tomorrow
Then I'll never love you again
Girl I'll never love you
Again
