Sadness always finds an in
♪
Sneaks its way past, infecting everything
And every chapter has an end
But this is one momentous sequel, don't you think?
And the blackbirds, they fly
Like a frown on the skyline
Right now, I feel I'm running from the light
Engulfed in darkness, shielded from my eyes
One foot in, one out, I'm stuck on the borderline
Which way will I?
Guess I should take this on the chin
But I don't even know how all of this began
We are made to mold and bend
How can I wish for nothing when it's still a sin?
♪
And right now, I feel I'm running from the light
Engulfed in darkness, shielded from my eyes
One foot in, one out, I'm stuck on the borderline
Which way will I?
Tears never arrive, these ducts are dry
We are so blind
Waiting on the borderline
♪
Waiting on the borderline
♪
So, I will pour another drink
♪
And try to drown the pain with salt along the rim
And I'll shut off the things I think
'Cause nothing good will ever come from worrying

Right now, I feel I'm running from the light
