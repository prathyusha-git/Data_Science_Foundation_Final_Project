Man, why you doin' this?
'Cause you owe me
How?
'Cause I gave you everything
What?
And what did you do? You walked away from me
Yeah, but-
You too fuckin' blind to see I was good for you, I made you
You were nothin' 'til you found me
How many times you tried to kill me?
I always come back
You can't outgrow me, you can't out-think me
I'm all you got
