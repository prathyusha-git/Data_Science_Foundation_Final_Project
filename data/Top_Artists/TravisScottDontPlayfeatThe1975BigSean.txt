She was down when I dropped out of college
Down, she was down when I rode Impalas (slay)
Played with her pussy in the Jeep
Yeah, she was down with the foreplay drivin' (oh no)
Jumped in the car when she hit my digits
Don't want nothin', just to pull up at the projects (skrrt)
Easy to me my nigga
Villa with a scene, youngin' always seen with a killer (straight up)
Hand-stitched by my dealer
Dealing with a seam you ain't seen, what you mean Margiela? (La Flame)
Shit, he got the 'scripts for the cough
In the H gotta hit Johnny for the frost, swerved off
Ain't it been a minute since they seen a weird nigga from the corner put it on for the south?
On my momma, know a nigga be coasting
Go nigga, go nigga grab my bottles
Go nigga, go nigga grab my Chronic
Keep ya head up in the air my nigga

Bitch, don't you play me, don't you try me
I need the exact amount
Look at my face hoe, eye-to-eye me
I'm a boss, make sure you and your homies dress up, tight attire
When you see me hoe, or I'll take that white tee and tie-dye dye it
I mean, goddamn, nigga
You forgot where I came from? I'm from where you ain't from
Where you can't come, where it ain't none
Where these bitches is bitches and they ain't nuns
Where they hate from
But as soon as you blow they act like they been down since day one
Where there's fucking tank guns
But niggas never join the army, like it ain't one
If I ain't got it, then I'm huntin'
I'm either countin' or I'm cummin'
Swear, I just done bought that mansion
Treat that shit like it's a dungeon
Up at 5:00 a.m. still workin', but I treat it like it's one
I'm never actin' like I got it
Bitch, I'm actin' like I won it on these niggas
I ain't playin' with these niggas (swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve)

I ain't playing with, I ain't playing with these niggas (La Flame)
I ain't playing with these niggas
I ain't playing with, I ain't playing with these niggas

I ain't playing with, I ain't playing with these -
