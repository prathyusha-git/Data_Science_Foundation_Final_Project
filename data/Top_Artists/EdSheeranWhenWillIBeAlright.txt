Oh, I've been up all night
Thinkin' 'bout dyin'
I've just been wastin' time
When will I be alright?
♪
God is not on my side
But God knows I'm trying
I need to redefine
When will I be alright?
Listen to my heart beating
Why is there this empty feelin'?
Losing hope and all reason
When will I be alright?
♪
I have lived a rough life
Constantly fighting
Cheeks bruised and knuckles wiped
When will I be alright?
Hold my breath to stop breathing
Love, I used to know the meaning
I'd wake up if I was dreaming
But when will I be alright?
♪
I saw, now I am blind
To all the seasons
I see a fading light
When will I be alright?
Listen to my heart beating
Why is thеre this empty feeling?
Losing hope and all rеason
When will I be alright?
I tried my best to stop believing
I wonder about the arms she's in
This is it, the end is nearing
When will I be alright?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
