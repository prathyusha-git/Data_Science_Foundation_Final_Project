Oh, baby
Oh, Los Angeles I think I motherfucking die for you, yeah
I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through
I just can't say I don't love you (yeah)
'Cause I love you, yeah
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
But tonight, I'm gonna let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
You're scared to be lonely, especially in the night
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love
I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect and I know
You know the words, let's go, one, two, three, say
(Even though we're goin' through it)
(And it makes you feel alone)
(Just know that) I would die, for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind 'cause
Baby, I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
I would die for you, I would lie for you
Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, Los Angeles, oh baby
One more time
I would die for you, I would lie for you
Keep it real with you, I'd motherfucking kill for you, Los Angeles, yeah
One, two, one, two, three, sing
(Even though we're goin' through it)
(And it makes you feel alone)
Just know that I would die, for you
(Baby, I would die for you) yeah sing
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind 'cause
Baby, I would die for you
(Baby, I would die for you) yeah
One more time
Even though we're goin' through it
And it makes you feel, alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change, my mind 'cause
Baby, I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
