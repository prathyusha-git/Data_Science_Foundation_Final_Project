All alone
All alone
All alone
All alone
I got something to tell you but don't know how I'ma say it
I guess that I could only say one thing
Girl, I been bad again
Girl, I been bad again
'Cause with this money comes problems
And with these problems comes solutions
And I use 'em
When I'm faded I forget
Forget what you mean to me
Hope you know what you mean to me
(Pick up your phone)
The party's finished and I want you to know
(I'm all alone)
I'm feelin' everything before I got up
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
Poppin' again, I tried to quit again
I'm always tight with something I begin
That's why my niggas got me to the end
Supply what I take, I take what I spend, baby
I ain't lied to nobody but me
And you, and me
But you especially
(Pick up your phone)
The party's finished and I want you to know
(I'm all alone)
I'm feelin' everything before I got up
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down (When I'm coming down)
I always want you when I'm coming down
(Right down, right down, right down) I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down (ohhh)
I always want you when I'm coming down (ohhh)
I always want you when I'm coming down
(Right down) I always want you when I'm coming down
私を怒らせないで欲しい (Watashi o okorasenaide hoshii)
このようなことをされるのは不快だ (Konoyo na koto o sareruno wa fukainano)
士郎は卑怯です (Watashi no kako o shitte)
私のことを知って 何度も私の中に入ってくる (Nando mo watashi no naka ni haittekuru)
私の答えなど知っているはずなのに (Watashi no kotae nado shitteiru hazu nanoni)
私がもっと罪を重ねてきたことを あなたは知っていないの (Watashi ga something to tsumi wo kasanete kita koto o, anata wa shitte inai no)
