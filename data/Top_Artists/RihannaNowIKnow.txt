Hey, hmm, no
Took a chance
Rolled the dice on me and you
Opened up, let you in my world
Like a dance, started slow and then love took control
Swept away, so proud to be your girl
When you write a story much too fast
Sometimes a happy endin' doesn't last
Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it's not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
When it's wrong, you gotta let it go
Now I know

Remember when we said our love would last forever?
But then again, how are we to know?
There comes a time, that love will change like stormy weather
A sunny day will suddenly turn cold
Time will teach you all you need to learn
But there'll always be a first time you get burned
Oh, whoa
Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it's not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
When it's wrong, you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know
♪
I don't regret a single day
Joy and pain along the way
A broken heart's the price we pay
As sad as it may seem
Baby, can't you see?
It's the way it's gotta be
Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it's not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
When it's wrong, you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know
Yeah, no no
Now I know
