Your man on the road, he doin' promo
You said, "Keep our business on the low-low"
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it, but your friends know
I only call you when it's (half-past five)
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up
You say one, two, three
(I only call you when it's half-past five)
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up (that's the real me), when I'm fucked up
So I said
Hills have eyes, these hills have eyes
♪
Only you (to judge?)
(Only you to judge?)
I said, hide your lies, girl, hide your lies
One time
(Only you to trust)
Los Angeles!
(I only call you when it's half-past five)
(The only time that I'll be by your side)
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up (that's the real me, when I'm fucked up that's the real me)
I said, one, two, three
(I only call you when it's half-past five)
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up (that's the real me), when I'm fucked up (that's the real me, bae)
