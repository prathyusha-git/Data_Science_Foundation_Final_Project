I'ma put you down
(PYD, PYD, PYD)
Down (PYD, PYD, PYD)
I'ma put you down (PYD, PYD, PYD)
All the way down, ooh
From the door to the wall
Coffee table, girl, get ready
I'ma put you down (PYD, PYD, PYD)
All the way down (PYD, PYD, PYD)
From the stove to the counter top
Dining room table, are you ready?
I'ma put you down
(PYD, PYD, PYD) Oooh
(PYD, PYD, PYD)
Up the stairs to my bedroom
Light a few candles, b-brace yourself
I'ma put you down (PYD, PYD, PYD)
All the way down (PYD, PYD, PYD)
On a plane, a train, an automobile, doesn't matter
I'ma put you down (PYD, PYD, PYD)
All the way down (PYD, PYD, PYD)
And it don't make no sense to be that bad
I'ma take it out on you, babe (PYD, PYD, PYD)
Put you down (PYD, PYD, PYD)
This will show you how much I love you
For my appreciation
I'm a put you down (PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD)
Ooh, 'cause you deserve the best
And nothing but the best
So I give you the best you've ever had
I'ma put you down (PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD)
I'ma put you down
On the roof, balcony, we don't care who sees
Girl, I'ma put you down (PYD, PYD, PYD)
And all the way down, down, down (PYD, PYD, PYD)
After the club, in the parking lot
I don't care, anywhere, who could pick the spot, whatever
I'ma put you down, yeah (PYD, PYD, PYD)
And all the way down, yeah (PYD, PYD, PYD)
'Cause I've been doing forensics
On your body in this club
Now I can tell the way you walk
Your body ain't been touched the right way
It seems your man been treating you like a step child
Sub 'em out, sub me in
And I'ma get on the floor
And shut the whole game down
Until I hear you cheering, babe
Have you spelling out my name, babe
See, I wanna give my love
Be your dope man in the bedroom
You can make me your drug, babe
And it don't make no sense to be that bad
Oh no, baby (PYD, PYD, PYD)
I'm gonna put you down
Gonna show you how much I love you
For my appreciation, yeah, no-ooh (PYD, PYD, PYD)
(PYD, PYD, PYD)
Ooh, 'cause you deserve the best
And nothing but the best
So I'll give you the best you've ever had
I'm gonna put you down (PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD)
I'm gonna put you down, all the way down
Ooh, 'cause you deserve the best
And nothing but the best
So I give you the best you've ever had
I'ma put you down (I'ma put you down, girl, I'ma put you down, yeah)
I'ma put you down (I'ma put you down, yeah)
(No time but I'ma put you down)
Put you down, put you down, put you down, put you down, down
Put you down, put you down, put you down, put you down, down
I'ma put you down (I'ma put you down)
Put you down, put you down, put you down, put you down, down
All the way down
Put you down, put you down, put you down, put you down, down
(PYD, PYD, PYD)
(PYD, PYD, PYD)
I'ma put you down
(PYD, PYD, PYD)
