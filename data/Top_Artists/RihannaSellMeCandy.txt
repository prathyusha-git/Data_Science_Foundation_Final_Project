Sell me candy like the summer when it's meltin' in my hands
I know you're around like the ice cream man
I can hear you callin' whisper something in my ear
Sweet like sugar tell me what I wanna hear
I'm weak by your touch and when it's meltin' on my lips
A rush through my body, feel it in my fingertips
You selling me your fantasy that I wanna explore
Sound so good, spoil me rotten to the core, you know
Talk to me, take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It's destiny, just let it be
Of the words you speak, baby, sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
What's the charge? What's the cost?
(Come to daddy) you the boss
Be a professional, boy, you make a sale
I try to resist but every time I fail
The one temptation that I gotta endure
You're running through my garden
Now you're knocking at my door
Forbidden little kiss and you call it bittersweet
The shawty that you rocking with ain't nothin' like me
You selling me your fantasy that I wanna explore
Sound so good, spoil me rotten to the core, you know
Talk to me, take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It's destiny, just let it be
Of the words you speak, baby, sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
What's the charge? What's the cost?
(Come to daddy) you the boss
I want you, babe, more than you know
But don't you leave and don't you go
I want it all until time falls
These arms won't hold you wrong
I want your love, give you my trust
I wanna live for both of us
I wanna breathe ya, lay on your shoulder
I wanna warm ya when nights get colder
I want love, love, love
I want love, love, love
Talk to me, take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It's destiny, just let it be
Of the words you speak, baby, sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
What's the charge? What's the cost?
(Come to daddy) you the boss
