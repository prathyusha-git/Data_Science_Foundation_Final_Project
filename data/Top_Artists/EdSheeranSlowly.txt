One, two, three, four
You packed your bags and booked a plane
The taxi's taking you away
I know it's just a couple days
A second without you is pain
Maybe I'm just a fool who loves you
When you're here, it's a sunny place
But when you're gone, I can't explain
How everything seems to turn to grey
Even food just loses taste
Maybe I'm just a fool who loves you
When we are saying goodbye, you ask me, will I miss you?
Well, I just can't lie, I just can't lie
I'm dyin' alive every time that you leave
'Cause a life without you is not one I want to live
Kill me slowly, kill me slowly
Though I'll see you again, that don't mean it don't sting
This is knife-in-the-heart love that we've fallen in
Kill me slowly, kill me slowly
The scent of you on the pillowcase
The photo wall that has never changed
Sat on our bed in our little place
I'm still countin' down the days
Maybe I'm just a fool who loves you
Memories are all I got here
Until you call
Or whenever I hear your voice
Like you're in this room
And maybe I'm just a fool who loves you
When we are saying goodbye, you ask me, will I miss you?
Well, I just can't lie, I just can't lie
I'm dyin' alive every time that you leave
'Cause a life without you is not one I want to live
Kill me slowly, kill me slowly
Though I'll see you again, that don't mean it don't sting
This is knife-in-the-heart love that we've fallen in
Kill me slowly, kill me slowly
Ooh, ooh-ooh (kill me slowly, kill me slowly)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (kill me slowly, kill me slowly)
Kill me slowly (kill me slowly, kill me slowly)
Kill me slowly
Oh, I'm dyin' alive every time that you leave
'Cause a life without you's not one I want to live
Kill me slowly
