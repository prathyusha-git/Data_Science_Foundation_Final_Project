And I know I'm due for a billion-dollar advance (uh-huh)
I can see the future, I can see the future (I can see the future)
I can see the future, it's lookin' like we leveled through the sky
I can't wait to live in glory in eternal lastin' life (livin' in glory)

Seein' every angle, I can see through ya, yeah (yeah)
I can see the future, it's lookin' like we leveled through the sky (see enough)

Flyest on the Earth, so I had to name myself a planet (Pluto)
Automatic dead when you goin' against my family
Few breakups went public, I just bought another baddie (bought another baddie)
Bitch knew I was toxic, when she met me, I was a savage (met me, I was a savage)
High in the hills tryna avoid any madness (yeah)
Private on the Lear, this just like we imagined
Only settlin' for this Hi-Tech 'cause I ain't got the Actavis (yeah)
I'm tryna be modest (yeah), it sound like I'm braggin' (braggin')

To the trumpets, do you like the way it sounds?
I can't get enough, told you I just want it all
I can't get enough, you ain't been doin' enough (do you like the way it sounds?)
So cold, so cold
It's so cold, so cold, so cold
You could see the future, there's a sparkle in your eye
Why you all up on my thigh? Can't let you
Niggas plottin' my demise, I got murder on my mind
I got money on the line, I can't lose if I tried
Let no bitch break my stride
Chosen, I'm gon' bet on me
Chosen, all my shit antique
Frozen, I can't feel no heat
Diamonds dancing on me
You startin' afresh, man, you fell out of pocket
You fucked that girl that you met at the party
I got some new niggas down in the lobby
How can I sleep when you're out catchin' bodies?
I still wanna be with you, trust me, I know that's insane
I'd rather fuck on you than fuck on lames
I did some shit in Berlin, I'm OD
We both ain't shit and it's workin' for me
Workin' for me, yeah
