I put a sunglass on, so I don't have to say hi (hi)
Send a text after I'm gone, I don't say goodbye (bye)
And my Miss USA called for a ride (ride)
She filled my tank, I didn't spend a dime (dime)
And I don't mind at all
And I don't cry
Ask me how I feel, I'm dynamite
And it goes like
I'm not here for long, my baby
I'm just passing by
The world keeps getting hotter, baby
But I'm too cool to die
She wanna fuck me on a jet
But I'm scared to fly (fly)
She wanna feed me fancy drinks
And keep me up all night (night)
She asked me if I like this wedding ring
For fuck's sake, it's our first date
I did, and then I went and bought it on the next date
Fits me great, uh
And I don't mind at all
And I don't cry (I don't cry, don't cry)
Ask me how I feel, I'm dynamite
And it goes like
I'm not here for long, my baby
I'm just passing by (passing by)
The world keeps getting hotter, baby
But I'm too cool to die (I'm too cool, I'm too cool)
I'm not here for long, my baby
I'm just passing by (I'm just passing by)
The world keeps getting hotter, baby
But I'm too cool to die (I'm too cool to die)
