I'm a half-read story, I was fine on the shelf
Why did you take me down as if I needed your help?
No prior warning, no one to catch when I fell
Now that you're not around, I'm not doing so well
Do I look like a monster underneath all my skin?
I wanna cut all this open 'til I'm feeling something
Now I'm chasing the cracks, so I can let the light in
I'm in love with the ghost of you
Better luck next year, there's nothin' left here
Why am I constantly searching, feeling unsettled?
Living in Hell, pretending it's Heaven
Head spin, maybe I'm destined to be
Always lonely, alone, a loser, pathetic
Maybe tomorrow all will be better

I'm a half-read story, better off in the fire
Now I feel like the fool, haunted by design
For a moment of glory, I would risk all I am
I look at what we had and I don't understand
Do I look like a monster underneath all my skin?
I wanna cut all this open 'til I'm feeling something
Now I'm chasing the cracks 'til I can let the light in
I'm in love with the ghost of you
Better luck next year, there's nothin' left here
Why am I constantly searching, feeling unsettled?
Living in Hell pretending it's Heaven
Head spin, maybe I'm destined to be
Always lonely, alone, a loser, pathetic
Maybe tomorrow all will be better
