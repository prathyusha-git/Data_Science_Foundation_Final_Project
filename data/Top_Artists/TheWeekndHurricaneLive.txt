See this in 3D
All lights out for me
All lights out for me
Lightning strikes the beach
80 degrees
Warm it up for me
Finally free
Found the God in me
As I go out to the sea
I can walk on water
Thousand miles from shore
Demons talk on my shoulders
Father, hold me close
Don't let me drown
I know you won't
