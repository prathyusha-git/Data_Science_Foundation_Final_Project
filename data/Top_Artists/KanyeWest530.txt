Baby, yeah
Whoa, baby, who pick up when you call?
Yeah, yeah
5:30, the car missin'
No text backs or call misses, I feel like we all victims
Nights be gettin' long
Drunk textin', I should not do Patrón
I hop on the phone, turn the music up, got in my zone
Drunk textin', I should probably sue Patrón
Had to do wrong order to do you right
You gotta go through it order to give advice
It's the price of the litty nights, I know the liquor hittin'
Why when somebody break your heart, it help fix your vision?
If you fall in love with a demon or a diva
Pray your soulmate got a soul when you meet her
The crystal ball couldn't tell me if they'll leave again
Problems too extra large to share with a medium
We fight not for flesh and blood on this level
And devil's advocate is advocatin' for the devil
And love is all drainin' and, stop, it's all fadin'
We used to be secretive, but now it's all blatant
It's all just lost, ain't it? Watchin' it all cave in
We the topic of conversation
5:30, the car missin'
No textin', just call missin'
We fight and you won't listen
You right, we both trippin'
It's game time, matter of fact, it's Ye time
The past year been a strange time
Visitations on FaceTime
And who gon' break whose heart first? Always just breaks mine
Looking for blessings that God'll hand me
I'm tryna just raise the family, somebody should raise the nanny
I'm tryna leave you alone
But that last text was courtesy of Patrón
5:30, the car missin'
Emotions is all distant
No texts, just calls missin'
We fight and you won't listen
You right, we both trippin'
Barely holdin' on
♪
Barely holdin' on, oh
Barely holdin' on
I'm barely holdin' on
5:30, the car missin'
Is this what you call distance?
Throwing stones at a glass prison
Cuss me out at our last visit
Mad dizzy, we drunk, past limit
You trippin' in public, that's bad business
We crash out, but you callin' it passionate
You bought the whole thing, but you scream when I'm laughin'
And we too much for us, everybody except for us
I don't know what's left of us, why the Devil keep testin' us?
Tryna right what's left of us, tryna right what's left of us
This the wire connecting us, I agree with the Reddit subs
Everything they read, it was, everything they said it was
Number one, you bet it was, better not forget it was
Either way, we get enough
You know it was, you know it is, you know the kid
You know we did and we showed it
Ten-ten, there's a hot chance she gon' go with it, she gon' fuck with it
Sit beside, I'ma go again, I'ma break the walls, we be goin' in
Pom-pom, yeah, the old man got 'em foldin' up
Got him screamin' "I can't take it, I can't take it"
You a fake bitch
You don't really love Ye, go listen to Drake, bitch
You ain't really dedicated like a tank, bitch
Go listen to Lil Baby, go listen to Future, bitch
First off, you don't think about your future, bitch
Your fault, what you thought, that we was new to this?
Hunnid miles on it, what I'm supposed to do with this?
(Hunnid miles on it, what I'm supposed to do with this?)
You won't turn the rappers down, you always say "yes"
You don't really love Ye, go listen to Drake, bitch
You don't love Dolla $ign, listen to Luther, bitch
Listen to Lil Baby, listen to Future, bitch
I hope your future baby daddy is a fugitive
Can't sue CO, I don't never love these hoes
You don't love Ye, you love Moneybagg Yo
(You don't love Ye, you love Moneybagg Yo)
What he mad for?
You a fake bitch
Go listen to Abel, better yet, listen to Drake, bitch
Listen to Lil Baby, go listen to Future, bitch
(Listen to Lil Baby, go listen to Future, bitch)
And I hope your baby daddy was a fugitive
And he leaves your ass right there where you used to live
Don't go blamin' me, I'on got nothin' to do with this
Them last words were Patrón
That last text was Patrón
I'm three-four drinks past drunk
I might not make it home
