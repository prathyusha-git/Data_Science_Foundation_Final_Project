She said she leavin' her boyfriend
She wanna meet me at a Ritz-Carlton
She lookin' pretty, she lookin' gorgeous
We makin' love, but we heartless
She want ass-shots (shots), give her face-shots (face)
Back of the Maybach ('Bach), your ho get slayed, yah
Tryna get saved, yah, who am I to hate? Yah
I just wanna get paid, give my ho a bre-a-a-a-a-ak
I do gravity above the stars, goin' to Mars when I flow
Can't be trippin' off that money, baby, let a nigga go
Gotta get used to this type of service, travelin' through the back door
I just put a bitch on, bought another nigga ho
I just put your bitch on another bitch and hit 'em both
All a sudden, he a friend when I send that bitch a toast
When she want attention, she disguise it as a post
I forgot to mention, she was mine before she yours
She gon' need the coochie like she cake (cake)
All we do is fuck, we don't go on dates
I know some young throat GOATs in LA
She just wanna pop a pill and go to space (ay)
I do gravity above the stars, goin' to Mars when I flow
Can't be trippin' off that money, baby, let a nigga go
Gotta get used to this type of service, travelin' through the back door
I just put a bitch on, bought another nigga ho
When you bring your thot friends, you let everybody know
When you said you're not friends, you let everybody go
Baby girl, hop in, we goin' everywhere but broke
Like we always do at this-
She gon' eat the coochie for promotion
Knock that thing loosely, now she woke
I just kick the cookie out the dough
I'm in all Coogi, it ain't my fault
She gon' eat the coochie for promotion
Knock that thing loosely, now she woke
I just kick the cookie out the dough
I'm in all Coogi, it ain't my fault
She said she leavin' her boyfriend
She wanna meet me at a Ritz-Carlton
She lookin' pretty, she lookin' gorgeous (gorgeous)
We makin' love, but we heartless
Like we always do, like, like we always
Like, like we always do at this time
Like we always do, huh, like we always
Like we always do at this-
Like we always, like, like we always
Like we always do at this-
