Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the ra-aag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get impaled when I tell 'em "stick it"
So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shoutout to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of the MCin' mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch!
Been public enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch!
(Kick your shoes off)
(Let your hair down and)
(Go berzerk)
All night long
(Grow your beard out)
(Just weird out and)
(Go berzerk)
All night long
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'till the AM
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go
Let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (go berzerk), move your body
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes, crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's bangin', jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yes, siree Bob, I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw-wit-da-baw, dang dang
Pow-p-p-p-pow chica pow chica wow, wow
Got your gal blowin' up a val-v-v-v-val-valve
Ain't slowin' down, throw in the towel-t-t-towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh huh, how how
Least I know that I don't know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho...

So turn the volume loud, cause it's gonna mayhem 'till the AM
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go
Let yourself go

So everybody, everybody, (go berzerk), move your body
Everybody...

And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian. Lamar, oh sorry, yo
We done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock future into tomorrow
And girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you a-loan (car note)
Oh!
Marshall mathers shit head with a potty mouth
Get the bar of soap lathered Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl you're fixin' to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain baby
I ain't called anybody baby since birdman
Unless you're a swallow
Word, Rick, word man. You heard but don't get discouraged
Girl, this is your jam, unless you got toe jam
