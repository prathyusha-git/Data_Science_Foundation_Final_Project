Across the sea
By the Tennessee skyline
They told me I'd find
My hopes and my dreams
But I long to be
In the bed of my true love
Back where I came from
She's waitin' for me
So, I'll make my way
Through long windin' country roads
But my heart still beats
For my home and my English rose
I told my dad
On the phone it's amazing
From the straight to the craziest
These places I've seen
But I long to be
In the arms of my true love
Like he loves my mother
He understands me
I'll spend my days
Just travelling and playing shows
But my heart still beats
For my home and my English rose
♪
I met a man
In a bar down in Memphis
He told me he went there
To follow his dreams
He told me, "Son
You know I lost my true love
For the same exact reason
That you crossed the sea"
And I found truth
In people I barely know
But my heart still beats
For my home and my English rose
Oh, my heart still beats
For my home and my English rose
Oh, my heart still beats
For my home and my English rose
