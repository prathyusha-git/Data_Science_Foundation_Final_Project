There's still so far to go and I can't feel my toes
When the rain soaks through the heels and slips to the sole
Yeah, the blades are two feet tall, I wade in green, I'm movin' forward
To where? God only knows
Feel the wind's harsh refrain, like the clouds gripped my face
Saying, "It's alright to run from all this pain"
Oh, and when it's time to go, with one last breath that's in my lungs
I'll scream, "It's all for love," I'll scream, "It's all for love"
Come and kiss me, salt water
Oh, finally, I feel, at three or four degrees
I'm free in salt water
Embrace the deep and leave everything
It was just a dream
I can see it, up ahead, where the sky meets the ground
After that, there's only moving grey
I am filled up with regret with things I did or never said
Just leave that well alone
And come kiss me, salt water
Oh, finally, I feel, at three or four degrees
I'm free in salt water
Embrace the deep and leave everything
It was just a dream (ah-ah)
It was just a dream
♪
It was just a dream (ah-ah)
It was just a dream, was it just a dream?
Now I'm standing on the edge, gazing into Hell
Or is it somethin' else? I just can't tell
When there's nothin' left, I'll close my eyes and take one step
And say, "Well, here it goes," I'll say, "Well, here it goes"
Come and kiss me, salt water
Oh, finally, I feel, at three or four degrees
I'm free in salt water
Embrace the deep and leave everything
It was just a dream
