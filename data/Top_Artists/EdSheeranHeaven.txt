Heaven
Whenever I'm near you, I'm in heaven
The world could separate us if we let it
But we're better than we've ever been
Never
Doubted we could sail through stormy weather
We went through the furnace, burned together
And clay turned into porcelain
Suddenly everything's frozen
Caught in the spell of this moment
Just hold me in your arms
Dance with me and sway
As the sun closes on
A beautiful day
I can see you now
Though so much has changed
I'm falling in love
All over again
Silence
There is so much said inside this silence
Some things just can't be explained by science
The energy I feel for you
Higher
Every peak we reach, we just climb higher
Held up by the force of our desire
So let's pause and just take in this view
Chemicals bursting, exploding
As every second's unfolding
Just hold me in your arms
Dance with me and sway
As the sun closes on
A beautiful day
I can see you now
Though so much has changed
I'm falling in love
All over again
In love all over again
Falling in love all over again
Falling in love all over again
Falling in love all over again
Falling in love all over again
Falling in love all over again
Falling in love all over again
Falling in love all over again
Falling
Hold me in your arms
Dance with me and sway
As the sun closes on
A beautiful day
I can see you now
Though so much has changed
I'm falling in love
All over again
In love all over again
Falling in love all over again (and I'm falling, falling, falling in love)
Falling in love all over again (and I'm falling in love all over again)
Falling in love all over again
In love all over again (and I fall in love all over again)
Falling in love all over again
Falling in love all over again (I'm falling in love)
Falling in love all over again (all over again)
In love all over again
In love all over again
In love all over again
In love all over again
In love all over again
In love all over again
In love all over again
