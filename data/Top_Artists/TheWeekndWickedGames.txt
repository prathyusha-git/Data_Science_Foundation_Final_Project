Woah, woah, yeah
I left my girl back home
I don't love her no more
And she'll never fucking know that
These fucking eyes that I'm staring at
Let me see that ass
Look at all this cash
And I emptied out my cards too
Now I'm fucking leaning on that
Bring your love, baby, I could bring my shame
Bring the drugs, baby, I could bring my pain
I got my heart right here
I got my scars right here
Bring the cups, baby, I could bring the drank
Bring your body, baby, I could bring you fame
And that's my motherfucking words too
Just let me motherfucking love you
Listen, ma, I'll give you all I got
Get me off of this
I need confidence in myself (yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah)
Oh, listen, ma, I'll give you all of me
Give me all of it, I need all of it to myself (woah, woah)
So tell me you love me (only for tonight, only for the night)
Even though you don't love me (oh, oh)
Just tell me you love me (I'll give you what I need, I'll give you all of me)
Even though you don't love me (oh, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah)
Let me see you dance
I love to watch you dance
Take you down another level
And get you dancing with the Devil
Take a shot of this
But I'm warning you
I'm on that shit that you can't smell, baby
So, put down your perfume
Bring your love, baby, I could bring my shame
Bring the drugs, baby, I could bring my pain
Oh, I got my heart right here
Oh, I got my scars right here
Bring the cups, baby, I could bring the drank
Bring your body, baby, I could bring you fame
And that's my motherfucking words too, yeah
So let me motherfucking love you
Listen, ma, I'll give you all I got
Get me off of this (off of this)
I need confidence in myself (confidence)
Oh, yeah, yeah
Listen, ma, I'll give you all of me
Give me all of it, I need all of it to myself (I need all of it)
So tell me you love me, yeah (only for tonight, only for the night)
Even though you don't love me (oh, oh)
Just tell me you love me (I'll give you what I need, I'll give you all of me)
Even though you don't love me (oh, oh)
Oh
