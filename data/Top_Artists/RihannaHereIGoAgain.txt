It's been a minute since I saw you boy
Must admit it's good to hear your voice (hear your voice)
And I guess that I forgot just how
You make me feel when you're around
See you haven't lost your sense of style
And you still could melt me with your smile
Can't deny that I still got these feelin' deep inside (uhh)
It's funny how things could change
But still remain the same (uhh)
Isn't love just a crazy game?
Baby, here I go again
I look into your eyes and then
My heart remembers when
And I realize I've never gotten over you
Every time I hear your name
It's like the sunshine through the rain
And I realize it's happenin'
Baby, here I go again
♪
Here I go again
♪
Still remember how you make me weak
How I fought to find the words to speak (words to speak)
I just can't escape the memories
I tried but I just can't break free
Thought I closed the door on what we had
But these feelings just keep comin' back
Didn't think that you could
Make me lose control like that (uhh)
It's funny how things could change
But still remain the same (uhh)
Isn't love just a crazy game?
Baby, here I go again
I look into your eyes and then (baby)
My heart remembers when (my heart remembers when)
And I realize I've never gotten over you (oh I never)
Every time I hear your name (every time)
It's like the sunshine through the rain (the rain, no, no)
And I realize it's happenin'
Baby, here I go again (baby, here I go again)
Oh
(Here I go again baby)
Oh

Without a doubt yuh want to spend
And to experience it again
Because yuh love the way yuh felt back then
So make me light it up again
Reignite the flames again
'Cause you really miss dem days
When we used to chill up on the hill (used to chill)
Watch the sun set in West Nigril (west Nigril)
Girl, yuh bajan beauty

Not to mention the way you are within
It's funny how things could change
But still remain the same (uhh)
Isn't love just a crazy game?
Baby, here I go again
I look into your eyes and then
My heart remembers when (my heart remembers when)
And I realize I've never gotten over you (I never gotten over you)
Every time I hear your name
It's like the sunshine through the rain
And I realize it's happening

No matter what to do
We belong together
