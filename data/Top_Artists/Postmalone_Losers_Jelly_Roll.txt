Last callers, last chancers
9 to 5ers, truckers, dancers
Couple Chuck's, Ern's, and Chandler's
With a whole lot of prayers unanswered
Whiskey by noon, and beer before that
Southbound train on a hellbound track
Might just put two middle fingers up
And throw one back for all the people who ain't never felt at home
♪
Just spinnin' on a rock and gettin' stoned
Yeah, this one's for the losers
The outcasts and the sinners
The ain't never been no winners
Let's hear it for the Losers
Ain't got nowhere to fit in
There's a place you can always get in, oh
You might be lonely, but you're never alone
You're right here where you're supposed to be
Right here with all the Losers
The ones like you
And the ones like me
My therapist is a good bartender
Heart breakers and two month benders
Bad times that we can't forget
Good times that we won't remember
Raise 'em up when we hear a sad song
Love the cry of the steel guitar
No way to change the way we are
This one's for the Losers
The outcasts and the sinners
The ain't-never-been-no-winners
Let's hear it for the losers
Ain't got nowhere to fit in
There's a place you can always get in (oh, oh)
You might be lonely, but you're never alone
You're right here where you're supposed to be
Right here with all the losers
The ones like you
And the ones like me
If you're livin' like you got nothin' to lose
There's a spot for you beside me on this stool
Come kick it with the Losers (oh)
The outcasts and the sinners
The ain't never been no winners
Let's hear it for the Losers
Ain't got nowhere to fit in
