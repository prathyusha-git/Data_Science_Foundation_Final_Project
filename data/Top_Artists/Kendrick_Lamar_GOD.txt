This what God feel like, huh, yeah
Laughing to the bank like, "ah-ha," huh, yeah
Flex on swole like, "ah-ha," huh, yeah
You feel some type of way then, ah-ha, huh, yeah
(A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)
Ever since a young man (since a young man)
All I want to be was a gunman (was a gunman)
Shootin' up the charts, better run man
Y'all gotta see that I won, man
Slick as El DeBarge with the finger waves, work it, JT
Handle bars like a fade, watch me, work it, JT
I'm at large, running plays like a circuit, JT
I'm selling verses, JT, watch me work it, JT
Look, look, hold up
Don't judge me, my mama caught me with a strap
Don't judge me, I was young, fucking all the brats
Don't judge me, aimin' at your head for a stack
Don't judge me, don't judge me
Now, my home got a Valley peak
Don't judge me, if I press your line, you're a freak
Don't judge me, won't you tell a friend? Y'all gon' see
This what God feel like, huh, yeah
Laughing to the bank like, "ah-ha," huh, yeah
Flex on swole like, "ah-ha," huh, yeah
You feel some type of way then, ah-ha, huh, yeah
(A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)
Fuck is you talking to?
Aye, do you know who you're talking to?
Slide on you like fallen drapes
God toss full of carnivals
I kill 'em with kindness
Or I kill 'em with diamonds
Or I put up like fifteen hundred
Get your ass killed by the finest
Everything life is a gamble
Nothing in life I can't handle
Seen it all, done it all, felt pain more
For the cars, I done put blood on sword
Everything I do is to embrace y'all
Everything I write is a damn eight-ball
Everything I touch is a damn gold mine
Everything I say is from an angel
I don't rush shit, fuck shit
Always your shit, my shit
Cannonballs to ignite shit
Morning to the night shift, I'm on
I ain't sorry for it, ask for a piece of mine
You charged me for it
I wanna see sometimes if you ignore it
I'm in the streets sometimes and can't afford it
I got a bad habit, levitate, ducking haters
Oh my, my heart is rich, my heart is famous
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
This what God feel like, huh, yeah (this what God feel like)
Laughing to the bank like, "ah-ha," (this what God feel like) (uh)
Yeah (this what God feel like)
Flex on swole like, "ah-ha," (this what God feel like) (uh)
Yeah (this what God feel like)
You feel some type of way then (ah-ha) (this what God feel like), uh, yeah
This what God feel like
This what God feel like
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
