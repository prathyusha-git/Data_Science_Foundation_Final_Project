Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving but I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked we were talking and I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window, I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believing I don't always have to be alone
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmh, I can't help myself
Mmh, mmh, mh, ho no

Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling so I've got some things to say to you
(Ha) I've seen it all, so I thought that I'd never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmh, I can't help myself
Mmh, mmh, mh, mh

They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine
Hey Stephen, I could give you 50 reasons why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful but would they write a song for you? (Ha ha)
I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmh, I can't help myself
If you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmh, I can't help myself (han, han)
Myself
Mmh, mmh, mh, mh, I can't help myself, I can't help myself
Oh, oh, oh
