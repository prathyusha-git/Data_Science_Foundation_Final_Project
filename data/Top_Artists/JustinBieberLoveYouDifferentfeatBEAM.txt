I will, love you, different
Just the way you are
And I will, love you, different
You pull up in a foreign
You that New York time, easy Sunday morning (front seat)
When we touch I think we skip a beat (beep, beep, beep)
It's a movie with you, got me at the edge (let me see)
There's a beauty on your lips
I drown with every kiss
I'm not used to this
There's nothing I won't give
Don't like making promises
Just remember this
I will, love you, different
Just the way you are
And I will, love you, different
That's what you been looking for
You're the fruit of my life
That patient kind
That tongue got me tongue-tied
And that's why
I will, love you, different
Just the way you are
No matter how different, you're beautiful
I can't make this up, no, baby
Ain't no need to beat your face in Fenty
Want you on the cover, under covers
Ain't no rubbers on this planet
I'll treat you like a mother (let's make babies)
There's beauty on your lips
I drown with every kiss
I'm not used to this
There's nothing I won't give
Don't like making promises
Just remember this
I will, love you, different
Just the way you are
And I will, love you, different
That's what you been looking for
You're the fruit of my life
That patient kind
That tongue got me tongue-tied
And that's why
I will, love you, different
Just the way you are
I and I
Need you in my life
Even when the fire burning I need you fi di light
It's a different night
With you right by my side
You mix the color, color, color, color, see the future bright
This here mutual, it's not usual
When I'm around you I-I-I (oh)
Dem goose bumps, dem goose bumps
The truth hurt and you know
A real ting we feel this time (oh)
You gimme goose bumps yeah, yeah
I will, love you, different
Just the way you are
And I will, love you, different
That's what you been looking for
