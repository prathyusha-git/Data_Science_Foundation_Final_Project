Got you, oh, yeah, yeah
I got a hold of you, oh, yeah, ooh, whoa
You said you out to see how we roll
Well, I'll take a seat, ooh, yeah
Oh, take a seat and watch your ass go
Break it, drop it, drink it, spill it
Baby, touch your body, body
You gotta taste it, feel it, I've been on it
Baby, don't you worry, you gotta keep up
'Cause I've been gone, ah
I've been gone, ay

Girl, why don't you fuck what you heard, baby?
'Cause I've been gone
You can see for yourself, little lady
Gotta let 'em get me something
Something, something for you
There's enough to pass around
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Oh well, just break it, drop it, drink it, spill it
Baby, touch your body, body
You gotta taste it, feel it, I've been on it
Baby, don't you worry, don't you worry, you gotta keep up
'Cause I've been gone
I, I've been gone, ay, ay

Hope I make it home, you'll be thinking, love
I got the whole city on my side tonight, tonight
Watch us rock it out, watch us leave the ground
After the show is done, you can take me to yours
But my lungs so muddy, I love the way it tastes
Drink it 'til I'm ugly, baby, fuck me while I'm faded
Feel that through my denims, baby girl, I gotcha
I'm only 21, so I do it when I wanna
Gone from the codeine, 'methazine, lean
Got me feelin' kinda weak, and it's kinda hard to breathe
But you're turning 23, so I'll fuck you if you need
In your birthday suit, I'ma give you what you fiend, oh
But I ain't takin' off my black boots
I'm fallin' 'cause I'm numb from the neck down
I'm sorry, you won't know that I can't feel it
I can win a fuckin' Oscar by the way I fuckin' did it
Yeah, you'll never fuckin' know, I'll never fuckin' show it
Except when I be wheezy from another cup of potion
Dirty Sprite toastin', fast life, fuck slow
Low life for life, let the meds flow
Ooh, whoa, let the night flow
I'm so, I'm so gone, let these meds flow
Ooh, I'm so gone, oh, let these meds flow
I'm so gone, I'm so gone
Said I'm gone, gone, gone
