Can you see the wreckage now
Of all we had and all we lost?
The smell of roses, broken glass
All the tears and all the scars
Did we get the message, mm-mm
Of all the love and what it cost?
We're unfolding, holding on now
Will it get better? There's nothing left
It was forever, so what is next?
Used to be Heaven, lost grip, then fell
Now we're speeding to the ground
Ah-ah
It's almost over, don't look down
Ah-ah
It's almost over, don't look down
Ah-ah
It's almost over, don't look down
Ah-ah
It's almost over, don't look down
Give ourselves a second now
To take a breath and take a pause
We're imploding into dust
And I don't know how to make it stop
Write a different ending now
To turn this storm into a calm
Turning pages, burning out now
Will it get better? There's nothing left
It was forever, so what is next?
Used to be Heaven, lost grip, then fell
Now we're speeding to the ground
Ah-ah
It's almost over, don't look down
Ah-ah
It's almost over, don't look down
Ah-ah
It's almost over, don't look down
Ah-ah
It's almost over, don't look down
Let it fade away
Let it fade away
Let it fade away
'Til we feel nothing
Let it fade away
Let it fade away
Let it fade away
'Til we feel nothing
Ah-ah
It's almost over, don't look down
Ah-ah
It's almost over, don't look down
