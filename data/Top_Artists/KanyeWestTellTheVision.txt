N-, we made it (grr, woo, bah)
N-, we made it, we made it (woo)
N-, we made it (woo)
Thank God that I made it
N-, we made it, we made it (woo)
Look, momma, I made it
Look, I remember the days, same fit for a week straight
I used to eat 50-cent cake, now it's Philippe's
It's Philippe's for the steak, buy it, I don't care what it cost
And I always keep a pole, I did a hundred on a pro
If you droppin' a woo, we come where you live
Glock 9, infrared, pull up and empty the clip
Dread had the strap all summer in the Floss movin' reckless
Please do not play with me, n-, I keep a K with me
N-, we made it (grr, woo)
N-, we made it, we made it (woo)
N-, we made it (woo)
Thank God that I made it
