Midnight awakin', hyper ventilatin'
Drunk laps runnin' 'round the globe, wild goose chasin'
After three number-one albums, woulda thought I'd feel amazin'
Still impatient, still sippin' on liquor, still rollin' up Swishers
Now it's Bimmers double-parking, fuck payin' the meter
In the club, on the couches, got paid to be here
On the girl, rubbin' on my favorite features
How could they tease us? Only wanted Ben Franklins and Mona Lisas
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
Man, I might fuck 'round, lose my mind, I gotta break out
I'm on a stakeout, on a farm or your lake house
Around 3 a.m., dawg, I was gettin' busy in the bathroom stall
Bad mamacita, Miami Heat her, put her in a two-seater
Too bad I couldn't three-peat her
Need a whole lotta vida 'fore I see the reaper
House full of snow bunnies, puttin' trees up like it's Christmas Easter
With more stamps than a skinny nigga, got tats on my visa
I know the kids in La Flame, they don't trust, they believe it, I mean (I mean)
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
Man, I might fuck 'round, lose my mind, I gotta break out
I'm on a stakeout, on a farm or your lake house
Jesus, Jesus (I mean), Jesus, Jesus
Man, I might fuck 'round, lose my mind, I gotta break out
I'm on a stakeout, on a farm or your lake house
Jesus, Jesus (I mean), Jesus, Jesus
I might fuck 'round, lose my mind
Jesus
(Mm-mm-mm, mm)
(Mm-mm-mm-mm)
Jesus, Jesus
