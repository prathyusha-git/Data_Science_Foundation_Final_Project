Catfish Caviar, south of Florida cigar
Stag grip single action fallin' out my chrome hearts
Platinum on my teeth, wagyu on my grill
And George Jones crankin' out my coupe deville
Yeah, I'm a five star
Hell raisin' dive bar rockstar
I got a thing for the finer things
I'm in that deer blind with a diamond ring
My lambo and my ammo's all camo green
Yeah, I got an F-1 Trillion limousine
I got a ten-point blonde in the shotgun seat
I got a thing, got a thing for the finer things
Yeah, I do

I got a 50 foot pontoon, tripled up Evinrude
Leaving me a tidal wave of wake when I flow through
Sippin' on a solo of Pappy Reserve
Big H on the top for my getaway bird
Aw, turn up the "Ramblin' Man"
'Til the whole lake knows I'm a Hank fan
I got a thing for the finer things
I'm in that deer blind with a diamond ring
My lambo and my ammo's all camo green
Yeah, I got an F-1 Trillion limousine
I got a ten-point blonde in the shotgun seat
I got a thing, got a thing for the finer things
Yeah, I do
