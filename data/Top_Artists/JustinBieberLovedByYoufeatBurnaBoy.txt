I bought a castle in France
And it's the same one I built in the sand for you
When I was two
I thought I painted a picture of heaven
But it turns out it's just your room, just your room
I'd run off the end of the earth just to see if you'd catch me
When I know you'd let me fall every time
(All I do) is wish that I could change myself
I wish that I could change my-
(All I do) is wait around and hate myself
Oh, I hate the way I need to be loved by you
I wish that I could change myself
I wish that I could change my-
(All I do) is wait around and hate myself
Oh, I hate the way I need to be loved by you
♪
I need to be loved by you
I need to be loved by you
I need to be loved by you
I need to be loved by you
I remember when we started datin'
The only ting that you and me was chasin'
The kinda lovin' that they couldn't play with
You know my lovin' is a everyday ting, baby
And when we in different places
Textin' and messagin' and talkin' crazy
When I'm with you, I feel like it's a daydream
That's how I know that you would always be my baby
(All I do) is wish that I could change myself
I wish that I could change my-
(All I do) is wait around and hate myself
Oh, I hate the way I need to be loved by you
I wish that I could change myself
I wish that I could change my-
(All I do) is wait around and hate myself
Oh, I hate the way I need to be loved by you
I walked a thousand miles
I've opened every door
It's not enough, it's still your love I'm always lookin' for
It's just the way I'm wired
Whether I'm wrong or right
I've only got one thing on my mind
I need to be loved by you
I need to be loved by you
I need to be loved by you (you)
I need to be loved by you
I need to be loved by you
