And I know she'll be the death of me
At least, we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me
The worst is yet to come
But at least, we'll both be beautiful and stay forever young
This I know, yeah, girl, I know
One time
She told me, "Don't worry about it"
She told me, "Don't worry no more"
We both know we can't go without it
She told me, "You'll never be-"
One, two, three, let's go
(I can't feel my face when I'm with you)
Yeah
But I love it, but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you, hey
But I love it, hey, but I love it
And I know she'll be the death of me
At least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me
The worst is yet to come
All the misery was necessary when we're deep in love
This I know, yeah, girl, I know
One time
She told me, "Don't- (worry about it)"
She told me, "Don't worry no more"
We both know we can't go without it
She told me, "You'll never be alone", let's go
(I can't feel my face when I'm with you)
Yeah, but I love it, hey, but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you, hey
But I love it, say, but I love it
I can't feel my face when I'm with you, oh
But I love it, say, but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you, oh
But I love when I'm with you, baby
Oh-oh, ooh
She told me, "Don't worry" (about it)
She told me, "Don't worry" (no more)
We both know we can't go (without it)
She told me, "You'll never be alone"
Let's go
(I can't feel my face when I'm with you)
I can't feel my face, girl (but I love it)
But I love it, babe, yes, I love it
I said I can't feel my face when (I'm with you)
I can't feel my face, girl (but I love it)
When I'm with you, baby (but I love it)
When I'm with you, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you, oh
But I love it, yeah, but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you, oh
But I-, when I'm with you, baby
Los Angeles, make some noise
Oh, say
