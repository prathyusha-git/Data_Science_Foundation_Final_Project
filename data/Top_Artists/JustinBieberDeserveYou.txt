When I'm in my thoughts sometimes
It's hard to believe I'm the person you think I am
The person that you tell me you love
I'm on my ten thousandth life
Nine thousand nine hundred nine and it slipped my hands
But this one I'm not givin' up
Night after night, you fall asleep on me
I'm prayin' that I don't go back to who I was
I feel like I don't deserve you tonight
It's in the way that you hold me
I don't deserve you tonight
It's in the things that you showed me
I need you, don't let me go, need you, don't let me go
I feel like I don't de-, I don't de-, I don't deserve you tonight
I can tend to hold things back
I need you more than I let you believe, I do
'Cause you could think it might be too much, oh, yeah
I don't wanna be my past
Oh, when we kiss I'm alive, and I feel brand new
There's nothing that I want more than us (na-na-na-na-na)
Night after night, you fall asleep on me (asleep on me)
I'm prayin' that I don't go back to who I was (oh, no, no, no)
I feel like I don't deserve you tonight
It's in the way that you hold me
I don't deserve you tonight
It's in the things that you showed me
I need you, don't let me go, need you, don't let me go
I feel like I don't de-, I don't de-, I don't deserve you tonight
Somewhere in the sky, the way your body fits on mine
And when you give in to me, so high but I'm fallin' (na-na-na)
And now my eyes are locked on you (yeah)
As you dance around the room (yeah-yeah)
And finally, I'm right where I belong, oh, oh
I feel like I don't deserve you tonight
It's in the way that you hold me
I don't deserve you tonight (I don't deserve you)
It's in the things that you showed me (I can't breathe without you)
I need you, don't let me go (hey), need you, don't let me go
I feel like I don't de-, I don't de-, I don't deserve you tonight
(I don't deserve you) No, I don't, no
(I don't deserve you) Girl, I need you
I can't breathe without you
