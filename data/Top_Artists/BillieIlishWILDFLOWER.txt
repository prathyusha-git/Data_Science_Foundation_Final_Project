Things fall apart, and time breaks your heart
I wasn't there, but I know
She was your girl, you showed her the world
You fell out of love, and you both let go
She was cryin' on my shoulder, all I could do was hold her
Only made us closer until July
And I know that you love me, you don't need to remind me
I should put it all behind me, shouldn't I?
But I see her in the back of my mind
All the time
Like a fever, like I'm burning alive
Like a sign
Did I cross the line?
Mm, hm

Well, good things don't last (good things don't last)
And life moves so fast (life moves so fast)
I'd never ask who was better (I'd never ask who was better)
'Cause she couldn't be (she couldn't be)
More different from me (more different from me)
Happy and free (happy and free) in leather
And I know that you love me (you love me)
You don't need to remind me (remind me)
Wanna put it all behind me, but, baby
I see her in the back of my mind (back of my mind)
All the time (all the time)
Feels like a fever (like a fever), like I'm burning alive (burning alive)

You say no one knows you so well (so)
But every time you touch me, I just wonder how she felt
Valentine's Day, crying in the hotel
I know you didn't mean to hurt me, so I kept it to myself (oh)
And I wonder
Do you see her in the back of your mind?
In my eyes?
