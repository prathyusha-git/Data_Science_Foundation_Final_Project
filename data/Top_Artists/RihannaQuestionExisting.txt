Love, oh
♪
Hmm
Take off my shirt
Loosen the buttons and undo my skirt
Stare at myself in the mirror
Pick me apart piece by piece
Sorrow decreased, pressure release
I put in work, did more than called upon
More than deserved
When it was over, did I wind up hurt? (Yes)
But it taught me
Before a decision, ask this question first
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing

Take off my cool (take off my cool)
Show them that under here, I'm just like you
Do the mistakes I've made make me a fool
Or a human with flaws?
Admit that I'm lost, round of applause (round of applause)
Take the abuse
Sometimes, it feels like they want me to lose
It's entertainment, is that an excuse? (No)
But the question that lingers, whether win or lose is
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?

Dear diary, it's Robyn
Entertaining is something I do for a living
This is not who I am
I'd like to think that I'm pretty normal
I laugh, I get mad, I hurt
I think I suck sometimes
But when you're in the spotlight, everything seems good (ooh, yeah)
Sometimes I feel like I have it worst
'Cause I have to always keep my guard up
I don't know who to trust
I don't know who wants to date me for who I am
Or who wants to be my friend for who I really am
