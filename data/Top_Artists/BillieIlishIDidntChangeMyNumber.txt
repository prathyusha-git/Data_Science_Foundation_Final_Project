Mm-mm, I
I didn't change my number
I only changed who I reply to
Laura said I should be nicer
But not to you
I love a "You mad at me?" text
Should've guessed
That you would think I was upset
You're obsessed
Don't take it out on me
I'm out of sympathy for you
Maybe you should leave
Before I get too mean
I didn't change my number
I only changed who I believe in
You were easy on the eyes, eyes, eyes (eyes)
But looks can be deceiving
I gotta work, I go to work
You don't deserve to feel so hurt
You gotta a lot of fucking nerve
I don't deserve, so
Don't take it out on me
I'm out of sympathy for you
Maybe you should leave
Before I get too mean
And take it out on you
And your best friend too
I should have left when Drew
Said you were bad news
