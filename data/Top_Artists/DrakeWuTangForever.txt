(Machine gun rap for all my niggas in the back) I
I just love when I'm with you
Yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation
And you'd tell me, "Baby, it's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody" and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays, when I ask about who got it
They say, "It's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody
It's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, that's for sure
That's for sure, yeah
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours, that's for sure
That's for sure"
How you feel about
Comin' home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights
I know we only fucking out of spite
'Cause your man don't
Do you right
Do you right
I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9:00 a.m. in Dallas
Who you like, baby, who you like?
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's about who did it right, niggas looking like "Preach"
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily, I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there 'cause there's niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried 'cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was, a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory
Things change in that life and this life started lacking synergy
And fucking with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Yeah, paranoid, always rolling with my motherfuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave yo' ass with a motherfuckin' choice, man
I just love when I'm with you
Yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation
And you'd tell me, "Baby, it's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody
It's yours, nobody else's

That's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, that's for sure
That's for sure"
