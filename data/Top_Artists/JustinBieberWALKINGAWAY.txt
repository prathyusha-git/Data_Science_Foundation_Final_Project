Days go by so fast wanna spend em with you
So tell me why you're throwing stones at my back?
You know I'm defenseless
And girl we better stop before we say some shit
We've been testing our patience
I think we're better off if we just take a breath
And remember what grace is
Baby I ain't walking away
You are my diamond
Gave you a ring
Made you a promise
I told you I'd change
It's just human nature
These growing pains
And baby I ain't walking away
And every time you don't say my name
I'm reminded how I love when you say it
I know we have this moment to face
But baby I ain't walking away
Change takes times girl lets see what we can do
Cause even when they leave I keep dreaming of the best parts of you
And girl we better stop before we say some shit
We've been testing patience
I think we're better off if we just take a breath
And remember what grace is
Baby I ain't walking away
You are my diamond
Gave you a ring
Made you a promise
I told you I'd change
It's just human nature
These growing pains
And baby I ain't walking away
And every time you don't say my name
I'm reminded how I love when you say it
I know we have this moment to face
But baby I ain't walking away
