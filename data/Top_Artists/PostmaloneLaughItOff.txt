When we was lying down on the floor
You said I should smile more
I was killing your vibe
Pretend I didn't hear your voice
But baby, I was taking notes
Keep that in mind
Hey, you say you hate me
Ha-ha, I laugh it off
Your mind is made, and I can't change it
Somehow
♪
Haven't seen the sun in a month
But it's all sunshine
I forgot how to cry
It feels like pain, pain is a world away
Took my cigarettes and flushed them down the drain now
Okay, okay, I'm lying
Mmm, hey, you say you hate me
Ha-ha, I laugh it off
Your mind is made, and I can't change it
Somehow, I laugh it off
And if I learned anything at all
Smile
Talk to me, I know it's over
I'll listen like I did before
Hey, you say you hate me
Ha-ha, I laughed it off
When I fuck up, like I have lately
Somehow, I laugh it off
And if I learned anything at all
Smile, smile
And if I learned anything at all
Smile, smile
