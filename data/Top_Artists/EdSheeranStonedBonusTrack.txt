I wasn't looking for a hideaway
I need the heat of a thousand bodies
Crowds will devour, I don't need breathing space
Consumed by hopelessness and all my worries
Save me, colours erase, nothing will fill up the space
I'm drowning under the waves and so out of place
I'm feeling a way, maybe this life was a waste
Should I just throw it away?
All my friends have settled and grown
And then there's me here dancing alone
Fuelled by heartbreak mixed with the chemicals
They are sleeping and I am stoned
All my friends have settled and grown
And then there's me here dancing alone
Am I breathing into my detriment?
I'll keep bleeding and I'll be
Stoned
I don't want to have to cry again
Well, say to them "Goodbye and I'm so sorry"
This pain crescendos right until the end
Keep telling myself that it's them and not me
Save me, colours erase, nothing will fill up the space
Drowning under the waves and so out of place
I'm feeling a way, maybe this life was a waste
Should I just throw it away?
All my friends have settled and grown
And then there's me here dancing alone
Fuelled by heartbreak mixed with the chemicals
They are sleeping and I am stoned
All my friends have settled and grown
And then there's me here dancing alone
Am I breathing into my detriment?
I'll keep bleeding and I'll be
Stoned
