Head spinnin' like revolvin' doors
Jaws droppin', watch them hit the floor
Ain't even fair, no point in keepin' score
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, there she go
Yeah, that's my baby right there, there she go
Dirty dancin', both hands in the air, there she go
Make you stutter, make you stop and stare
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, there she go
One, two, three, I'ma show you how you can count on me
Talk is cheap, so I'ma let all my actions speak, yeah
Centerfold, baby, goin' vogue, crazy
Rock and roll, you're my rollin' stone, baby
Must be natural 'cause you don't even notice
How you don't go nowhere without goin' unnoticed
It's tunnel vision, baby, way you keep me focused
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Head spinnin' like revolvin' doors
Jaws droppin', watch 'em hit the floor
Ain't even fair, no point in keepin' score
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, there she go
Yeah, that's my baby right there, there she go
Dirty dancin', both hands in the air, there she go
Make you stutter, make you stop and stare
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, there she go
Hey mami, that's my baby
That's my best friend (that's my best friend)
I hear you callin', see you ringing from your left hand (brr-brr)
Locked it down when you wanted, that hopeless romance
This happened so fast, I love it when we slow dance
You can break it down, you don't need a pole
I'm so proud of you, I bust you down in rose gold
Don't be ashamed, girl, I messed around, you messed up too
It all changed when you took my name and went insane, mmh
Must be natural 'cause you don't even notice
How you don't go nowhere without goin' unnoticed
It's tunnel vision, baby, way you keep me focused
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, there she go
Yeah, that's my baby right there, there she go
Dirty dancin', both hands in the air, there she go
Make you stutter, make you stop and stare
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, there she go
Yeah, that's my baby right there, there she go
Dirty dancin', both hands in the air, there she go
Make you stutter, make you stop and stare
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, there she go
There she go, lookin' like a shinnin' star now
I'm takin' time off just to figure out your heart now
I'm feelin' different every time I hear your heart pound
Automatic lovin' when we make them car sounds
I'ma beep beep, go fast, I can't park 'round (yeah)
Nobody that don't respect late night talks and all sounds
That's from the Skybounds, I'm a good guy now
I'm no dog, no, no, I am no hound
Your beauty brighter than the light, like what is dark now?
From dedication, I can't lie, it made you smart now (yeah)
I took my shot and yeah, I missed, but got the rebound
Diamond so-so cool, got you high now (there she go)
Yeah, that's my baby right there, there she go
Dirty dancin', both hands in the air, there she go
Make you stutter, make you stop and stare
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, there she go
Yeah, that's my baby right there, there she go
Hands in the air, there she go
Yeah, that's my baby right there, there she go
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, there she go
