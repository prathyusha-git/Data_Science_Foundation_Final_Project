Say it's my year, know it's my year, my year (oh)
Can we fly, yeah? We can fly, yeah, high, yeah (we can fly)
Build a city in the sky, yeah, sky, yeah
In the sky, yeah, in the sky, yeah, sky, yeah (git, git)
We just fly, yeah (whoo), we just fly yeah, fly yeah (git, git, fly, yeah)
Build a city, in the sky, yeah, sky, yeah
Do Heaven got a penthouse that I could rent out?
I could see Rick James with his feet up on Prince couch
Always wanted to know, did Biggie get a big house?
Do Pac got a thug mansion? Is it pimped out?
Is it a place for the Jews and the Gentiles?
I heard street niggas ain't in the top percentile
Real fast, my wife wanna know, do y'all got a gym now?
She talkin' 'bout she still tryna get her waist to slim down
Anyhow, forgive me for the taxes that I didn't file
I ain't even got back the money that I lent out
Can't even have a Corona, shit is gettin' wild
Runnin' around without a face mask like I'm Jim Brown
Oh, yeah, I heard about your son that you sent down
I wish there was a place that I could send flowers
My OG wrote me from the joint, you know, like a pen pal
And he asked if you could send a letter to the judge when he begin trial
'Cause we don't know when he gettin' out
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
Oh, child, things'll get brighter
Say it's my year, know it's my year, my year (oh)
Can we fly, yeah? We can fly, yeah, high, yeah (we can fly, yeah)
Build a city in the sky, yeah, sky, yeah
In the sky, yeah, in the sky, yeah, sky, yeah (git, git)
We just fly, yeah (whoo), we just fly, yeah, fly, yeah (git, git, fly, yeah)
Build a city, in the sky, yeah, sky, yeah
Yeah, imagine you could visit your ancestors
And all the people that we lost, and you could dance with 'em
We'd probably be more united than Manchester
'Cause my people still dyin' over hand gestures
Keep your enemy close, that's when your man stretch ya
Damn, I guess karma can catch ya
We gotta forgive our trespassers and transgressors
Mandela said, "It won't get better if we stand separate"
'Cause one hand wash the other, both hands wash the face
Wish they had another place we all could stay
If they don't let us in, then we gon' hop the gate
Out of the body, uh, jewelry is gaudy, um
Serious society, my spirit is Godly
I'm buildin' a buildin' where children can lobby
So we can make billions from buildin' a hobby
I bought a factory, pickin' the cotton
Bought a factory, send 'em to college
He made it already with nothin' to lose
And free attitude with nothin' to prove
We goin' 50, I got that juice
Playin' them dead to get out the noose
I don't need your point-of-views
I can't hear you at this altitude
And they steady sayin' that I'm rude
I'd be rude if I don't come beat the shit out you
And if we die, yeah, then we die, yeah, aw, yeah
We can fly, yeah, we can fly, yeah, aw, yeah
In the night, yeah, in the night, yeah, aw, yeah
In the night, in the night
Oh, in the night, serenity all in the city
I hope I never fall weary
Help me levitate my pain
Oh, good Heaven, sing to me, to me
Let me outsoar my faith
Let me outlast the shame
At the same time, don't change a thing, a thing
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
