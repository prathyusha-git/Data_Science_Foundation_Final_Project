I just bought a new Lamborghini
That SOB goes 225
You called my phone, said you wanted to see me
I couldn't think of a better reason to drive
Lead pedal
For your lovin' I would run all the lights
Won't let go
And I can't wait to push my speedometer
Push my, push my, push my, push
Speedometer
Push my, push my, push my, push
Speedometer
Turn the lights off
And put the record on
That you showed me that makes you so horny
Let's make a baby tonight
Lead pedal
For your lovin' I would run all the lights
Damn, uh-oh
Yes, I know how fast I was going, please officer
Push my, push my, push my, push
Speedometer
Push my, push my, push my, push
