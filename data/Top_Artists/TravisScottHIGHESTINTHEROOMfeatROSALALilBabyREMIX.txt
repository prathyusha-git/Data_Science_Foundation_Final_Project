Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I got room, in my fumes (Yeah)
She fill my mind up with ideas
I'm the highest in the room (It's lit)
Hope I make it outta here (Let's go)
She saw my eyes, she know I'm gone (Ah)
I see some things that you might fear
I'm doin' a show, I'll be back soon (Soon)
That ain't what she wanna hear (Nah)
Now I got her in my room (Ah)
Legs wrapped around my beard (Uh)
Got the fastest car, it zoom (Zoom)
Hope we make it outta here
When I'm with you, I feel alive
You say you love me, don't you lie (Yeah)
Won't cross my heart, don't wanna die
Keep the pistol on my side (Yeah)
Case it's fumes
She fill my mind up with ideas (Straight up)
I'm the highest in the room (It's lit)
Hope I make it outta here (Let's go)
Su black Ferrari le doy gas (Uh)
Caballos suenan con delay ('Lay)
Si quieres duro el quiere má'
Aquí siempre hay un beso de ley (Uy)
Si ahora de fiera no me fuera a conocer
Chaqueta al hombro y la cadena hasta el pie
Si ahora de fiera no me fuera a conocer (We can't)
Lolly-lollypop viene cash (Yeah)
Ay, shine ya la' joya' (Yeah)
Balas que duelen por detrás (Yeah)
Broom broom, yo también acicalá (Cicalá)
Ojalá que me cojas confesá'
Ah, this my life, I did not choose
Uh, been on this since we was kids
We gon' stay on top and break the rules
Uh, I fill my mind up with ideas
Case it's fumes
She fill my mind up with ideas (Straight up)
I'm the highest in the room (I'm the highest, it's lit)
Hope I make it outta here
Baby, I just left from Vegas
Did 'em dirty on the table
Went and bought a new Bentayga
I paid cash, don't see no paper
Buy it, park it, tint it later
All my cars' inside tomato
From Atlanta, not Decatur
I'm the one they say don't play with
Make them boys get on your tater
High-five LeBron, floor seat the Lakers
Get more paper, get more haters
Standin' still, my diamonds skatin'
Fucked her once, she think we datin'
I can spend it, I been savin'
I'ma spin ya, try to play me
I been trappin' up the millions, used to trap it off a RAZR
Back when I was sellin' two-for-five plays, called in my RAZR
Niggas never had to give it to me, I want it, I'ma take it
Guaranteed to tell a ho goodbye if she don't try to get naked
I'm like mmh
Mmh, gotta get up out my room
Got some more bad vibes comin' through
Mmh, she gon' bust a move ('Cicalá)
Like you do
(I'm the highest, you might got the midas)
(This might this divide us and my bit confide in us)
(I recite it, am I too excited?)
(You're a giant, you a true giant) (Highest)
(You a giant, you a true giant)
(I'm a giant, you're a true giant)
(Cicalá)
