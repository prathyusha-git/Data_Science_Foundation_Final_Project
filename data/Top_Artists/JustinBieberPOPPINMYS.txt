Mm, lil' mama wanna be right beside me
Lil' mama wanna be just like me
I'm poppin' my shit, poppin' my shit
I'm poppin' my shit, poppin' my shit
Mm, lil' mama wanna be right beside me
Lil' mama wanna be just like me
I'm poppin' my shit, poppin', my shit
I'm poppin' my shit, poppin', my shit
Through these bust down Cartier's, I see everybody
Picture-perfect, this that shit that have your head bobbin'
Took her shoppin', put her in some red bottoms
Walk in the club, let her flex on everybody
Swear, I'll always have your back, you take care of me
Takin' shots of this tequila, living carefree
I'm tryna make sure that you comfortable, got leather seats
Take you home and bend you up just like the letter C
From Ratchet City to New Orleans
Got Cali baddies, Atlanta peaches
Once I hit, you gon' get hooked and ain't gon' never leave me
Got some friends and they all love Justin Bieber
Mm, lil' mama wanna be right beside me
Lil' mama wanna be just like me
I'm poppin' my shit, poppin' my shit
I'm poppin' my shit, poppin' my shit
Mm, lil' mama wanna be right beside me
Lil' mama wanna be just like me
I'm poppin' my shit, poppin', my shit
I'm poppin' my shit, poppin', my shit
Lil' mama wanna be
