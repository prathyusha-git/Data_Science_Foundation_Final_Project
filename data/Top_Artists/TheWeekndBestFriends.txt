Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Hey
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, what we got
Baby, what we got
Is secure, been a part
Of toxic love, it tore us apart
Things you want
I'm not looking for
You're my best friend now
You're my best friend now
Oh, I don't want
To be responsible
For your heart if we fall
'Cause I'll get clumsy and tear it apart
I love you so
But we can't get close
You're my best friend now
You're my best friend now
Oh, I love it when we climax
And I would never burn ya
I could never hurt ya
If we do it like that
Don't try to take it further
Focus on the friendship
Getting a little sidetracked
Catching little feelings
Thought we had arrangements
Thought you weren't like that
Yeah (uh-uh), I thought you weren't like that
Oh, friends no more
Sex as friends no more
You don't wanna have sex as friends no more
Friends no more
Ooh, ooh, friends no more
Sex as friends no more
You don't wanna have sex as friends no more, oh
Oh, what we got (oh, yeah)
Baby, what we got
Is secure, been a part
Of toxic love, it tore us apart (oh, yeah)
Things you want
I'm not looking for (I'm not searching, yeah)
You're my best friend now (oh baby)
You're my best friend now
Oh, I don't want
To be responsible
For your heart if we fall (oh, no)
'Cause I'll get clumsy and tear it apart
I love you so (oh, yeah)
But we can't get close
You're my best friend now (best friend now)
You're my best friend now (best friend now)
