This is for the OG XO fans in Los Angeles tonight
Oh yeah, we going back in time right now
Talk to me
♪
When I got on stage, she swore I was six feet tall
But when she put it in her mouth
She can't seem to reach my, so said
B-B-B-Ballin' ain't an issue for me
I'll make a hundred stacks right back next week
And do it all again, I'm faded off the wrong things, the wrong things
And I'll admit, baby, I'm a little camera-shy
But exceptions can be made, baby, 'cause you're too damn fly
For what it's worth, I hope you enjoy the show
'Cause if you're back here only takin' pictures
You gon' have to take your ass home
'Cause the only thing you're takin' is your clothes off
Go 'head, girl, strip it down, close your mouth
I just wanna hear your body talk (woah ooh woah)
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
Oh baby, don't hold back, let it out
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
Oh girl, don't hold back, let it out (hey), talk to me
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
Don't hold back, let it out (hey, hey, hey, hey)
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
Don't hold back
