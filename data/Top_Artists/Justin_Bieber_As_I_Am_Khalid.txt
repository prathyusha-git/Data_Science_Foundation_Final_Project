By myself sometimes to give my mind some space
Yeah, I know, yeah, I know that it hurts
When I push your love away, I hate myself
I wanna tell you lies so your heart won't break
Yeah, I know, yeah, I know that I made my fair share of mistakes
Sometimes, I don't know why you love me
Sometimes, I don't know why you care
Take me with the good and the ugly
Say, "I'm not goin' anywhere"
Take me as I am, swear I do the best I can
Say "I'm not goin' anywhere"
Take mе as I am, swear I do the best I can
Say, "I'm not goin' anywhеre"
A thousand miles apart, yeah, you're the one that hurt my heart
It's no surprise, and I tell you all of the time
And when life gets way too hard, I'll meet you in the stars
You know I will, I'll keep you near
As I wipe away your tears, yes
Sometimes, I don't know why you love me
Sometimes, I don't know why you care
Take me with the good and the ugly
Say, "I'm not goin' anywhere"
Take me as I am, swear I do the best I can
Say, "I'm not goin' anywhere"
Take me as I am, swear I do the best I can
Say, "I'm not goin' anywhere"
You were there for me when I was actin' selfish
And you prayed for me when I was out of faith
You believed in me when ain't nobody else did
It's a miracle you didn't run away
You were there for me when I was actin' selfish
And you prayed for me when I was out of faith
