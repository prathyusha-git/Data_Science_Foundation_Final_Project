It happens every time
If it counts, I'll lose my courage when I need it the most
Then it comes crawling up after
Begs me to ask her what I already know
Singing, "Oh, love, get me out of the cold."
If I promise that I'd take you there with me
Would you go?
I found, in one step, I'll get closer to heaven than you'll ever know
You may never know
♪
Feel it out again
Go and try to be your man when there's a gun to your head
After you've found out your "good enough" wasn't good enough for everyone else
Singing, "Oh, love, get me out of the cold,"
Pull me right up by your fire and I'll show you what home means now
The words came with a new kind of sadness
They meant everything, you mean everything to me
♪
I'll take the first train out of this town
With a glare in my eye and my pockets full, ready to die
And when I get hazy, I will think, just maybe, you're out there somewhere
Singing, "Oh, love, get me out of the cold."
If I promise that I'd take you there with me
Would you go?
I found, in one step, I'll get closer to heaven than you'll ever know
You may never know
Singing, "Oh, love, get me out of the cold,"
Pull me right up by your fire, and I'll show you what home means now
The words came with a new kind of sadness
They meant everything, you mean everything to me.
