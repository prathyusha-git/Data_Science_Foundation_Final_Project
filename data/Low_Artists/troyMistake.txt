Spinning
Spinning around again
You need someone to talk you down
You're wanting the touch of her hand
But she's not here no more
You're not here no more
So why you keep coming back?
Round and round and round we go
Round and round and round we go
Round and round and round until I can't see straight
Fall back into your arms for another mistake
Lying
You're lying so close to me
The breathlessness is killing me
Oh and I just you to leave
But I can't let you go
I want to let you go
But who would I be?
Oh oh Round and round and round we go
Round and round and round we go
Round and round and round until I can't see straight
Fall back into your arms for another mistake
Go to someone else arms, look into someone else's eyes
Play with someone else heart, mess with someone else's mind
Touch someone else's hips, kiss someone else's lips
I'm done crying your tears again and again, when you won't cry for me.
I wish you'd cry for me
But round and round and round you go
Round and round and round you go
Round and round and round until you can't see straight
Into someone else's arms someone else's mistake
Someone else's arms for another mistake
Fall back into your arms for another
Mistake
