He rocks in the treetops all the day long
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and a-singing this song
Every little bird, every little bee
Loves to hear the Robin goin' tweet-tweet-tweet
Rockin' Robin (Tweet, twiddley dee)
Rockin' Robin (Tweet, twiddley dee)
Yeah, go Rockin' Robin, really gonna rock tonight
Every little swallow, every chick-a-dee
Every little bird in the old oak tree
Wise old owl, big black crow
Put up their wings singing, "Go, bird, go"

Yeah, go Rockin' Robin, really gonna rock tonight
The chief bird standing at the birdbath stand
Taught him how to do the bop and it was grand
Start goin' steady and bless my soul
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriole
He rocks in the treetops all the day long
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and a-singing this song
Every little bird, every little bee
Loves to hear the Robin goin' tweet-tweet-tweet
