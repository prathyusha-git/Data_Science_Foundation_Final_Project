Sandy
The aurora is risin' behind us
Those pier lights
Our carnival life forever
Oh
Love me tonight for i may never see you again
Hey
Sandy girl
My baby.
Sandy
The fireworks are hailin' over little eden tonight
Forcin' a light into all those stoney faces
Left stranded on this warm july
And the boys from the casino dance with their shirts open
Like latin lovers on the shore
Chasin' all them silly new york virgins by the score.
Sandy
The aurora is risin' behind us
Those pier lights
Our carnival life forever
Oh
Love me tonight and i promise i'll love your forever
Oh
I mean it sandy girl
Oh my baby
Hey sandy girl
My my my my baby.
Sandy
The waitress i was seein' lost her desire for me
I spoke with her last night
She said
She won't set herself on fire for me anymore
Did you hear
The cops finally busted madame marie
For tellin' fortunes better than they do
For me
This boardwalk life's through
You ought to quit this scene too.
Sandy
The aurora is risin' behind us
Those pier lights
Our carnival life forever
Oh love me tonight for i may never see you again
Hey
Sandy girl
My my my baby
Hey sandy girl
Oh my baby
