I wrote a song for you and then it came to life
I was hoping you would notice
♪
If every moment in my life
Could be as memorable as this one
I would never feel alone
Ever again, I swear to God
And I could tell you everything
That's ever happened to me
And every reason I don't care
But I'd still see you waiting there
I wrote a song for you and then it came to life
I was hoping you would notice
And I had a feeling that I'll sing for you tonight
We're all broken and we know it
♪
When you were falling into me
Floating down so gracefully
Soft and sweet and scared to bend
Cause you might break in two again
I know the way it ends
At least until it all begins again
When everyone moves on
If you're stuck you should come along
I wrote a song for you and then it came to life
I was hoping you would notice
And I had a feeling that I'll sing for you tonight
We're all broken and we know it
♪
It's just one of those days
It's just one of those days
♪
I wrote a song for you and then it came to life
I was hoping you would notice
And I had a feeling that I'll sing for you tonight
We're all broken and we know it
