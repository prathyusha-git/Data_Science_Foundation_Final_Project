I felt betrayed by
My own insides
And I felt shame when I prayed that you'd die
I don't want to feel anything at all
If I don't have to
I don't want to feel anything
If I don't have to
Cause it can be so cruel
♪
I should be patient
And if the ancient
Carry on my wayward son
But I don't want to be anything at all
If I don't have to
I don't want to be in anything
If I don't have to
Nothing's nothing too
Nothing's nothing too
Nothing's nothing too
Nothing's nothing too
Nothing's nothing too
Nothing's nothing too
Nothing's nothing too
