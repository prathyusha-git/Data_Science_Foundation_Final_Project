Don't you know it's time for love?
Don't you know it's time for love?
It's time to tell them about our love
Secretly you won my heart
Secretly you won my heart
Now all the world knows we'll never part
What can I do?
What can I say?
We both know we love each other
We both know we love each other
It's time to tell them about our love
What can I do?
What can I say?
We both know we love each other
We both know we love each other
Don't you know it's time for love?
Don't you know it's time for love?
It's time to tell them about our love
It's time to tell them about our love
Don't you know it's time for love?
