I went and messed around with her heart
So now she's run off with my car
But I can't live without her
(And it's so hard to take)
So I've set off out to find her
I'm back on the motorway
At this wheel I'd drive the earth for her
Every carriageway a mile for her
These five gears and wheels could drive to her
But this carriageway can't take me there
Drivin' at 90 miles per hour (miles per hour)
It's hard to know what's comin' (know what's comin')
Then on the horizon (then on the horizon)
Something makes me brake
I can see me darlin' (I can see me darlin'), ahead on the motorway
(I can see us dying on the bonnet of a chevrolet)
So why's my baby lying on the side of the motorway?
(I wish that I had never said the things that I'd told her today)
'Cause now she's left me crying on the shoulder of the motorway
At this wheel I'd drive the earth for her
Every carriageway a mile for her
These five gears and wheels could drive to her
But this carriageway can't take me there
