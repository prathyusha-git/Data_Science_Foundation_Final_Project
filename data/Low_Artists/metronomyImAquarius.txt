Just one fight and just one anniversary
So I never thought you'd be the one to up and leave
You said our love was written in the stars
But I never paid attention to my charts
But now I see how quick you must want to forget
'Cause you left the ring I bought you with your cigarettes
Well, I can finish up if you don't want them
And I can take the ring back where I got it from
I can love it or I can leave it
You said, "Honey, I best be leaving"
'Cause you're a novice, and I'm a Taurus
And I'm not gonna say, I'm not gonna do
I can love it or I can leave it
You said, "Honey, I best be leaving"
'Cause you're a Taurus, and I'm Aquarius
And I'm not gonna say, I'm not gonna do
Never thought about it sentimentally
Never saw just how much you thought I meant to me
Never learned about it at university
Never thought about it 'cause you're the first, you see
And I'm aware of the procedure
But normally it's me that leaves her
I guess I'm finished up, it's time to move on
I'm taking the ring back to where I got it from
I can love it or I can leave it
You said, "Honey, I best be leaving"
'Cause you're a novice, and I'm a Taurus
And I'm not gonna say, I'm not gonna do
I can love it or I can leave it
You said, "Honey, I best be leaving"
'Cause you're a novice, and I'm a Taurus
And we've had problems, we're notorious for them
It's what your friends said now, you're inside there now
I've seen our stars and there's nothing aligning
That's 'cause I'm Aquarius, yeah, I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius, I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius, I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius, I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius, I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius, I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius, I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius, I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius, I'm Aquarius
