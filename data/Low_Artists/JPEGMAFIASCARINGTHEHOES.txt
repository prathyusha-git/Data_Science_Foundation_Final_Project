Let me see some
Every time (you think you know me)
Every time
Stop scarin' the hoes
Play that shit that'll have them touch they toes
(We don't wanna hear that weird shit no more)
(What the fuck is that? Give me back my aux cord)
Stop scarin' the hoes
Play that shit that'll have them touch they toes
(We don't wanna hear that weird shit no more)
(What the fuck is that? Give me back my aux cord)
Play somethin' for the bitches
How the fuck we supposed to make money off this shit?
You wanna be a MC? What the fuck you think, it's 1993?
Welcome to that big league, this a young man's sport
Fuck that hip-hop and that old man flow
Where the Auto-tune at? Give a fuck about a trap (scaring the hoes)
'Cause it's all about the scams, catch up, old man
Say it ain't about the bars 'cause it's all about the brand (black)
Say it ain't about the art (heels), 'cause it's all about them bands (legs)
Give a fuck about a fan (legs) put the money in my hand (I see you workin' that)
'Bout to buy a new chain, give a fuck about land (I see you workin' that)
Go vroom, vroom, vroom in that brand-new Lamb'
'Bout to go to the beach (work it), bring my own sand (work it)
I'm a businessman (whoo), you a rapper like Chance
Now work that shit, whoo
Stop scarin' the hoes
Play that shit that'll have them touch they toes
