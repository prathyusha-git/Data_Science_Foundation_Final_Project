Jesse, this is hot shit, Die
Ey, let's go, bruh
Let's go to the Caribbean
My leader
I miss you, baby love
I'ma see you soon
Fuck it, I've been so busy, spinning 'round in a whirlwind
Can't you just come here?
I just wanna be with you
I'm on a mission, but I'm missing my little girlfriend
It's cool, you gotta do what you gotta do
I'm gonna be there soon, yeah baby, tell me what you want to do
Smoke a fat blunt, and snuggle up beside of you
Oh motherfuck, there's nothing in the world that I would rather do
Zef Gang God of the world, I'm a busy girl
Listen up, baby, we're not good at home
Calling up the green for some medicinal
Weed-fucked, going out, I wanna be invisible
Pop a fat blunt in your mouth, there we go
We here chillin' like a villain, feeling all
Dazed and confused
So cute and paranoid
Dazed and confused
Dazed and confused
So dazed and confused
So cute and paranoid
Dazed and confused
Dazed and confused
So dazed and confused
So cute and paranoid
I'm in the fucking zone, yo, I've been working out all day
Taking it to the next level, I'll be stepping up my game
Mass murderer, ninja, he don't play
Got no time for a fuckboy, yo, I'll put him in his grave
We bring it hard, we make it rock
Soon I'm gonna take a break and go visit my baby love
Let's take a break, let's get away
Fuck it, I think Ninja deserves a little holiday
You, me, jump on a plane
I know where we should go, yo,, it's gonna be insane
Yo' ask your friends if they wanna go
Tell them I got it covered, I be making fucking dough
Shrooms, booms fall in the sun, chilling like a villain
Dip in the Caribbean, sipping champagne
Smoking mad weed all day
Everyday
I miss you, baby love
I'ma see you soon
Fuck it, I've been so busy, spinning 'round in a whirlwind
Can't you just come here?
I just wanna be with you
I'm on a mission, but I'm missing my little girlfriend
Just keep doing what you doing, baby, kill them all
Soon I'll be energy, then, like a villain, feeling all
Dazed and confused
So cute and paranoid
Dazed and confused
Dazed and confused
So dazed and confused
So cute and paranoid
Dazed and confused
Dazed and confused
So dazed and confused
So cute and paranoid
Oh my God!
