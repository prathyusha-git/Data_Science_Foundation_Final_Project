Couldn't tell, that's 'cause at first it was going well
You've been out of line, I've been foundin' out
Guess I'm in denial once you're going down
But I'm so disappointed how you went about it
So now I'm like
(Hey sucka nigga) Yeah
(Hey sucka nigga) Uh
Ooh-ooh, whatever happened to you
Seems like the rumors were true
Looks like you gotta figure shit out boy
Countin' all the ways I can say I made you, oh
Oh-oh-ooh
Trust me, ain't no turning back
Lame ass, broke ass, miss me with that
Sick how you played it off
Love how you think that I lost
Fuck you wherever you are
(Hey sucka nigga, hey sucka nigga)
Trust me, ain't no turning back
Lame ass, broke ass, miss me with that
Sick how you played it off
Love how you think that I lost
Fuck you wherever you are
(Hey sucka nigga, hey sucka nigga)
Jealousy, you was outta line when you texted me
Call me on my name and my momma too
While you act like nobody raised you
And I'm so disappointed how you went about it
So now I'm like
(Hey sucka nigga) Yeah
(Hey sucka nigga) Yeah
Ooh-ooh, whatever happened to you
Seems like the rumors were true
Looks like you gotta figure shit out boy
Countin' all the ways I can say I made you, oh yeah
Oh-oh-ooh
Trust me, ain't no turning back (no turning back)
Lame ass, broke ass, miss me with that (lame ass, miss me with that)
Sick how you played it off (yeah)
Love how you think that I lost (yeah)
Fuck you wherever you are
(Hey sucka nigga, hey sucka nigga)
Trust me, ain't no turning back (no turning back)
Lame ass, broke ass, miss me with that (lame ass, broke ass nigga, miss me with that)
Sick how you played it off
Love how you think that I lost
Fuck you wherever you are
(Hey sucka nigga, hey sucka nigga)
