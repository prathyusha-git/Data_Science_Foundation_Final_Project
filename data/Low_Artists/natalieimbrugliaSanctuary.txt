Sit down, wait a minute
I thought we were special
This town and everyone in it
Moves a little faster than the underground
No time, time is money
Feeling like a piece of machinery
Let down when I saw you tumble
Falling over pieces of me
I, I wanna be your sanctuary
Set you free, set you free
I, I wanna be your sanctuary
Set you free, set you free
Foot down, turn it around
Don't even know where I wanna go
No sound and tunnel vision
All I need is you on my radio
No time, time is money
Weaving through the traffic to cross the street
Blue sky, 'cause now you're talking
Gotta get the shoes off my feet
I, I wanna be your sanctuary
Set you free, set you free
I, I wanna be your sanctuary
Set you free, set you free
I wanna lead you and follow you
I wanna hold you and keep it true
So many things that I wanna do with you
Last night under the light
I thought we were special
Your smile danced for a while
I'm here to help you to keep it
To keep it
To keep it
To keep it
'Cause I, I wanna be your sanctuary
Set you free, set you free
I, I wanna be your sanctuary
Set you free, set you free
I, I wanna be your sanctuary
Set you free, set you free
I, I wanna be your sanctuary
Set you free, set you free
I wanna lead you and follow you
I wanna hold you and keep it true
So many things that I wanna do with you
