Hearing
Is getting me down
Is getting me down to the disco floor
Hearing
Is wearing me down
It's wearing down from my ears
All those evenings
Spent disappointed on dance floors
I'll add to know
And learn one day

I want to get more from this

I want to get more from this

I want to get more from this
Than you

Sometimes, I'll put up with it
Alright
But I can't even dance the way I might
Where it's just me and you tonight

I want to get more from this
Than you
