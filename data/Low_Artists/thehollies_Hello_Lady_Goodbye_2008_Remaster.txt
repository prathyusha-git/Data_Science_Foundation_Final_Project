I woke up in the morning
Heard a mockingbird sing
Was he laughing at me?
I went to the basin, washed the sleep out my eyes
So I could see
A note on the bed, close where my lover should be
She slipped away in the night
The writing was shaky and with tears on the sheets
I'm sorry we had a fight
So, farewell sweet lover, farewell
I'm sorry we never said goodbye
So farewell sweet lover, farewell
Left with a tear in your eye
Must've been brewing for a very long time
In the wardrobe the hangers are bare
Don't know how you did it, it must've been planned
You even took your favourite chair
So, goodbye my lady, goodbye
You won't find no tear in my eye
So, goodbye my lady, goodbye
Going out tonight to get high
Found myself at Charlie's scene
Drinking all fashions
Sticky painted movie queen
Winked her eye at me
That's how it happened
Diamond shoes, satin dress
Second league bomb, like a splashin'
Flashin' flashin' flashin' flashin'
Woke up in the morning, heard my mockingbird sing
And it was singin' for me
The lady I met last night's here by my side
She's good company
Well, hello sweet lady hello
Good morning with a smile
Well hello sweet lady hello
This lady's gonna make it alright
This lady's gonna make it alright
This lady's gonna make it alright
Lady, lady
This lady's gonna make it alright
Lady, lady
This lady's gonna make it alright
Lady, lady
This lady's gonna make it alright
Lady, lady
This lady's gonna make it alright
