Bright light city's high
Maybe we're gonna fly
Get on the scene
King and Queen
Layin' To the music if you know what I mean
Downtown get around
Searchin' for a mean sound
Itchy feet
wanna dance to the beat
Layin' To the music if you know what I mean
Comin' on strong
won't be long
Reachin' out to where I belong
I'm in my stride
Good music to ride by
Horse riders in the sky
(repeat)
Drinkin' wine from a slipper shoe
Baby can we boogaloo
Move to the right
Slip in tight
Layin' to the music all night
Layin' to the music it's all right
Layin' to the music all night
