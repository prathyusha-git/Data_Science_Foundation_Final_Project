I was jiving along in my big Cadillac
Saw a thumb going up
I said "Driver, go back"
Played her a track from my latest LP
Getting bad vibes, she hadn't recognized me
She said she didn't know me
But my name's been in lights
Giant size neons on the strip every night
The camera man did the best that he can
Still she said "I don't know you"
I just can't understand
I'm a star, yeah
I'm a star (baby, bathe in my glow)
I'm a star, anyway
I was trying to be nice
But I'm not into that
Usually make it without any chat
She was taking it easy
Taking it slow
I said "Come on baby, I'm ready to go"
I'm a star, yeah
I'm a star (baby, bathe in my glow)
I'm a star, anyway
She said "Drop me up here"
And to my surprise
You wouldn't believe it, it was Beverly Drive
Some sort of commotion
What's happening here?
We've arrived at her premiere
I shouldn't be here
She's a star, yeah
She's a star, I didn't know it
She's a star, anyway
Anyway
Anyway
Anyway
