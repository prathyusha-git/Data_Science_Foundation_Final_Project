You're asking the questions but not listening to the answers you get
That must be hard to do
It must be about as hard as forgetting your best friend
You said we'd leave no one behind
So prove what you had wasn't dead inside
But we know
Yeah everyone knows what a selfish prick you've become
And I remember when one single moment was enough
And this is toughest to be because you want it too
It's not that far
At least it didn't seem so from down there
But from up here
It seems that everything I love is so far away
There used to be many things I could hold and touch
And grab onto stormy weather
These days we have each other
(Aaaaaahhhhhhh)

These days

Did you honestly think anything would be different this time around
I'm sure you've got a reason and it's profound
Believe anything as long as it never lets you down
And I remember when one single moment was enough
Convince yourself to jump in because you wanted too
It's not that far
At least it didn't seem so far down there

And we all get love for a moment
And we all get love together
And I remember when one single moment was enough
Convince yourself to jump in because you wanted too
It's not that far
Stormy weather
These days we have each other
