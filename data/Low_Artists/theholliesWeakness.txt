Walk on a lonely street
Don't know where I am
I don't understand
Lost in the wilderness
And apart for you
In the solitude
No matter where I go, I can't forget
Sometimes I wish we'd never met
You're my weakness
In the middle of the night
And I wonder who you're dreaming of
You're my weakness
And it's hard as a fight
Lying here without you
And I'm feeling like the end of the world
The end of the world
My heart is an empty place
For a memories
That I can't erase
Time could be standing still
And for all I know
It forever will
Without my arms around you I feel cold
And even losing all control
You're my weakness
In the middle of the night
And I wonder who you're dreaming of
You're my weakness
And it's hard as a fight
Lying here without you
And I'm feeling like the end of the world
Give me a reason to give up on you
Watching and waiting
The show that the stars, to shine on you
You're my weakness
In the middle of the night
And I wonder who you're dreaming of
You're my weakness
And it's hard as a fight
Lying here without you, lying here without you
You're my weakness
In the middle of the night
And I wonder who you're dreaming of
You're my weakness
And it's hard as a fight
Lying here without you
And I'm feeling like the end of the world
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
