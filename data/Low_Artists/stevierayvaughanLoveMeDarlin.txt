Well now tell me darlin', may I have a talk with you
Whoa, tell me darlin', may I have a talk with you
Because it won't be long before our true love will be through
Whoa, tell me darlin', am I right or am I wrong
I said tell me darlin', am I right or am I wrong
I'm determined to know little girl, you comin' home
Come on home baby
Now now listen to me baby, while I hold your hand
Don't want anything from you but be your lovin' man
Now tell me darlin', may I have a talk with you
Because the words I have to tell you they will linger through the years
I love you honey
