You live your life
You live like an island
Satisfied
You live for the moment
Here you come
You make it look easy
I bet you smile when you sleep
Are you smiling at me?
You live your life
You live like an island
Surrounded by
Water and silence
Mmm, there you go
You make it look easy
I bet you laugh at yourself
Are you laughing at me?
'Cause sometimes anything goes (Anything goes)
When you're looking at me (Looking at me)
And sometimes everything goes (Everything goes)
When you're looking at me
So come on, come on (Come on, come on)
Anything goes (Anything goes)
When you're looking at me
Come on, come on (Come on, come on)
Everything goes (Everything goes)
It's the thing I miss most
Come on, come on (Come on, come on)
Everything goes
Come on
