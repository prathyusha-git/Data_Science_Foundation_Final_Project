Hulk hogan known to keep the thang smoking
Steady fucking with a blonde I think I'm Frank Ocean
(DJ Snitch Bitch)
Be still...
I can't deal with all these sudden motions
Mac high as Sierra
Your updates is frozen
Crouching in the bushes
Like I'm jailposing
That 38 special team
I don't need coaching
You are not a man bitch
You're a fucking token
Giuliani suck a dick
That's the fucking slogan
Black market shawty
Keep the thang on me
Blood on my money
But ain't a stain on me
Ridge racer
No games for me
New money new habits
Make you disappear with no trace that's tragic
Riding down Calvert in a caddy with the ratchet
Pussy call the cops so much
The cops should give him badges
Hold up let me hear that back?
