Hold me tonight
Please, hold me tonight
I know where you live
It's right past the bridge
And I'll walk you home there
If ever you ask me to, but
Did you know that every time we talk
My heart, it beats a little faster?
And did you know that when our eyes meet
My God, it feels like I love you?
Please, hold me tonight
Just hold me tonight
Hold me tonight
Just hold me tonight (night, night, night, night)
Take a look inside
I'm trying to find the courage
But I can't find it yet
And in your eyes
They're glowing in the dark
But I can't look at them yet
So how am I to know
How to approach
Someone like you?
Oh my, it's uncontrollable
The way I'm only thinking about you
So you found the courage
Do you regret it yet?
It's not what you wanted
But I guess it's off your chest
Hold me tonight
Just hold me tonight
So hold me tonight
Please, hold me tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)
'Cause I don't know what l'll do
Instead of loving you
And I don't know who I'll talk to (l don't know who I'II talk to)
I could fake the feeling
I could fake anything you like
But I don't want to (I'm on the outside now)
(I'm on the outside) and I don't know who l'll talk to
(I'm on the outside now) I don't know who I'll cry to
(I'm on the outside) and I don't know what I'll do
(I'm on the outside now) instead of loving you
(I'm on the outside) and I don't know what I'll do
(I'm on the outside now) I don't know who I'll talk to
(I'm on the outside) instead of loving you
(I'm on the outside now)
