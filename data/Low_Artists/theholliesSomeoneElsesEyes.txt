If you're going now, there's nothing more to say
So don't turn around unless you mean to stay
'Cause we've been through this so many times before
It doesn't make it anymore
♪
There never seemed to be the time for explanations
Everything just seems to move so quickly now
But if I never seem to reach your expectations
I'll make it up to you somehow
♪
Don't say goodbye
Don't search for what you'll never find
In someone else's eyes
Don't say goodbye
The answer that you want will never lie
In someone else's eyes
In someone else's eyes
♪
After all this time
I thought you knew me better
Never believed that I
Would ever see you go
Don't say goodbye
Don't search for what you'll never find
In someone else's eyes
Don't say goodbye
The answer that you want will never lie
In someone else's eyes
In someone else's eyes
In someone else's eyes
