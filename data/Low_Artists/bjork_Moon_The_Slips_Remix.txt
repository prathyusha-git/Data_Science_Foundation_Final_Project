As the lukewarm hands of the gods
Came down and gently picked my adrenaline pearls
They placed them in their mouths
And rinsed all of the fear out
Nourished them with their saliva
Now I m all rejuvenated and rested
Now I m all rejuvenated and rested

As if the healthiest past-time

Is being in life-threatening circumstances
And once again be reborn

All birthed and happy
All birthed and happy

Best way to start-a-new
Is to fail miserably
Fail at loving
And fail at giving
Fail at creating a flow
Then realign the whole
And kick into the starthole
And kick into the starthole
And kick into the starthole
To risk all is the end-all and the beginning-all
