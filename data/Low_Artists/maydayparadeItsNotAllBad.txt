I've been running like a freight train
Burning like an old song coming to life
I wish what you were wasn't so bad
So burned like a quick spread shotgun to my life
I've been waiting to fall (feels a lot like going down)
And my loose ends painfully hold on (feels a lot like doubt)
Here's to the heartaches that keep coming back
The lonely ones out of sync with style
The chorus you sing for the birds
The early mornings that feel so hollowed out
I've been building my collection
Storing all the broken pieces inside
I've got boulders wrapped around my shoulders
Think it's over, dead from inside
I've been waiting to fall (feels a lot like going down)
And my loose ends painfully hold on (feels a lot like doubt)
Here's to the heartaches that keep coming back
The lonely ones out of sync with style
The chorus you sing for the birds
The early mornings that feel so hollow
The ones you went and took for the team
So heavy the burden, almost broke your back
The love that isn't here anymore
The good that became of that crash
All the things that bother me are one
They creep along and say hello
Of all the things, I wish I loved
Getting drunk in December
On the floor, what'd you tell him that for, man?
Sister screams hallelujah
Tried to write a song that feels like home
It just feels like California
I know, I know, I know I'm not wrong
I know, I know, I know I'm not wrong
But it feels like it sometimes
Here's to the heartaches that keep coming back
The lonely ones out of sync with style
The chorus you sing for the birds
The early mornings that feel so hollow
The ones you went and took for the team
So heavy the burden, almost broke your back
The love that isn't here anymore
The good that became of that crash
