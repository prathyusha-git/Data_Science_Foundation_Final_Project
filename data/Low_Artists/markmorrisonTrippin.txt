Thinking of you, thinking of me
Thinking of you (thinking of you)
Thinking of me (thinking of me)
Yes, it pains me to say you're gone
But I guess it's for the best, done
Everything I did was wrong
Now there's tears in all my songs
But I loved you and you know it's true
Even though I couldn't keep my cool
And it's killing me to face each day
Dear God, help me, I pray
(Trippin') I be trippin'
(Trippin') thinking of you
(Trippin') can't stop trippin'
Thinking of you, thinking of me
Haven't heard from you in so long (so long)
Wonder how she is getting on (oh)
Is he treating you better than me?
Yes, I'm happy, but I feel empty
'Cause you know that I love you bad (so bad)
All the things he got, I had
But what makes me feel so sad (so sad)
You had the child we always planned
(Trippin') I be trippin'
(Trippin') thinking of you
(Trippin', baby, don't you know) can't stop trippin'
Thinking of you (hmm), thinking of me
(Trippin') I be trippin'
(Trippin') when I'm thinking of you
(Trippin', baby, don't you know) always trippin'
Thinking of you, thinking of me
I'll be trippin', I'll be trippin', I'll be trippin'
I'll be trippin', I'll be trippin', I'll be trippin'
(Trippin') I'm just crying on my own
(Trippin') mark is sitting all alone
(Trippin') yes, I'm crying, baby
Mark is trippin', lady, oh, oh (thinking of you, thinking of me)
(Trippin') I'm just crying on my own
(Trippin') mark is sitting all alone
(Trippin') yes, I'm crying, baby
Mark is dying, lady (thinking of you, thinking of me)
Listen, break it down
(Trippin') ooh-ooh
(Trippin') ooh-ooh
(Trippin', baby, don't you know) ooh-ooh
Thinking of you, thinking of me (ooh-ooh)
Yeah, yeah
(Trippin') ooh-ooh
(Trippin') ooh-ooh
(Trippin') ooh-ooh
Thinking of you, thinking of me (ooh-ooh)
(Trippin') it's all because of, because of you (because of you)
(Trippin') I'm feeling sad and blue (I'm feeling sad and blue)
(Trippin') 'cause you went away
'Cause you went away
Thinking of you, thinking of me ('cause she went away)
Listen
Trippin' on you, trippin' on me
Trippin' on you, trippin' on me
Trippin' on you, trippin' on me
Trippin' on you, trippin' on me
