I understand when you hold my hand so tight
I understand when you kiss and say good night
When we're walking hand-in-hand
Oh baby I understand
Trying to forget isn't an easy task
A little bit of loving is all I ask
When you're away I feel so blue
Oh baby I'm in love with you
Your face haunts me and I know why
It's because of that twinkle in your eye
When you're away I feel so blue
Oh baby I'm in love with you
Oh baby I understand
Oh baby I understand
