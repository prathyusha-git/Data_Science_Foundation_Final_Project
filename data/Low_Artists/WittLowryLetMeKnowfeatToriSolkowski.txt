Quite surprised
Just one look into your eyes
Can change my mind
Then again, I don't mind
I seem to find
All the answers to the questions I don't like
But you make them all alright
Yeah!
I often wonder what really it is that you offer me
At least I feel your touch, even if it's just when you walk on me
Your mind is always elsewhere, it's there, it's on, then it's off of me
I want to feel your depth, but your heart is deaf when you talk to me, uh
I guess that's what we were taught
We open up depending on how many drinks we have bought
He wants your head and it's ironic, doesn't care 'bout your thoughts
You're one more drink away from drowning, feeling empty and lost
But me, I'm no better, she wants to fuck around and I let her
A culture now of "We're together," but was never together
I know you're looking for one night and I've been stuck on forevers
I think it's sad that I'm naive to think that we could do better, but fuck it
I should've known from the start
And even after all this time, I still don't know who you are
There's more to life than likes and hoppin' bars and gettin' high inside your car
You're feeling distant, feeling far, your wall is up, I know it's hard, and so
Tell me something only you know
Give me reason not to go
You have my heart
If I have yours, then let me know
And tell me something only you know
You have feelings you don't show
So how am I supposed to know
If you love me, let me know
Let me know
Let me know
I often wonder what really it is that I offer you
At least you feel my touch, even if it's just when I walk on you

A viscous game that we play
See, nowadays, they say love and hate are one in the same
You let me beat around the bush, until you're sick of my games
It's never fair because you cared and I just transfer the blame
I transfer my pain, a shame to know that you could do better
How selfish, is it my concern as if I'm making you wetter
How selfish, is it you just want me 'cause I make you feel better
And we just chop it up to being drunk, that's wine on your sweater
Alone but together, we always make it less than it seems
It's funny how if you have feelings, you're weak, so we say less than we mean
You hate waiting, we're not dating and not vocal
We're game-playin', I hate sayin', but still hopeful
I'm conflicted, I'm lost in a lot of women
I know our situation's been sticky since the beginning
She left me out in limbo, you deal with my indecision
Don't know if you'll ever love me or love the talent I'm given, but fuck it
I should've known from the start
How can I feel so fucking lonely with your hands on my heart?
Your hands on my chest, you whisper, "What do you want to do next?"
Our generation's taken love out of sex, and so the question is left
Tell me something only you know
Give me reason not to go
You have my heart
If I have yours, then let me know
And tell me something only you know
You have feelings you don't show
So how am I supposed to know
If you love me, let me know
