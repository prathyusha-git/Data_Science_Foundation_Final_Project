Gently spin me around
I'ma spin me around (Peggy, spin me around)
I know it's wrong
Oh, girl, now say they are
Baby, I
You better lock your door, shawty
You better lock your door (door), shawty (shawty)
Niggas gon' slide right in (right in), no warning (no warning)
You got style, keep that shit inside him (huh)
Uh
One deep in the back (back)
Black man can't depend on sympathy (yeah)
I feel like hip-hop tried to put a hit on me
Pussy niggas put me in a box, it's belittling
Repo'd, these beats keep coming in kilos (kilos)
Switch styles, make 'em feel like Manti Te'o
In this game, the police use cheat codes (ya heard me)
Huh, I feel like I just beat a case (huh)
Whole different styles in my other hand
If you been here a while, you relate
I stay feeding my kids, I'm they government
Baby Reagan, I'm crack on the case (on the case)
Trickle down, get that shit off my chest, bang
Step off the stage, I feel so hot (damn)
No weeks to relax
On the road, I'm a redhead stranger
You know, I gotta keep the smoke for the haters
You know we only do with these majors, conceal
No faces, no case, no deal
Mind vacant, new champ, new heel
This flagrant, better yet so real
I love 'em
Huh, I feel like I just beat a case (case)
Whole different styles in my other hand
If you been here a while, you relate
I stay feeding my kids, I'm they government
Baby Reagan, I'm crack on the case (on the case)
Trickle down, get that shit off my chest, bang
Step off the stage, I feel so hot (damn)
(Bitch nigga, rich nigga, trick nigga, talk shit)
Oh, you better lock your door, shawty (three)
He's gon' slide right in, no warning
You got style, keep that shit inside him, ooh
