Underneath our feet
Crystals grow like plants
Listen how they grow
I'm blinded by the lights
Listen how they grow
In the core of the Earth
Listen how they glow
Crystalline
Internal nebula
Crystalline
Rocks growing slow but
Crystalline
I conquer claustrophobia
Crystalline
And demand the height

We mimic the openness
Of the ones we love
Daft 'til our generosity
Equalizes the flow
With our hearts
We kiss our quartz
To reach love

Crystalline
And demand the lights
Octagon, polygon
Pipes up an organ
Sonic branches
Murmuring drone
Crystalizing galaxies
Spread out like my fingers

It's the sparkle you become
