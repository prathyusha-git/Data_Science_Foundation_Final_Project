It is an emergency
In order to survive as species
We need to define our utopia
The Paris Climate Accord is a modern utopia
Impossible to imagine
But overcoming our environmental challenges
Is the only way we can survive
We have to imagine something that doesn't exist
Carved intentionally into the future
And demand a space for hope
Weave a matriarchal dome
Let's imagine a world
Where nature and technology collaborate
And make a song about it
Let's make a musical mock-up
For our destination
And then move into it
After disasters
In all mythologies around the world
One captures the spirit
With a flute and starts anew
Carved out of the first fauna
We arrive on a new island
With mutant species
Unknown hybrids of birds and plants
Our past is on loop
Turn it off
Let's be intentional about the light
Imagine a future
Be in it
