Say what you want
Think what you like
You won't persuade me
My flame will keep on burning
I know it's not over
My eyes don't see
My ears don't hear
All those stories
Going in circles
Circulating
That it's over
She gave to me, I gave to her
A token of our love
On the understanding that we'd give them back
As a message that we're through
I still got mine and I ain't got hers
That's how I know for sure
No need to say no more
I don't wanna hear no more
Your move was a loser and she won't forget
How you used her
Oh, I know she'll refuse you
You're a two-timing loser
And I won't move over
She gave to me, I gave to her
A token of our love
On the understanding that we'd give them back
As a message that we're through
I still got mine and I ain't got hers
That's how I know for sure
No need to say no more
I don't wanna hear no more
Say what you want
And think what you like
You won't persuade me
My flame keeps on burning
And I won't move over
My eyes don't see
My ears don't hear
All those stories
Going in circles
Circulating
Your move was a loser and she won't forget
How you used her
Oh, I know she'll refuse you
You're a two-timing loser
And I won't move over
