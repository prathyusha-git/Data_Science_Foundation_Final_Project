(Mustard on the Beat)
I been knowing you for long enough
Damn, I need you right now
You can take your time, don't have to rush
This might take us a while (yeah)
I left all the doors unlocked and you said you're on your way
When you get here don't just say a word, got no time to play
I know you think that you know me
But you ain't even seen my dark side
It's as if it's you only
So baby, do it right, do me right
We can go over time
We can move fast, then rewind
When you put your body on mine
And collide, collide
It could be one of those nights
When we don't turn off the lights
Wanna see your body on mine
And collide, collide
Baby, it's all yours if you want it, all yours if you want it
Put it down you can want it, tonight
Said it's all yours if you want it, all yours if you want it
Put it down you can want it, let's collide
Wakin' up, she on it
Good love in the mornin'
Get on top my cojones
I pleasure you for the moment
This don't come with no warranty
You want it but can't afford it
My world is different than yours
You're opinion of me is glory
Glorifying in all these foreign
Back to future, and DeLorean
You ain't used to feelin' this important
Cars imported, girls imported
Insubordinate, get deported
Baby, check my inventory
Got a whole lot in store for ya
Birkin bags, purple tags
I can put a whole lot of shit on blast
Vera Wang, Balenciaga
Baby, you ain't never too fly for that
I talk a lot of shit (shit), 'cause I can back it up (back it up)
She know I'm the shit (shit), so baby back it up
We can go over time
We can move fast, then rewind
When you put your body on mine
And collide, collide
It could be one of those nights
When we don't turn off the lights
Wanna see your body on mine
And collide, collide
Baby, it's all yours if you want it, all yours if you want it
Put it down you can want it tonight
Said it's all yours you can want it, all yours can you want it
Put it down you can want it, let's collide
I know that this is love when we touch, boy
You got my heart
And can't nobody make me feel like you do, boy, like you do
