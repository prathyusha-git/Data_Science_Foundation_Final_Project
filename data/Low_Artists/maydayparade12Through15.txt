(How you are fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning
How you are cut down to the ground
You who weakened the nations
I will ascend above the heights of the clouds
I will be like the Most High
Yet you shall be brought down to Sheol, to the lowest depths of the pit)
Hey, the walls keep coming down but I'll stand, brave
Love is just an empty word you, say
I found loyalty and it was, pain
And you hate, God keeps coming down
'Cause you're afraid, Lucifer just might be your middle name
You're the only angel that got away
♪
And we're all alone now
With nothing to stand in our way
Don't swear that it's over, if love is our secret
I know you won't keep it
We're taking this easy
'Cause darling, that's what dreams are made of
This story is probably made up
So why don't you go back to sleep?

Hey, the walls keep tumbling down but I stand, brave
Maybe I'm the one who's in your, way
I'm the only reason love got away (love got away)
And we're all alone now
With nothing to stand in our way
Don't swear that it's over, if love is our secret
I know you won't keep it
We're taking this easy
'Cause darling that's what dreams are made of
This story is probably made up
So why don't you go back to sleep? (Just like we never did)
Why don't you dream about me? (Just like we wanted to)
'Cause I'm the reason you're alone now
You're blaming everything on your hometown
Why would you say that?
♪
Oh, oh, oh, I think you're better off when you're on your own
You say to keep me close
'Cause I'm the closest thing that you've ever known
You said the problem's in your heart
But the problem's who you are
So leave me alone now
I'd rather be lonely when I scream and shout, and let it out
We're taking this easy
'Cause darling that's what dreams are made of
This story is probably made up
So why don't you go back to sleep? (Just like we never did)
Why don't you dream about me? (Just like we wanted to)
Cause I'm the reason you're all alone now
Quit blaming everything on your hometown
Why would you say that?
