why can't you give her room?
respect her spatial needs
i feel you compress her
into a small space
with clairvoyance
she knew what you needed
and gave it to you
now her desires are repressed
arrows in the flesh
when she found your love
her nature bowed her head
she surrendered
she renounced the world for you
now she's poisoned by demands
you cannot answer
why this sacrifice?
now she regrets the whole thing
a delayed reaction
when she left her craft voluntarily
for your nest for your love
did you understand?
appreciate
build a bridge to her
initiate a touch
before it's too late
say the words to her
that will make her shine
tell her that you love her
your generosity will show
in the volume of her glow
