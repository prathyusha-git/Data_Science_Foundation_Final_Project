This is a warning
I can feel it in the air
I know I shouldn't be here
I should be sleeping in my bed
I've got a bad, bad feeling I've been running my mouth
The more I speak, the more her clothes come off
I've made my bed
But I don't belong here
I'm a sinking ship
I'm that cut that won't heal right
Let's be honest
♪
You might think I'm good as gold
I'm that fire that warms your soul
I will let you down
(Down, down)
♪
Another warning
Another sad day will pass me by
No, I never told you
You were the last thing on my mind
Well, I got a bad feeling it's meant to be
It's like you knew
I'm sorry for the way that I gave up on you
Best friends stick together
Just like best friends always do
I'd rather cross my heart than make this right
I swear these things to you
I'm a sinking ship
I'm that cut that won't heal up
Let's be honest
♪
You might think I'm good as gold
I'm that fire that warms your soul
I will let you down
♪
And I'll bet, I'll bet you believe every lie I ever told
And I swear, I swear
We can make it if we just forget everything that we know
Bang, bang, bang
There goes giving your heart away
Bang, bang, bang
There goes giving your heart away
Bang, bang, bang
There goes giving your heart
Your heart, your heart
I'm a sinking ship
I'm that cut that won't heal right
Let's be honest

You might think I'm good as gold
I'm that fire that warms your soul
I will let you down
(You down)
(You down)
