So what, I guess you're what they call Monday
You remind me of all the things I hate about myself
Don't watch that, you'll get over it someday
Find it hard to talk sometimes, let alone ask for help
So what, I guess you're what they call Monday
You remind me of all the things I hate about myself
Don't watch that, you'll get over it someday
Find it hard to talk sometimes, let alone ask for help
Systems to sell, your senses to rot
(Systems to sell, your senses to rot)
And right all the wrongs that you just forgot
(And right all the wrongs that you just forgot)
Put through pain and the people we done
(Put through pain and the people we done)
Joining in arms to go through it preferred
(Joining in arms to go through it preferred)
So what, I guess you're what they call Monday
You remind me of all the things I hate about myself
Don't watch that, you'll get over it someday
Find it hard to talk sometimes, let alone ask for help
So what, I guess you're what they call Monday
You remind me of all the things I hate about myself
Don't watch that, you'll get over it someday
Find it hard to talk sometimes, let alone ask for help
So what, I guess you're what they call Monday
You remind me of all the things I hate about myself
Don't watch that, you'll get over it someday
Find it hard to talk sometimes, let alone ask for help
Uh, I never dared to doubt
Felt this way longer than I can count
So that feeling can't catch me as long as I don't stop
And I move, if stop, I lose
This pain I choose not to take this to Tuesday
Every day stains like it's toothpaste
At this rate, my life going to waste
New day, gotta watch my mind race
I guess you're what they call Monday
You remind me of all the things I hate about myself
Don't watch that, you'll get over it someday
Find it hard to talk sometimes, let alone ask for help
So what, I guess you're what they call Monday
You remind me of all the things I hate about myself
Don't watch that, you'll get over it someday
Find it hard to talk sometimes, let alone ask for help
I guess you're what they call Monday
You remind me of all the things I hate about myself
Don't watch that, you'll get over it someday
Find it hard to talk sometimes, let alone ask for help
