Relax take your shoes off
Relax what's your hurry
As the days go hurrying-scurrying by
you'll find yourself finding a reason
to watch the world go by
Relax take your shoes off
Relax don't you worry
As the world goes heltering-skeltering by
the sun will still wander across the sky
And if you stay with me
we'll grow wiser gracefully
