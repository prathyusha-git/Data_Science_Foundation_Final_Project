So, I hope this has helped you determine the origin of that bad taste in your mouth
Make sure you rinse it out
Then never eat it again (I wish that I was someone else)
Then never eat it again, again
Make sure you rinse it out
Then never eat it again
Make sure you rinse it out (ooh)
Then never eat it again (ooh)
Make sure you rinse that bad taste
Out of your mouth (ooh)
Then never eat it again (ooh)
Then never eat it again
