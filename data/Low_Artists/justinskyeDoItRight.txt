Look at you
What are you tryna prove?
Like we don't know the truth
How do you get confused?
Baby, you don't mean it and I don't need it
All of that talk keep it, keep it
You know me, ain't the only one I see
Ain't the only one I need here
But if you play your cards right, hmm
Baby, you're mine, only for the night
Can do what I like?
Wanna know if you can do it right, yeah
You ain't gotta tell me who you been with
I don't give a fuck 'bout where you go
I've been dodging all your calls
Laid up with another nigga that you know, yeah
We gotta act like this
Something we did before, yeah
I'm just tryna get you vibing
If you got a problem, maybe you should go
Walked in the club, headed straight to the back
Can you grabbing my ass, oh boy, no you act
Then I don't get attached, give me tucked in a cup
'Cause I know it ain't love
But you know good as fuck, yeah
You know me, ain't the only one I see
Ain't the only one I need here
But if you play your cards right, hmm
Baby, you're mine, only for the night
Can do what I like?
Wanna know if you can do it right, yeah
It's about time, why don't we go
Know you been waiting on my queue so
Siting on top, make my ass roll
I'ma show you what I like, struck my ego
You know me, ain't the only one I see
Ain't the only one I need here
But if you play your cards right, hmm
Baby, you're mine, only for the night
Can do what I like?
Wanna know if you can do it right, yeah
You know me, ain't the only one I see
Ain't the only one I need here
But if you play your cards right, hmm
Baby, you're mine, only for the night
Can do what I like?
Wanna know if you can do it right, yeah
