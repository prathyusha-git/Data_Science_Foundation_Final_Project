Never thought I would right my wrongs
Here I am with the life I've loved
Dad, are you listening?
I said, "Dad, are you listening?"
No I've not been the greatest kid
I ran fast after troubles I did
Dad are you listening?
I said, "Dad, are you listening?"
Look at us now, where we are
You and me said we'll go far
I just wanted you to know
Wherever I go, you go

Wherever I go, you go

Wherever I go, you go
No one can make it out alive
But you taught me to live my best life
So mom, are you listening?
I said, "Mom, are you listening?"
Yeah you told me to always be kind
Never leave anybody behind
So mom, are you listening?
I said, "Mom, are you listening?"
Look at us now, where we are
You and me said we'll go far
I just wanted you to know
