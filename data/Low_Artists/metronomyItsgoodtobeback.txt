It feels so good to be back
But our love is gone
It's our favorite song
Oh, no
I could've made a picture
To tell you all about it
Let's do another circuit
Let's go around the houses
Oh, life
Got so hard, I couldn't bear
Oh, yeah
♪
It feels so good to be back
But our love is gone
It's our favorite song
And even when I'm wrong
I still care
Yeah, I still care for you
It feels so good to be right
So unreal to be alive
Oh, no
Let's go, wake up the children
To tell them all about it (about, about it)
How you appeared in color
And left no doubt about it (about, about it)
Oh, life
It's a cross that we all bear
Oh, yeah
Oh, life
It's just something in the air
Oh, yeah

It feels so good to be back
But our love is gone
It's our favorite song
And even when I'm wrong
I still care
Yeah, I still care for you
It feels so good to be right
So unreal to be alive
Oh, no
Yeah, I see the world
But sometimes not what's right in front of me
So hold me tonight
I'm so excited, I can hardly breathe
I keep breathing though
