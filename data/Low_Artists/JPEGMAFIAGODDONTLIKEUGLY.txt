Be blessed by the lord, I know I know I know
Dawg, pick a location
Promise 'bout your pride and shock up when I put that pen to pavement
Y'all can keep that dickriding, I don't need that
'Cause real niggas only feel you when they see cheques
These days the bar so low for weird shit
Had to stop sharing
I'm so peerless, beats get you off your bum ass like Baron
White boys be on they burners, who they think they scaring?
Black men who hate themselves don't like what I be sharing
Steady bumping niggas who don't own what they be blaring
It's apparent, you niggas got failed by your parents
Stay on my side like Sharon
Cut your season off as soon as you get to airin'
God don't like ugly, and just look how you appearing, nigga
You bitches all blue notes, no Harold Melvins (Facts)
Look, I get it, y'all need a image, y'all don't care 'bout talent
I know that you won't admit it, but you love my stylin'
Got a clip at one of my shows, you see me free and wilin'
I'm a young Frank Zappa, y'all Sarah Palin
Just simple, basic, no balance
Some niggas is washed-up, y'all need to leave the island
Everybody can't be Beyoncé, bitches be wilding
Somebody gotta be Michelle, I guess you ain't survivin', huh
Shut your goofy ass up
Oh yes, lord, ble-
Oh, lord, I-
He's gonna bless you
He's gonna bless you, ah
