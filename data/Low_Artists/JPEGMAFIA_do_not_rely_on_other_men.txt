I hear you went down, down, down, down, down
I hear you went down
I hear you went down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Did you go down?
I had to get on my Pac shit, I don't wanna start shit
These rappers is regular food
I bought my bitch some compartments
She thicker than Cartman, she can't fuck no regular dude
Uh, say that
Uh, say that
Wanna cry on the bus or the Maybach?
If you hate me, my nigga, just say that
I don't know who told these wiggas
That actin' like niggas was ever the vibe or the mood
You know that I know that ain't really you
'Cause the blacker the image, the whiter the roots
Uh, say that
Uh, say that
Wanna cry on the bus or the Maybach?
If you hate me, my nigga, just say that
We can take this shit the veteran way
The Kimber, the Glock, the miniature Drac'
I ain't goin' nowhere, I'm right in your face
Make your shorty give neck 'til her neck in a brace
Uh, say that
Yeah, say that
Wanna cry on the bus or the Maybach?
If you hate me, my nigga, just say that
Just to be clear, I'm the cornerback
We push through on that pass, make you fumble that
I am off the LT, set it up with smack
Back to back on these bars like some battle rap
You ain't slinging the rock like Candlemass
Need to stay in the crib with your gamer pass
Wanna cry on the bus or the Maybach
If you hate me, my nigga, just say that
I hear you went -
I hear you went -
I hear you went down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Did you go down?
I hear you went down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down
I hear you went down
This how I run when I give it up
Got no juice, listen up
I pray to Allah, Exo
I let that K-pop, put that on my soul
I pray to Allah, Exo
I let that K-pop, put that on my soul
I pray to Allah, Exo
I let that K-pop, put that on my soul
I pray to Allah, Exo
If the cops come around, "No sé qué pasó"
Cut your head off like I'm Sinaloa
The shoes fits on you, then you Cinderella
First one act a ass, we gon' pin the tail
I'm fucking that ho, bitch, she Donatello
Be for real
I pray to Allah, Exo
I let that K-pop, put that on my soul
I pray to Allah, Exo
I let that K-pop, put that on my soul
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
I hear you went down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
I hear you went down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
I hear you went down, down, down, down, down
I hear you went down
