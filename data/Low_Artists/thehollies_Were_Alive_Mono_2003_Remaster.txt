Feeling free
Across the ocean we go sailing
On an on into the sunshine
On our way
Life is so good to us now
Feeling good, feeling free, we're alive
Blue skies above
Everything's right as we're going on our way
The future looks bright
You and me together at last
Feeling good, feeling free, we're alive
Lovely feeling, the wind blows through your hair
As we're sailing through life without a care
Look around and feel the freedom
All around us
It is ours just for the taking
Nearer now, to the islands we go
Feeling good, feeling free, we're alive
Lovely feeling, the wind blows through your hair
As we're sailing through life without a care
Faster now, across the surface
Of the water
Keep ahead
All life will catch up
Everyone would like to feel like we do
Feeling good, feeling free, we're alive
Feeling good, feeling free, we're alive
Feeling good, feeling free, we're alive
