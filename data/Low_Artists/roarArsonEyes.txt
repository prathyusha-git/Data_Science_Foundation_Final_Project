This is how I built a mountain with my failed attempts to love you
It became the color dust,
and like a copper fox on rust, would hide too
I would murder hours, hands inside the Earth
Pulling perfect stones, who
When I begged them to convince you of their shape
Only seemed to refuse
Save all your effort that cannot be measured
Currently you're just a man selling vapor
