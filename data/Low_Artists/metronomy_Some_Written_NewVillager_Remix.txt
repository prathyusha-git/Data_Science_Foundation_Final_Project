I tried to catch you up, but I'm too late
So as I finish up your lemonade
I'll send a message, some written, one sung
You left a number that's eight numbers long
It's time to liven up your lemonade
I'll send a message, some written, one sung
You left a number that's eight numbers long
There's no getting over, so I'm done
I'll forget the number and I'm gone
There's no getting over, so I'm done
I'll forget the number and I'm gone
There's no getting over, so I'm done
I'll forget the number and I'm gone
