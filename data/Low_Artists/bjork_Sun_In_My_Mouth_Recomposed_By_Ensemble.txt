I will wade out
'Til my thighs are steeped
In burning flowers
I will take the sun in my mouth
And leap into the ripe air
Alive with closed eyes
To dash against darkness
In the sleeping curves of my body
I shall enter fingers of smooth mastery
With chasteness of sea-girls
Will I complete the mystery
Of my flesh
Will I complete the mystery
♪
Of my flesh
My flesh
