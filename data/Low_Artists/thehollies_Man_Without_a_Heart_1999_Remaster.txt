Man in a room, can't you see what you did?
Pick yourself off the floor, it don't suit you so don't be blind
One lonely with four walls closing in
It's a room without any door
You've been on your own since she told you to go
I'm telling you why and what for
You're a man without a heart
Just a lonely man without a heart, yeah
Just a lonely
Man, can't you see what you did to yourself
Thinking it was so big at the time?
I could have told you but I wasn't there
You shout her the wrong kind of line
You're a man without a heart
Just a lonely man without a heart, yeah
Just a lonely
Pick yourself off of the floor
It don't suit you to be in that frame of mind
Try to be more like a man with respect
Get on the right track, don't be blind
You're a man without a heart
Just a lonely man without a heart, yeah
Just a lonely
Man in a room with four walls closing in
It's a room without any door
You've been on your own since she told you to go
I'm telling you why and what for
You're a man without a heart
Just a lonely man without a heart, yeah
Just a lonely
Man in a room, can't you see what you did?
Pick yourself off the floor, it don't suit you so don't be blind
