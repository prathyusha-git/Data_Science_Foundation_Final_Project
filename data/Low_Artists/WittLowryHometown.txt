Yeah, remember how the music sounded under streetlights on late night drives
And how the moon would illuminate the passenger side
It's twenty to five, I just passed Deepwood Drive
I wish I knew then I was livin' in my simpler times
Sometimes I'd walk around Nevers, headphones on in the rain
'Cause songs always sounded better than the thoughts in my brain
See, last year taught me how much in a year things change
When I'm in town now and look around, nothin's the same, damn
I don't know what they even mean when they're tellin' me I need to come home
Feels like yesterday I packed the car with everything that I own
Know myself less than I know those roads
But my hometown no longer feels like home
I'm back in town, just not for long
The only time that I come back is to visit my mom
I traded oak and maple trees for a couple palms
Remember back when I would rap songs at Tyler and Sean's
Their downstairs felt like Madison Square
There was prolly never more than three or four of us there
Nobody cared, but we never cared
I guess I always knew the thief of happiness is when you start to compare
Now I'm in town, and feel like a tourist
This is where my mom and dad had their first mortgage
This is where my dad passed, not to sound morbid
Lately learnin' that the little things are more important
Places I would visit daily now are so different
My old house no longer even looks lived in
I can't get back all the holidays I've been missing
You really don't know what you miss until you're at distance
Until you, ugh, now
I don't know what they even mean when they're tellin' me I need to come home
Feels like yesterday I packed the car with everything that I own
Know myself less than I know those roads
But my hometown no longer feels like home
Mom's talkin' 'bout movin' now out of state
Lookin' for a place that has a little more space
So I may not be comin' back, and that's somethin' I need to face
All the memories we made here are slowly startin' to fade
And my mom got remarried, she says she's changin' her name
And my sister got engaged, and she plans on doin' the same
I'll be the last one in my family with my family name
Now who the fuck is even family? Guess the question remains, 'cause
I don't know what they even mean when they're tellin' me I need to come home
Feels like yesterday I packed the car with everything that I own
Know myself less than I know those roads
But my hometown no longer feels like home
I don't know what they even mean when they're tellin' me I need to come home
Feels like yesterday I packed the car with everything that I own
Know myself less than I know those roads
But my hometown no longer feels like home
All these photos are moments frozen in time
They teleport me to a place I can only see in my mind
Remember summer nights, chasin' our whiskey down with some wine
And in the winter, how the air would combine with the smell of pine
Remember sittin' at the park all alone with a broken heart
In my car spendin' hours just starin' up at the stars
Back when validation came from a friend, and not from a chart
I cherish where I'm from from afar, damn
