I have placed a glass egg
Above us floating
An oval ovule in a dark blood-red sky
Carries our digital selves
Embracing and kissing
My skin-mud dense by you
I anchor our darks, I anchor our darks
I sleep with one eye open
Watching our sub-selves
The keel of our ship
These obstacles are just teaching us
So we can merge even deeper
Into our own personal mineral
Fuse alloy, ship ahoy
The hostility a broken heart endures
The velocity of that injury
Is returned to the world
With the same grin showing teeth
When I was a girl
I felt love was a building
I marched towards
But deadly demonic divorces demolished the ideal
Now with your romantic intelligence
The sensual tenderness
We dissolve old habits and place a glass egg
Above us floating
In a dark blood-red oval void
Our love-making avatars
In a shell
