Feeling kinda low inside
Longing to be by your side
To see you there before my eyes
All this love I feel has no disguise
But what's in a love when you feel so denied
I can't count all the times I've tried
Something ain't right
But I'm never gonna let that something
Make me stop without a fight
No, something ain't right
And it's hurting my mind
Just a little too much
And bringing me down
Something, something ain't right
Sitting in the dimmest of light
In my room with a view of the night
In the time it took for you to call
You left me holding onto nothing at all
I'll accept what I can but I can't understand
Why you want it to end this way
Something ain't right
But I'm never gonna let that something
Make me stop without a fight
No, something ain't right
And it's hurting my mind
Just a little too much
And bringing me down
Something, something ain't right
I'll accept what I can but I can't understand
Why you want it to end this way
Something ain't right
But I'm never gonna let that something
Make me stop without a fight
No, something ain't right
And it's hurting my mind
Just a little too much
And bringing me down
Something, something ain't right
