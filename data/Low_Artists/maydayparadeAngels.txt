Three years of something I call love
When the phone calls and photographs are never enough
To save a heart that's been broken, so close to screaming
This can't be happening, I must be dreaming
What's the worst that could happen? I never knew
When all I ever wanted was to get away from you
But now the possible's impossible and I can't refuse
Grab all your dreams and raise all your glasses
Let's toast to the lucky ones
To the girl that just broke my heart
I can't breathe after all that you've told me
You took my heart and made me melt again
I could never imagine we'd end up this way
After all that we went through now I'm fighting through the pain
It's like this heart that's been broken, so close to screaming
Was ripped from my chest and I can't stop the bleeding
Now we all fall for the bad ones
They'll just break us 'cause we're so young
Dumb and vulnerable
Young and vulnerable
Here's a toast to the lucky ones
To the girl that just broke my heart
I can't breathe after all that you've told me
You took my heart and made me melt again
You ripped apart these pages (I can't breathe)
Our book was overrated (after all that you've told me)
This brings up all these questions
Tell me what just happened (you took my heart and made me melt again)
I'll say
I put your picture in a frame
That stands at the side of my bed
So whenever I get sad I can stare at your face
And overplay that I won't forget
When all I remember is talking is cheap
And you're eyes were expensive
And God only knows when I'll come to my senses
Now I can't breathe at all (now I can't breathe at all)
Here's a toast to the lucky ones
To the girl that just broke my heart
You ripped apart these pages (I can't breathe)
Our book was overrated (after all that you've told me)
This brings up all these questions (you took my heart and made me melt again)
(You ripped apart these pages) I can't breathe
(Our book was overrated) After all that you've told me
You took my heart and made me melt again
Tell me what just happened
