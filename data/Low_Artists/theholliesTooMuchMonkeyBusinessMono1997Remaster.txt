Runnin' to and fro, hard workin' at the mail
Never fail with the mail, still they get my posted bail
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be in by ten
Someone talkin' to me, tryin' to run me up a creek
Says, "You can buy it, come on, try it, you can pay me next week"
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be in by ten
Blond haired good lookin', tryin' to get me hooked
Want me to marry, get a home, settle down, write a book
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be in by ten
Workin' in the fillin' station, too many checks
Check the windows, check the tires, check the oil, goin' again
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be in by ten
I been to Yokohama, been fightin' in the war
Army bunk, army chow, army crew, army coat
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be in by ten
Telephone something wrong, dial gone will mail
Hours to the operator tellin' me a tale
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be in by ten
Too much monkey business for me to be in by ten
Too much monkey business for me to be in by ten
