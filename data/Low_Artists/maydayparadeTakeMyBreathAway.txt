You can try and run but trouble follows you
Hate me for all the things you put me through
Hey Jade, did you sleep the whole night through?
You're looking for the way out
I'm just outside before this burning house
The flames go down, but no one makes it out
I'm terrified 'cause I've lost my fear of doubt
But the war is over now
So break me down, if it makes you feels alright
Shake me off, if it helps you sleep at night
Hold me down in the river, take my breath away
Who am I to judge? Its written on your face
So take me for every moment that its worth
Hey Jade, do you think we'll make it through?
Are you looking for the way out?

Hold me down in the river, take my breath away
Take my breath away
