True love is gone, I's been played for a fool
True love is gone, I's been played for a fool
I'm turnin' the tables on you
You've been playin' dirty pool
You said you'd call the shots darlin'
All your friends thought that was cool
You said you'd call the shots darlin'
All your friends thought that was cool
Yeah, but when you shot at the eight ball baby
I knew you were playin' dirty pool
Well they say that life, life is a game of give an' take
Well they say that life, life is a game of give an' take
I'm tellin' you one thing right now little baby
I won't be the one to pay for your mistakes, oh, no baby
