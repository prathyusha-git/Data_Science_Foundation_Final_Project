You're so damn beautiful tonight
So how can I make you love me?
Well, it's 6 a.m., I'm awake again
And I can't get you out of my head
Well, you dressed so tight and you danced all night
You took my heart and left me for dead
But I don't even know your name
'Cause you didn't give that much away
Will I ever feel the same again?
Now I'm caught up in the games you play
You're so damn beautiful tonight
How can I make you love me?
I'm so blinded by your light
How can I make you see?
That I would walk a thousand miles
To find my way to you
You're so damn beautiful
And I wanna make you mine
I thought I saw your face in a crowded place
But it was just a shadow of you
And now I'm all alone, waiting by the phone
I'm hoping that my message got through
But I didn't even ask your name
Even though we danced the night away
Suddenly you left without a trace
Before I had the chance to say
You're so damn beautiful tonight
How can I make you love me?
I'm so blinded by your light
How can I make you see?
That I would walk a thousand miles
To find my way to you
You're so damn beautiful
And I wanna make you mine
Oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah
But I don't even know your name
'Cause you didn't give that much away
Will I ever feel the same again?
Now I'm caught up in the games you play, hey, yeah
You're so damn beautiful tonight
How can I make you love me?
I'm so blinded by your light
How can I make you see?
That I would walk a thousand miles
To find my way to you
You're so damn beautiful
And I wanna make you mine
Make you see
I just wanna make you love me
You're so damn beautiful
I don't know your name
You're so damn beautiful
You drive me crazy
You're so damn beautiful
