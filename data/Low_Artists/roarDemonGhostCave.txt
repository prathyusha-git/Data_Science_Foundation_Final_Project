At the end of your life
You were worried about how I would live mine
Even when you were alive
You can choose not to shine, in the darkest of times
It's okay to want to die
But you can't hide from
It's okay to want to die
But you can't hide from every subsequent new life
I can love you everyday
But I can't guarantee that you will be safe
Still you can't be destroyed
By anything else, not even yourself
Though you really tried to do all you could
Though you really tried to do all you could
Though you really tried to do all you could
Though you really tried to do all you could
