We go out when the dance is through
Tonight I'm celebrating but it means nothing without you
I think I see someone I know
I'm hiding in my drink and making friends with the window
This weather couldn't get much worse
I'm having conversations with the lines I've already rehearsed
To myself
I carry two hearts
You never wanted, never wanted me to hold you like I could
They carry me through
And there's a choir getting started
But I've burned that bridge for good
I believe with my heart
This moment is a loaded gun
The wrong involuntary move and we've killed the fun
The funeral, it brings us back
We've been ready many years all dressed in black
If you tell me that your life is done
Tomorrow in the morning you can wake up and help someone
Or yourself
I carry two hearts
You never wanted, never wanted me to hold you like I could
They carry me through
And there's a choir getting started
But I've burned that bridge for good
I believe with my heart
You smile while the symphony plays
And tell me music is your only escape
Well I don't hear it, I don't hear it anymore
What do we do now?
(This love it speaks, tells a different story)
I thought you were the end of the rainbow
It was such a long road
I thought of you and kept pushing and pushing against everything
That was thrown at me
What's the point of taking punches
If you never get the chance to hit back?
What's the point of taking punches?
What's the point of doing anything?
I carry two hearts
You never wanted, never wanted me to hold you like I could
They carry me through
And there's a choir getting started
But I've burned that bridge for good
I believe with my heart
You smile while the symphony plays
And tell me music is your only escape
Well I don't hear it, I don't hear it anymore
What do we do now?
(I thought you were the end of the rainbow)
What do we do now?
This love it speaks, tells a different story
This love it speaks, tells a different story now
This love it speaks, tells a different story
This love it speaks, tells a different story now
