I see a desert spine
From my window
I hear a broken mind
When I lay my head on the pillow
♪
In a dream my shadow came to me
Wearing the skin of my enemy
Telling me
Sometimes things can seem like an eternity
♪
I saw myself inside
Of my own life
My liquid crystal light
Had frozen me for a time
In a dream my shadow came to me
Wearing the skin of my enemy
In a dream my shadow came to me
Wearing the skin of my enemy
Tеlling me
Sometimes things can seem likе an eternity
