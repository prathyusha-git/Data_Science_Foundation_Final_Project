What are we good for? I think you know
What are we good for? I think you know
In seven years, only one goodbye that meant much to me
Down and out, and I'm fading fast, I can't keep it all together
If every fairy tale could probe the night and take me into there
Or grab my hand and tell me what's the difference between
Heaven and Hell, 'cause I can't tell
You'll be my angel through it all
Dressed as a girl, you'll be part of this world
We'll love like fools again
I wanna thank you for your card, 'cause Hallmark says it all
I'm sorry if I keep on trying to forget
If you really love me, then write about how you never wanna live without
This broken boy who keeps on trying to forget
Looks a lot like home, a better place to be
A terrifying feelin', I can't see you
We're always off and then on again
And they say that I might be cursed for a while
And I feel it setting in into my head again
Watch me forget my life
How does it feel when you're all alone?
I won't answer when you call
I don't wanna hear the things I think about
The things I can't live without
I wanna thank you for your card, 'cause silence says it all
I'm sorry if I keep on trying to forget
If you really love me, then write about how you never wanna live without
This broken boy who keeps on trying to forget
(Trying to forget, trying to forget, trying to forget)
I'm trying to find my way home
Well, there's nothing worse than walking by myself
Oh, I'm tired of believin' we could ever heal these broken dreams
When you're still sleepin' in someone else's bed (oh, here we go)
I wanna thank you for your card, 'cause nothing says it all
I'm sorry if I keep on trying to forget
If you really love me, then write about how you never wanna live without
This tortured boy who keeps on trying to forget
What are we good for? I think you know
What are we good for? I think you know
What are we good for? I think you know
What are we good for? I think you know
