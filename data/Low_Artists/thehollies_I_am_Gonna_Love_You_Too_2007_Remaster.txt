You're gonna say you miss me
You're gonna say you kiss me
Yes, you're gonna say you love me
'Cause I'm gonna love you too
I don't care what you told me
You're gonna say you hold me
Yes, you're gonna say you love me
'Cause I'm gonna love you too
After all another fellow took you
But I still can't overlook you
I'm gonna do my best to hug you
After all is said and done
You're gonna say you miss me
You're gonna say you kiss me
Yes, you're gonna say you love me
'Cause I'm gonna love you too
I'm gonna love you too
I'm gonna love you too
Gonna love you too
I'm gonna love you too
After all another fellow took you
But I still can't overlook you
I'm gonna do my best to hug you
After all is said and done
It's gonna happen some day
You're gonna see things my way
Yes, you're gonna say you love me
'Cause I'm gonna love you too
You're gonna tell me sweet things
You're gonna make my heart sing
Yes, you're gonna hear those bells ring
'Cause I'm gonna love you too
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you too
I'm gonna love you
Yes, I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you too
I'm gonna love you
Yes, I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you too
