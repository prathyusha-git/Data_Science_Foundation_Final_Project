Peggy! Peggy!
Big-big-big-big-big-bi-bi-bi-bi-big booty hoes, up with it
You niggas is bitches, I don't wanna kick it
Peggy, I aim for the fences, you niggas don't swing, you stackin' up misses
(Big booty hoes, up with it)
You tweetin' your business, we can't do no business
Dick-ridin' is expensive, if you need a image, then baby, don't listen
Keep bumpin', who-the-fuck-is-that?
Fake plug talkin' Tubi rappers
Got a machine behind 'em, and still they can't fill up capacity with they raps
Baby mama be a rap snack, grew up white, now they act black
She got issues with her father, I had issues with my barber
She off all of these drugs, coke in her butt, R.I.P. Aaron Carter

I do what I do with a vengeance, Pegasus been had style
Show out with class, give me detention
Y'all do a lot for the mention
I spaz in other dimensions
'Bout to take it to another level, my attraction came with a pension
Now some niggas gotta respect or they gettin' retired
Or step in the room, every nigga inspired
Or niggas just hate 'cause they shorty admire
Now tell me what's flame to the fire

Do we have a problem? Huh?
Thank God I didn't cheat with that bitch yet
Get it in, get it out, get it off my chest
I'm G.I. Joe fallin' down them steps
I'm a Head Honcho, I need a pistol
Make a mistake, I pay it in crypto
You got the swag of a nigga from Chaturbate, you wanna aggravate
Stick talk, let the chopper elaborate
