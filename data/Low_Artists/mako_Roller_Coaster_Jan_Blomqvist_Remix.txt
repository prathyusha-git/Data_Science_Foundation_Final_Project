What a night
Made you cry
Think I might've lost my appetite
Take a deep breath and let it lie
Second I said goodbye
I could feel my stomach drop like a roller coaster
Get me off the ride
No appetite to be loved by someone else for a long, long time
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
To be loved by someone else for a long, long time
It's a roller coaster ride
To be loved by someone else for a long, long time
It's a roller coaster ride
To be loved by someone else for a long, long-
Silver tongue devil eye
I think I just droppеd my alibi
Take a deep breath and let it liе
Second I said goodbye
I could feel my stomach drop like a roller coaster
Get me off of this ride
Oh, get me off this ride, ride, ride
Oh, off this ride
It's a roller coaster ride
