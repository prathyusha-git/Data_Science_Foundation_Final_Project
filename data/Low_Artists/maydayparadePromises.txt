I woke up this morning and knew something wasn't right
I could tell by the way we didn't sleep well last night
The air is so cold, and the sun began to rise
All I wanted was a moment, but the moment flew by
That's when you, you closed your eyes
That's when I, I had to say goodbye
Promises, promises, I'm done with all of it
In solitude where I walk alone
The heart of it's ominous, clear-cut, and prominent
I miss you more than I did before
In our struggle, will you find the best in me
In spite of everything?
Sooner or later, enough is enough
Like a house full of flowers, we all wilt and dry up
The air is still cold, and the sun will always rise
All I wanted was a moment, but the moment flew by
That's when you, you closed your eyes
That's when I, I had to say goodbye
Promises, promises, I'm done with all of it
In solitude where I walk alone
The heart of it's ominous, clear-cut, and prominent
I miss you more than I did before
In our struggle, will you find the best in me
In spite of everything?
