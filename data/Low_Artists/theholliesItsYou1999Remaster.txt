Don't raise your voice to me and don't be unkind
I'm just a foolish man who doesn't know his mind
There is a reason I don't love you like I should
And it's you
Yes, it's you
Oh, it's you
Try understanding I'm a simple man at heart
The way you carry on, I think we'll drift apart
I can't afford to live the way you want us to
So, it's you
Yes, it's you
Oh, it's you
Why can't I love you?
Why can't I love you?
'Cause I'm not the kind of man you are looking for
If everything is wrong we'll go our separate way
You'll have to find a man who does just what you say
To break up is a shame, it spoils the chance we had
But it's you
Yes, it's you
Oh, it's you
Why can't I love you?
Why can't I love you?
'Cause I'm not the kind of man you are looking for
If everything is wrong we'll go our separate way
You'll have to find a man who does just what you say
To break up is a shame, it spoils the chance we had
But it's you
Yes, it's you
Oh, it's you
