She looks from side to side
The tear drops fill her eyes
As once again she hears the sound of shouting
turns to the window pane
Funny there's rain again
Inside her head she hears the sound of shouting
They are fighting again
All she feels is cold and pain
She don't know whose side to take
Mother's or Father's
She can't know that soon they'll part
That they broke each other's heart
They are breaking up, but she don't understand it
She leaves the room in fright
Each time they start to fight
She runs up to her bed
But there's no sleeping
♪
Clings to her teddy bear
But even teddy bear can't stop her weeping
Little girl dry your eyes
Your Ma and Pa one day will put you wise
Little girl don't you cry
You'll understand what happened by and by
