If I was an NBA player, I'd be Dillon Brooks, but worse
I'm Deebo, we are not equal
They all miss like they Shaq at the free throw (skrrt)
Scrape my plate, never shat where I eat though
Pray to God that I never slave to the evil (swear to God)
Dios mio, sippin' Modelo
Spit like I'm starvin', I'm finna let my ribs show
Your win-loss lookin' Jake Paul, we face off and make you face God
Huh, who that runnin' they trap? Bro, you ain't built like that (huh, huh)
Y'all ain't drop for WAP, I ain't fulfilled like that (huh, huh)
50 beat switches a minute, they gon' put me in a Guinness (huh, huh)
I need the maximum digits, blame it on capitali-
You get hit with a facepalm (a facepalm)
It's a new year, but I'm still fake calm (still fake calm)
.45 always there like State Farm
When they can't read you like a book (uh-huh)
They gon' try to attack what you stand on
I'ma take off even if I land wrong
And take everything I can get my hands on (run it up)
Huh, who that runnin' they yap? Bro, you ain't built like that
Huh, huh, herb-ass niggas just rap, I ain't fulfilled like that
Huh, huh, 50 beat switches a minute, they gon' put me in a Guinness
Huh, huh, I need the maximum digits, blame it on capitalism
I hate when niggas be stressin' 'bout what you be doin'
More than they worry 'bout they own shit
I hate when these bitches be beggin' your boy for some cash
And then turn around and say, "Eat the rich"
They get mad when niggas do it for themselves 'cause they parents is still chippin' in
Oh, you mad? Your bitch play follow the leader after you unfollowed your bitch, huh
The underground filled with my Gohans
These niggas be scammin' on GoFund
Nigga said he fucked my bitch, I said, "Which one?"
My top five, me and four Dylans
