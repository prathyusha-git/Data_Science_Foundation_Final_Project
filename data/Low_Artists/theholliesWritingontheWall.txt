I've seen the writing on the wall
What's the answer to it all
My eyes are open
No need to stall
I've seen the writing on the wall
How I loved you
When I first saw you
The transformation was there to see
I gave my heart, my body and soul
When I first saw you
Oh, how I loved you
Games, games, games - games people playin'
There's always a loser
This time it's me
Oh how I love my inspiration
Such a sad story
The game we played
How could sweet love
Turn to sour love
How could I've lied
One lie too many
Why should we be separated
You know that I still want you
You know that I still want you
Seen the writing on the wall
What's the answer to it all
My eyes are open No need to stall
Seen the writing on the wall
