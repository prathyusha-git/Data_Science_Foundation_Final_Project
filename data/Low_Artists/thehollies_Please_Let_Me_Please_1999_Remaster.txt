What did you do today? You turned the other way
I tried to kiss you, but you laughed in my face
It's a one thing to do knowin' that I love you
Don't be to hasty; the tables will turn
Please, please, please, let me please ya
Please Let Me Please ya. Please let me, Louise
Please, please, please, let me please ya
Please Let Me Please ya. Please let me, Louise
Why are you different now? Did I hurt you somehow?
If so, then tell me, but don't laugh in my face
If I said something strong, I'll admit I was wrong
Come on and tell me, but don't laugh in my face
Please, please, please, let me please ya
Please Let Me Please ya. Please let me, Louise
Please, please, please, let me please ya
Please Let Me Please ya. Please let me, Louise

I always treat you right. Why do you wanna fight?
Go if you want to, but don't laugh in my face
If I try kissin' you, don't make me out a fool
Come and tell me, but don't laugh in my face
Please, please, please, let me please ya
Please Let Me Please ya. Please let me, Louise
Please, please, please, let me please ya
