What if I told you, everything we built will slowly fade away?
And if I hold you
I swear everything I touch it breaks
But it you close your eyes and take my hand
We could learn from our mistakes
If you jump, I'll follow
If you jump, I'll follow

What if I told you, everything that's gold is sure to fade
If I hold you, what if I hold you 'til we're old and grey?
But it you close your eyes and take my hand
We could learn from our mistakes
If you jump, I'll follow
If I jump, will you follow?
We could fly away, set a course straight into the sun
Take a holiday, stake our claim up there in the stars
So fly high, like diamonds in the sky
Burn bright, my satellite

We dreamed of airplanes on a jet way, poised to take you away
So when I tell you, I won't mislead you
I stay grounded when you needed space
But it you close your eyes and take my hand
We could learn from our mistakes
If you jump, I'll follow
If I jump, will you follow?
We could fly away, set a course straight into the sun
Take a holiday, stake our claim up there in the stars
So fly high, like diamonds in the sky
Burn bright, my satellite
Let's go!
