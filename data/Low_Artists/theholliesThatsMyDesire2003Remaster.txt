To spend one night with you
In our rendezvous
And reminisce with you
That's my desire
Oh whoa whoa whoa
To go where gypsies play
Down in some dim cafe
And dance till break of day
That's my desire
Oh whoa whoa whoa
To sip a little glass of wine
And gaze into your eyes divine
To feel the touch of your lips
Pressing on mine
To hear you whisper low
Just when it's time to go
Cheri, I love you so
That's my desire
Oh whoa whoa whoa
That's my desire
Oh whoa whoa whoa
That's my desire
