(Your voice so clear)
What kind of rappin' is this?
(Your gentle ways)
(So clear, your voice so clear)

Now I'm lookin' all over the world
Yeah, yeah, lil' bitch, I been rapping like this
(So clear)
(Your presence near)
Uh, are you feelin' me now?
Big dog, make 'em follow the script
Like LL when I'm back in the house, uh
Lil' bitch, I been rappin' like this
Marion Barry, I'm takin' a hit
He carried a cross, I carry the clip, like
What kind of rappin' is this?
I pray to him for a sound, like
Please, don't deliver me now
Weak men always got so much issue with me
It just happens, it's bound, uh
Lil' bitch, I been rappin' like this
Covered in money, they thinkin' I strip
My pop was a ghost and my partner's ain't shit (No)
I rap like I'm one bar from slittin' my wrist
You one bar away from me splittin' your wig
Say a few words and jump back in the pit
What kind of rappin' is this?
(Your gentle ways)
(So clear, your voice so clear)
Yeah
Now I'm lookin' at this one
Now I'm lookin' at that one
Now I'm lookin' all over the world
Yeah, yeah, lil' bitch I been rapping like this
Niggas thinkin' I strip

(Your gentle ways)
