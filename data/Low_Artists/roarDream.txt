I think I know what you want
I think I know what you need
I should be making you happy
Lord knows I'm trying
But the things you can't see
Make it harder to breathe
This is just what you asked for
When you fell asleep
You can't see the forest if the trees
Never stop burning
It sounds like a joke when told to me
I should be learning
Feeling ashamed of an empty threat
I can still change if I want to
Dreams never come true
No one else can help you
No one else can help you
No one else can help you
