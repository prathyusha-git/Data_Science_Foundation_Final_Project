If you knew, Peggy Sue
Then you know why I feel blue
Without Peggy, my Peggy Sue
Well, I love you girl
Yes, I love you, Peggy Sue
Peggy Sue, Peggy Sue
Oh, how my heart yearns for you
Oh, Peggy, my Peggy Sue
Well, I love you girl
Yes, I love you, Peggy Sue
I love you, Peggy Sue
With a love so rare and true
Oh, Peggy, my Peggy Sue
Well, I love you girl
I want you, Peggy Sue
Peggy Sue, Peggy Sue
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty Peggy Sue
Oh, Peggy, my Peggy Sue
Well, I love you girl
Yes, I need you, Peggy Sue
I love you, Peggy Sue
With a love so rare and true
Oh, Peggy, my Peggy Sue
Well, I love you girl
And I want you, Peggy Sue
