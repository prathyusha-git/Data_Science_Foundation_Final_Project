You must believe me
No matter what the people might say
You must believe me
Darling it just didn't happen that way
No, no it just didn't happen that way
You come home
With something on your mind
Tell me darling
Why are you crying
I said be serious
No time for fun
You're tryin' to tell me
Something that I've done
The things you heard
Couldn't be denied
But before your opinion
Listen to my side
You must believe me
No matter what the people might say
You must believe me
Darling it just didn't happen that way
No, no it just didn't happen that way
Oh oh
Oh oh
You come home
With something on your mind
Tell me darling
Why are you crying
I said be serious
No time for fun
You're tryin' to tell me
Something that I've done
The things you heard
Couldn't be denied
But before your opinion
Listen to my side
You must believe me
No matter what the people might say
You must believe me
You must believe me
You must believe me
