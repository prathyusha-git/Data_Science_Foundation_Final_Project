Look, I brought your present back to Tiffany's, yeah
Was for your birthday, before you
Hurt me the worst way, I wonder what's gettin' into me
I wonder if your drink's in his mouth, tasting like victory
I wonder why at night every lie still plays like a symphony, I
Can barely focus, you never cared, I was broken
Been hurting since my dad passed, bet you wouldn't have noticed
'Cause you were busy blacked out, stumblin', losin' focus
Surrounded by all that's hopeless in life that you never chose
And here I go again, preachin' like I know who you are
Too busy stuck inside your phone to ever notice the stars
I miss the nights we'd sing Adele in your car
And had you wetter than the tears that you would cry if we're discussing your scars
I know your demons carry weight, don't know what it's like to be you
Know myself from the bottom, don't know what it's like to need you
You lied from the beginning, don't know what it's like to read you
My dad passed away and that day I flew out to see you
Remember? I'm thinkin' back to December
And how we talked about forever, now we talk less than never
I can't lie, sometimes I find myself re-reading your letter
I'm not saying I was perfect, still, I wish I woulda treated you better
Better, better, better for me
How could you think this would be
Better, better, better for me?
How could you think this would be?
On and on and on again, I fear these voices in my head
That tells me it's all lies and I should let you go
On and on and on again, I hear this voice inside my head
That tells me it's alright and I should hold you close
If you don't know how many times
I forgive you just so I can keep you by my side
I don't know why we waste our time
Spending all our nights in this gorgeous lie
Now maybe time was just against us 'cause you had just been broken when I met ya
I tried to take your pieces, and put you all back together
But the truth is coming out, I feel your void when we're together
Not sayin' that I was better, you drink to relieve the pressure
I know, let's keep it real
I know you loved to lie, but do you find you love me still?
'Cause he will never love you, like I loved you and I promise that is real
You can delete all of our pictures, but you can't delete your feels
You should be easy to replace
But every meaningless conversation, I see your face
I'm tryin' to fill this hole in my heart that you fuckin' made
I'm trippin', should've known that I would never find my happiness in all of these women
I need to find it in myself, that's for damn sure
Almost been a year since I got you from the airport
Crazy how time flies, I'm tryin' to hold on while
I wait for your car like, "Come out at the bar at night"
Now how could this be?
Better, better, better for me?
How could you think this would be?
Better, better, better for me?
How could you think this would be?
On and on and on again, I fear this voices in my head
That tells me it's all lies and I should let you go
On and on and on again, I hear this voice inside my head
That tells me it's alright and I should hold you close
You don't know how many times
I forgive you just so I can keep you by my side
I don't know why we waste our time
Spending all our nights in this gorgeous lie, yeah
