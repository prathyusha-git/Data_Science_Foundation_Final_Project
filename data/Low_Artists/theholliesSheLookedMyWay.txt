All around me the music was loud
Playing sound for the noisiest crowd
Did I care
I didn't even know why I was there
Sick and tired of the same old scene
Had my share of that same old routine
Like before I kept on hoping there was something more
Then anyone could see there was a change in me
When she looked my way
A simple glance and she had made my day
She looked my way
Was there a chance she wanted me to stay
Why didn't I go to her
Why didn't I speak to her
Why did I let her go away
Looked again but I found she had gone
So my heartache just kept going on
Through the night my heart and I remembered that first sight
I thought I found the love that I'd been dreaming of
chorus
When she looked my way
A simple glance and she had made my day
She looked my way
Was there a chance she wanted me to stay
She looked my way
A simple glance and she had made my day
