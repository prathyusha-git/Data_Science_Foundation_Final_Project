I'm starting to crave it, I'm starting to need it
I'm not gonna fake what I know I believe in
Because you are, are, are, are holy water
I'm dying of thirst, no, I'm not gonna make it, oh
I'd sell you my soul
If only my heart wasn't empty
I'd give you my love
If all I got was a heartbreak
Please save me from hell
'Cause I've got one foot in the grave
If I made you my God
The Devil may cry

I've got too many sins
I've got too many problems
With one touch of your skin
You'd know how to solve them
Because you are, are, are, are holy water
I'm dying of thirst, no, I'm not gonna make it
I'd sell you my soul
If only my heart wasn't empty
I'd give you my love
If all I got was a heartbreak
Please save me from hell
'Cause I've got one foot in the grave
If I made you my God
