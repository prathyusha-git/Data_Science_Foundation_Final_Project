Oh, I take what I want
I'm a bad go-getter, yeah
Yes, I am
I'm never a loser
And I'm never a quitter, yeah
Oh no
'Cause I take what I want
Yeah baby, I want you
Nobody but you, child
I've been watching you walk by
And I never said a word
Not one word
But now I'm ready to get you
And I'm gonna make you my girl
My loving girl now
'Cause I take what I want
Yeah baby, I want you
Nobody but you, child
I'm gonna pick you up now
Carry you away, yes, I am
So you better pack up now, baby
Packing up today, here I come
Just a big bad man
When you see me walk away, baby
You'll be holding my hand
'Cause I take what I want
I'm a bad go-getter, yeah
Yes, I am
And now I'm ready to get you
And I'm gonna make you my girl
My loving girl now
'Cause I take what I want
Yeah baby, I want you
Nobody but you, child
Nobody but you, you, you
Nobody but you, child
Oh, listen to me, I got nobody but you now
