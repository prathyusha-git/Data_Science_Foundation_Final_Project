I wish I could remember every second we had
I know I tried to count 'em all one by one, one by one
But you don't get 'em back, you don't get 'em back
Take every memory we've ever had
Oh, I wanna live 'em all one by one, one by one
And I swear that I'm not gonna lose you now
I'll keep you in my life somehow
And even when the lights go down, down
I could never lose you now
And even though we're not so close, yeah
Maybe you can pick me up still
'Cause I can't stop falling down
I can't stop falling down
And I'm not gonna lose you now

Oh, I'm not gonna lose you now

Oh, I can still remember all the lessons you gave me
I hope that I can live 'em all one by one, one by one
Don't you go looking back, there's no looking back
And I don't mean to open every picture I saved, yeah
I'm only tryin' to visit with you one by one, one by one
And I swear that I'm not gonna lose you now
I Need you in my life somehow
And even when the lights go down, down
I could never lose you now
Even though we're not so close, yeah
Maybe you can pick me up still

I can't stop falling down
