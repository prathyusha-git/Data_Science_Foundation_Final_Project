Anytime you need her, she come through
Turn on the lights, I'm looking for her
I'm looking for her, I'm looking for her
Look, I ain't really into flashin', I feel like an accident, I'm never chose
They be duckin' points for passion, I feel like it's corny if you ain't on code
Niggas be on my dick for nothing
I be like, "What happened to these niggas, bro?"
Like niggas be really goin' through it, but there's a better way to let the people know
People say I'm never present, I ain't messy, I'm just focused on my goals
'Cause either on or off the drugs, my energy is Tony powderin' his nose
And either on or off the drugs, my energy is Don Magic with the hoes
'Cause I been boxin' with the drugs, I got a good chin like James Toney
Niggas be puttin' your boy in a box
They be actin' like cops, I could never be phony
She be actin' like a thot, I hope it's all an act 'cause she deserves a Tony
I'm either on or off the drugs, K hole or buzz, I cannot atone
'Cause either on or off the drugs
Her voice plays in my ear like I'm on hold ('PEG, 'PEG, 'PEG, 'PEG-)
The first one was good with the beats
The second one put me up in the deep
The third one was sick, no disease
The fourth, I had to rush it to complete ('PEG, 'PEG, 'PEG, 'PEG-)
I don't have no base, it's not a secret
Ain't no happy house, we takin' beatings
The streets and my mind is filled with demons
That's why I be eatin' these bitches like Sara and Tegan
And 'cause distractions hittin' every season
These niggas just rhyme, no reason
It's not just a façade that I can see
Or standin' up for guys that don't believe
I'm Michael Jackson dancin' in the mirror
The only one who can't see me is me
The only one who can beat is me
Warriors, I'm CP3
When I see you, it's TTG, fuck 'em, we don't take EBT

God, I pray my son don't be this weak
God, I pray my daughter won't be this weak, fuck

Some of you niggas be talkin' right out of the side of your neck
And I can't believe that they be gassing these lil' hoes
Some of you niggas be sittin' around all day
Hatin' on niggas they never met, I just feel sad for you, lil' bro
Baby, you know when I'm wildin' out, I make a mess
I keep the cannon like Nick, put my bitch in a vest
What did that last one contribute but pussy and stress?
Nothin'
(Turn on the lights) I'm looking for her
