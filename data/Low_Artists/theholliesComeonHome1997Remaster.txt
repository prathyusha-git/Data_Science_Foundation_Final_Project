I'm telling you, I'm telling you
I'm telling you to come on home
I've been told many times about you
About your lies, that you've never been true
Now I found out
You're left here on your own
Now I found out
But I'm telling you, I'm telling you
I'm telling you to come on home
In the future, darling, be true
How many times has this happened to you?
I've been told many times about you
About your lies, that you've never been true
Now I found out
You're left here on your own
Now I found out
But I'm telling you, I'm telling you
I'm telling you to come on home
Come on, baby, now
Telling you, I'm telling you
I'm telling you to come on home
Come on, come on, come on, now
Telling you, I'm telling you
I'm telling you to come on home
Oh, baby, now
Telling you, telling you
I'm telling you to come on home
