I know, I know, I know, I know (hahaha)
Shit is just, fuck it (yeah)
Long Island shit
Let's do it
A scrub is a guy who thinks he's fly
And also known as a buster (yeah)
Always talkin' 'bout what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass, so
No (Whoa), I don't want your number
No (Oh), I don't wanna give you mine and
No (Yeah), I don't wanna meet you nowhere
No, I don't wanna none of that, baby
A scrub checkin' me and his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me
I'm lookin' like class, and he's lookin' like trash
Can't get wit' a deadbeat ass, so
I don't want no scrub
Scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
It ain't hard to see, he
