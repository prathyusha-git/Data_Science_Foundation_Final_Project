Move a little closer and I'll prove
That I have something that you crave
But you know all about it
Climb, give me a minute of your time
And I can figure out a way
To make it worth your while
'Cause I am drawn to you and
Everybody stares when you walk in the room
But you keep disappearing
Have I told you you're my cameo
Want you lover, baby
Here we go, cameo
Leave or you will find yourself in need
Of something more than you can take
And it'll drive you wild
I was a slave to every signal that you gave
You had me ready for the chase
And there was no denying
'Cause I am drawn to you and
Everybody stares when you walk in the room
But you keep disappearing
Have I told you you're my cameo
Want you lover, baby
Here we go, cameo
I want you in it, give me a minute
I want you in it
Have I told you you're my cameo
Want you lover, baby
Here we go, cameo
