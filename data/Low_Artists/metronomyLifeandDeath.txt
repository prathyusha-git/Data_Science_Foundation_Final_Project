I don't know life and death
Wait until nobody's left
Save the date in your diary
Out of touch, out of my depth
You held a mirror to my breath
There's a glimmer of hope, yet
♪
Oh, my God (oh, my God)
It's life and death
♪
Oh, my God (oh, my God)
It's life and death
♪
Take some pictures of me
But then forget about them
♪
It was fun, what I did
Got a job, had some kids
See you in the abyss
I don't know, life and death
But get a go of both, I guess
Neither one I fear less
♪
Oh, my God (oh, my God)
It's life and death
Oh, my God (oh, my God)
It's life and death
Take some pictures of me
But then forget about them
