I ain't gone 'n' give up on love...
Love won't give up on me
I ain't gone 'n' give up on love...
Love ain't gone 'n' give up on me
Every tear that I've cried...
Only washed away the fear inside
Now I, I ain't gone 'n' give up on love
Every beat of my heart...
Pounds with joy and not with pain
Every beat of my heart...
Pounds with joy and not in vain
And although those are painful memories...
Only brought me to my knees
I was just given up on love
Little Johnny Taylor told us so long ago
What about the midnight cryin'...
Wo that cheatin' and lyin'
What about the price that will...
Oh surely be paid
Those that gave up on love...
Love will have it's day
I ain't givin' up on love
I ain't gone 'n' give up on love...
Love won't give up on me
I ain't gone 'n' give up on love...
Love won't give up on me
Every time I cry...
Love just won't let me be...
Won't set me free
