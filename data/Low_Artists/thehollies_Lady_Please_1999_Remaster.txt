Well, there's them that do and them that don't
Them that will and them that won't
I've been trying to get you for a long time
For a long time
When our eyes meet at each different place
How I got to know your face
Think that I have loved you for a long time
For a long time
Lady please, I'm not a man of many words you see
If you lie with me, you can't sleep
Lady please, if in the future there's some other man
I will understand and I won't weep
♪
As our bodies fill my lonely room
A room that once was filled with gloom
Know that I will love you for a long time
For a long time
♪
For a long time
Lady please, I'm not a man of many words you see
If you lie with me, you can't sleep
Lady please, if in the future there's some other man
I will understand and I won't weep
♪
As the morning sun lights up our bed
You are there to stroke my head
Know I'm going to love you for a long time
For a long time
Lady please
Lady please
Lady please
