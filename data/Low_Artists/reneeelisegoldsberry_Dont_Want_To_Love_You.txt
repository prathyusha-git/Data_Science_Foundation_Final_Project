Someday, someday, I'll be so much better, baby
Call you when I get there
Till then maybe, don't think I can see you, baby
I know you think it isn't fair
Always, always, you are where I'd run to baby
To make the pain go away, yeah
So what do I do now that it's you, makes it rain?
I don't wanna hold on so damn tight
To somebody else hands
I wanna wake up, what I come to
I don't wanna love you
Don't wanna keep wondering why, why
Tell myself that you just need time
I wanna wake up, what I come to
I don't wanna love you
Tell me no lies
Does she make you happy, baby?
Thought I was the only one
I was wrong
So goodbye, goodbye
Can't say I won't miss you, baby
But the damage is already done
How do you choose to let yourself lose someone?
I don't wanna hold on so damn tight
To somebody else hands
I wanna wake up, what I come to
I don't wanna love you
Don't wanna keep wondering why, why
Tell myself that you just need time
I wanna wake up, what I come to
I don't wanna love you
I always wanna call my own that I don't have
Trying to find myself a home in the bitter grass
Always betting on a love that won't last
Tell her we've spoken
Don't say I was crying, baby
Can you promise me that?
♪
My heart isn't broken
It's beating but it's dying baby
Ever since you gave it back
I don't wanna hold on so damn tight
To somebody else's hands
I wanna wake up, what I come to
I don't wanna love you
Don't wanna keep wondering why, why
Tell myself that you just need time
I wanna wake up, what I come to
I don't wanna love you
No, I don't wanna love you
No, I don't wanna love you
Always wanna call my own what I don't have
Trying to find myself a home in the bitter grass
Always betting on a love that won't last
