Don't you know it's just a matter of time?
Say that you will stay by my side
That your love for me has got be real
You just got to know that's how I feel
You don't know what I know
Don't you feel what I feel?
When I hold you tight
When I hold you tight
That your love for me has got be real
You just got to know that's how I feel
Don't you know what I know?
Don't you feel what I feel?
When I hold you tight
When I hold you tight
Can't you see?
You're no longer mine
You're no longer mine
You're no longer mine
