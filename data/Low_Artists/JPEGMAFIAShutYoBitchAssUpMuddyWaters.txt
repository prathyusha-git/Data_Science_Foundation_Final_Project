Shut the fuck up
I'm talkin to-
I don't rap circles round niggas, I do figure eights
Rent free in nigga's heads, shook the real estate
Mistake will make the razor blade hit the dinner plate
Same story- (shut the-)
Bitch you been erased
Lights, camera, action, close the slate
When tables turn, I'm making records break
Bumpin' to the DJ, I make his needle skip the plate
Rikki rikki, check, check, check it (why you still talkin' to me? Shut the fuck up)
You satire, can't fire some Al-Qaeda
I'm like the, only lighter in Rikers
You vampires, always bitin' and suckin' shit
It's nothin', no discussion, good conscience you try to touch him
On my momma, I was broke (oh, you got to shut the fuck up, I'm talking to)
Like a promise from a fat bitch that had no more McDonalds
I come from when the work was honest
It was either gettin' shot at or-
♪
I just hit the bottle to drown out the chatter
All these voices in my head had my brain all scattered
How I got more ill, when I stop poppin' them pills
Now I'm slangin' propane like I'm King of the Hill
Man, it's over for that lame shit, the ending is near
Is you finished? Are you d-
You're just sayin' a bunch a nothin'
Like you speakin' in tongues
Showed up uninvited, they didn't want me to come
Feel like daddy home, they all my sons
♪
Uh, forgive me father for slayin', slinkin' through muddy waters
Forgive they daughters, they barkin' at me, I'm raw doggin'
These drug addicts attached to me like I'm Tom Holland
Swing on these actors, these rappers faker than Andy Kaufman
Truman show up with the truth and get shoveled in a coffin
I shit you not, feel like Shia LaBeouf in all these problems
You smack your bitch up like Prodigy when you do it darlin'
I smack my bitch ass to Prodigy when we do it doggy
Uh, it's Black AOC, no matter what they try to say they can't K.O me
Yo bitch got me off the molly and them BZDs
She said, "Baby, just let me ride," like D-R-E
How the fuck you thirty-pluses postin' on KTT?
I made real fuckin' Gs like Eazy-E
I wish these nerds would come outside so they can 343
And post they wanna-be Black ass on Say Cheese TV, nigga
Forgive me father for slayin', slinkin' through muddy waters
Forgive they daughters, they barkin' at me, I'm raw doggin'
These drug addicts attached to me like I'm Tom Holland
Swing on these actors, these rappers faker than Andy Kaufman
Truman show up with the truth and get shoveled in a coffin
I shit you not, feel like Shia LaBeouf in all these problems
You smack your bitch up like Prodigy when you do it darlin'
I smack my bitch ass to Prodigy when we do it doggy
