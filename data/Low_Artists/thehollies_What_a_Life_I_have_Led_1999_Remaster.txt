There never was a man so doggone mean
I wore only black and my eyes were green
And I can tell you now that I'm very old
I'd kill any man for a piece of gold
Oh what a life I've led
I've been a real bad man and I oughta be dead
Oh what a life I've led
I've been real mean man, full of cheating and lying
Left a lot of men dead and a lot of girls crying
Yes I did
I rode into Dodge on a sunny day
I went there to steal all the railmen's pay
And when I left town all the streets ran red
I had ten grand in gold, and three guards lay dead
Oh what a life I've led
I've been a real bad man and I oughta be dead
Oh what a life I've led
I've been real mean man, full of cheating and lying
Left a lot of men dead and a lot of girls crying
Yes I did
I was a bad man with a heart made of stone
If you were a wise man, you would've left me alone
I've lived all my life, such a lonely one
Just me and my horse and a fine six-gun
I've lived and I've loved and I knew great pain
But I know now I'd do it over again Singing
Oh what a life I've led
I've been a real bad man and I oughta be dead
Oh what a life I've led
I've been real mean man, full of cheating and lying
Left a lot of men dead and a lot of girls crying
Yes I did
Oh what a life I've led
I've been a real bad man and I oughta be dead
Oh what a life I've led
I've been real mean man, full of cheating and lying
Left a lot of men dead and a lot of girls crying
Yes I did
