This wheel's on fire
This wheel's on fire
This wheel's on fire
If your memory serves you well
We're gonna meet again and wait
So I'm gonna pack all my things
And sit there for it gets to late
No man alive will come to you
With another tale to tell
And you know that we shall meet again
If your memory serves you well
Wheel's on fire
Rollin down the road
Let's notify my next of kin
This wheel shall explode
If your memory serves you well
I was gonna confiscate your lace
And wrap it up in a sailors knot
And hide it in your case
If I knew for sure that it was yours
But it was so hard to tell
And you know that we shall meet again
If your memory serves you well
This wheel's on fire
This wheel's on fire
This wheel's on fire
If your memory serves you well
You'll remember you're the one
That called on me to call on them
To get your favours done
And after every plan had failed
And there was nothin' more to tell
You knew that we should meet again
If your memory serves you well
This wheel's on fire
This wheel's on fire
This wheel's on fire
