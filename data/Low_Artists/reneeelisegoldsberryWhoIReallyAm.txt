Introducing a big sensation
A critic darling
A revelation
Well, she may be new to you
But she's no beginner
A triple threat and a trophy winner
But take a little dig and you might get dirty
Cause the bones are buried
Deep
Losses that won't let me sleep
Heavy burdens I miscarry
And it's scary to me
My biography doesn't tell all of who I am, who I really am
Who I really am, who I really am, yeah
Introducing a queen of proper
A leading lady a loving mama
Well she might be new to you, but she's not new to this
Proverbs 31, that's how virtuous
But dig a little bit and you might get dirty
Cause the bones are buried
Yeah
Just dig a little bit and you might get dirty
But the gold is buried deep
So much joy it makes me weep
Learning that the Lord will carry all that's scary to me
My biography doesn't tell
All of who I am, who I really am (really am)
Who I really am, who I really am, yeah
Who I am
The gold is buried
