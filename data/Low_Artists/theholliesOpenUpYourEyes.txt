Open up your eyes looking at the people
Wouldn't it be nice if they were always smiling
Open up your eyes looking at the people
Wouldn't it be nice if they were always smiling smiling
Wake in the morning
Look out of my window
down on the street as the people pass by
Wonderful faces awake but asleep
rushing around with appointments to keep
rushing around with appointments to keep
Bald-headed banker with bowler on head
Credit for debit but still in the red
Schoolgirl in pigtails and freckly nose
trying to remember her Latin prose
trying to remember her Latin prose
chorus
Open up your eyes open up your eyes
Open up your eyes open up your eyes
Isn't it surprising what you'll find
Open up your eyes open up your eyes
What are they thinking
What's on their minds
Are they all looking for something to find
Decreasing circles running around
searching for something they've already found
searching for something they've already found
chorus
Open up your eyes looking at the people
