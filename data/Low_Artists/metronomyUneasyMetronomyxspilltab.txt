Pull me down, don't need to take no vows
You're reaching farther now than I have ever known
Pull me down, don't need to take no vows
You're reaching farther now than I have ever known
'Cause I'd stand in a line just to meet you
Scribble your name on my wall just to get through
Spending all of my time like I can't do
Anything other than wanting to want you
Anything other than wanting to want you
Pull me down, don't need to take no vows
You're reaching farther now than I have ever known
And I'm a sucker for the evenings and the seasons
And every touch that stays between us, can't believe it
I just wanna be the reasons that you throw it all away
'Cause I'd stand in a line just to meet you
Scribble your name on my wall just to get through
Spending all of my time like I can't do
Anything other than wanting to want you
Anything other than wanting to want you
You say that that makes you uneasy
But babe, I'm the one that's in touch with my feelings
Either way, seems we both are agreeing I'm the one you've been needing
I'm the one you've been needing
Pull me down, don't need to take no vows
You're reaching farther now than I have ever known
Pull me down, don't need to take no vows
You're reaching farther now than I have ever known
And I'm a sucker for the evening
