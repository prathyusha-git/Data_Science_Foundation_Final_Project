I said I'm not with the plan, ayy
I'm like "Bitch who is your man?" Ayy (You think you know me)
Can't keep my dick out my hand, ayy
Screaming free X and Teann, ayy
Dash of that soy on my sushi...
I said I'm not with the plan, ayy
I'm like "Bitch who is your man?" Ayy
Can't keep my dick out my hand, ayy
Screaming free X and Teann, ayy
Dash of that soy on my sushi, ayy
Uzi the same height as Uzi, ayy
Gave me the sloppiest Suzi, ayy, ayy
Yah
Two bad hoes on the road wanna give it up
To me...
Half nigga, half-ass killa never giving up
Plenty pie stocked up for the chicken bruh
I could give a fuck about your fans or your feeling, ugh
It's a sin to say that anything is similar
Uh
Or I'm on about it
'Cause no face, no case is the norm around it
*URL Dj Don Demarco Sound*
And I'm riding in a Bentley coup
Never see 'em, all you hear is shoot
Fuck a Trump and a fucking coon
This is not for the interviews or the evening news
Nah
I said I'm not with the plan, ayy
I'm like "Bitch who is your man?" Ayy
Can't keep my dick out my hand, ayy
Screaming free X and Teann, ayy
Dash of that soy on my sushi, ayy
Uzi the same height as Uzi, ayy (Chains and shit...)
Gave me the sloppiest Suzi, ayy, ayy
*Laughter*
Skeet skeet skeet skeet skeet
Please nigga...
JPEG motherfucking MAFIA...
Culture vultures get shot... (Throwing shots)
Bitch niggas that call the cops get got (I'm getting money)
Fuck outta here man, free the reals
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2...
(Why you mad at me?)
Damn man look those stacks. Yeah bitch, quarter million. TMZ!
Can't keep my dick in my pants
So fucked up I just spilled my drink on my manz
I'm throwin' up pourin' up more
I roll up a Stoge
And I don't give a fuck bout your stance
People only see the surface
Peace can be your purpose
Peep the potency of me it's perfect
Fuck with me it's worth it
And If you do
You can get residuals
All you individuals is pitiful
You'll never be original
Typical type
Stuck on your digital hype
Ain't shit without political ties
If you ask me
You got wack beats and despicable rhymes
Worthless
I'm the vaccine for your medicinal purpose
Fuck with me and it's worthless
I'm a lyrical circus
While your shit is as boring
As episcopal churches
Ain't no need to be nervous
I got the heat in the furnace, nigga
Real trap shit
