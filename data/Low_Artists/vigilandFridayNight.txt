Friday night
Put my backpack on to do my thing
But the bouncer wouldn't let me in
He just stood there with a stupid grin
Last time I went on cryin', but I kept tryin'
'Cause he don't know the moves that I'm supplyin'
I'll take my glasses, I'm gonna bounce back up
And kick some asses, I've waited long enough
You think you own me, you don't control me
You think you hurt me sayin' that I'm freaky
You're just a fake, I'm here to stay
Just 'cause I'm different, I shouldn't walk away
You think you own me, me, I control you, baby
You think you own me, me, I control you, baby (okay)
Own me, me, I control you, baby
You think you own me, me, I control you, baby
You're a freak
Don't belong 'cause you're alone and weak
But I'm just as cool as I am geek
Mr. Power, I am all on fleek
And this time I won't be cryin', no, I'm not buyin'
You know the slide as the moves that I'm supplyin'
I'll take my glasses, I'm gonna bounce back up
And kick some asses, I'm 'bout to call your bluff
You think you own me, you don't control me
You think you hurt me sayin' that I'm freaky
You're just a fake, I'm here to stay
Not gonna be that geek who walked away
You think you own me, you don't control me
You think you hurt me sayin' that I'm freaky
You're just a fake, I'm here to stay
Just 'cause I'm different, I shouldn't walk away
You think you own me, me, I control you, baby
You think you own me, me, I control you, baby (okay)
Own me, me, I control you, baby
You think you own me, me, I control you, baby
Own me, me, I control you, baby
You think you own me, me, I control you, baby
Own me, me, I control you, baby
You think you own me, me, I control you, baby
