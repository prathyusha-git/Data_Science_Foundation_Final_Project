I'm telling you girl
That I'm coming home to you
I hate to say this
But I know you've been untrue
Just stop your foolin'
Come on and hold me
When I come home to you
When I come home to you
It's plain to see love
Isn't something new to you
You couldn't be loved
Cause you've never known the truth
About the lies
You tell to me
When I come home to you
When I come home to you
Comin' home isn't good for me
I know
But the way that you look at me
I know
That I've got to come on home
And take you in my arms
Comin' home isn't good for me
I know
But the way that you look at me
I know
That I've got to come on home
And take you in my arms
I'm telling you girl
That I'm coming home to you
I hate to say this
But I know you've been untrue
Just stop your foolin'
Come on and hold me
When I come home to you
Yeah
When I come home to you
Whoa whoa
When I come home to you
