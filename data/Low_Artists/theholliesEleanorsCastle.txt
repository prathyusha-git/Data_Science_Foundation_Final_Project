Eleanor's castle boy what a hassle
Why did you have to build your walls so high
I'd put my arms around you
but a moat surrounds you
The only way's to let your drawbridge down
Nights without number
I'm without slumber
thinking of ways to breach your turrets tall
You're an iron lady
and someday maybe
you'll forget bar the iron door
Man was made to conquer
so the story goes
I wish I knew who said it
he could help me 'cause he knows
This situation getting way out of line
I can't win if you won't let me in
Ain't it a sin (It's a sin she won't let him in)
Shielded from my advances
there's very few chances
I'm a one-man crusade fighting in vain
Rack my brain for ideas
but it appears
compared to you dragons are easily slain
