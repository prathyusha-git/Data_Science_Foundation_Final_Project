You've confessed all you had to do
Youth possessed out of fear that they never had to lose
Are we changing I need you to say that
Tomorrow we're safe from our yesterday
Who are the Ghosts watching over us
Who do we follow when we're lost and we've had enough
Who are the Ghosts watching all of us
Who do we call to know we're not here alone in the dark
Know we're not here alone in the dark
Who are the Ghosts watching all of us
Who do we call to know we're not here alone in the dark
You've confessed all you had to do
Youth possessed out of fear that they never had to lose
Are we changing I need you to say that
Tomorrow we're safe from our yesterday
Who are the Ghosts watching over us
Who do we follow when we're lost and we've had enough
Who are the Ghosts watching all of us
Who do we call to know we're not here alone in the dark
Who are the Ghosts watching all of us
Who do we call to know we're not here alone in the dark
