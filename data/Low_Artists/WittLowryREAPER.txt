Yeah!
I just don't fit in with you other
Motherfuckers just stuck in the same home
Only been livin' here for a day and look how I've grown
Can make myself comfy, I'm better off all alone
And what's with all the wind? Since I've got here it's been blowin'
But fuck it, this'll do, and between me and you
I never planned on leavin' to tell you the damn truth
It's all a part of life, some things you just can't chose
You've never know I exist 'til you're sick and you can't move
It's either me or it's you, it's either you or it's me
I never could be the one you really want me to be
So different, but we're the same, I eat when you can't eat
I sleep when you can't sleep, I breathe when you can't breathe
Take a second, let it resonate
I'm in everything you do, each and every day
I'm in everything you do, you were never safe
Yeah, you used to be the one, now you're second place, haha
Already doubled in size
Just give me a couple years, you'll never find me in time
Just keep eatin' and smokin' and drinkin', you're so kind
This body used to be yours, I'm sorry but now it's mine, and I
I eat when you can't eat, yeah
I sleep when you can't sleep, yeah
I breathe when you can't breathe, yeah
Always runnin', but you never run from me
I eat when you can't eat
I sleep when you can't sleep, yeah
I breathe when you can't breathe
Always runnin', but you'll never run from me
I've been thriving in this environment
Provided by you to me, it's so beautiful
Explorin' every inch of your body, down to your cuticle
Waste your life away, every day you sit at a cubicle
I've been movin' into some other spots that are suitable
Haha, I hear you clickin' those keys
I hear you talkin' to your doc, got an appointment at three
He's gonna tell you you have cancer—what he means is me
They perceive to tell you things that might make me leave
Geez, slow down! Why are you drivin' so fast?
Oh shit, it's a quarter past, go quick, foot on the gas
Get your ass up in that office, do everything that they ask
They question if you been smokin', don't lie, we know that you have
Deep breath, but you can't breathe
He wants to see in your chest, what's that? Time to say "Cheese!"
He can't believe what he sees, you can't believe what you see
I feel you're startin' to sweat, I feel the shake in your knees
Damn, I'm sorry that it's too late
He tells you "Chemo might help," but you won't be saved
The next trip we take, it only goes one way
You wasted half your life just so you get paid
And all the money that you made, shit, you can't take
So you leave it in your bank for your grandkid's sake
Been feelin' all of your pain, I feel the way that you ache
You used to wish you would die, how long did it really take? And I
I eat when you can't eat, yeah
I sleep when you can't sleep, yeah
I breathe when you can't breathe, yeah
Always runnin', but you never run from me
I eat when you can't eat
I sleep when you can't sleep, yeah
I breathe when you can't breathe
Always runnin', but you'll never run from me
But you'll never run from me
Mmm, but you'll never run from me
A couple months and now we lie in this bed
The chemo didn't work and now I've moved to your head
I see all of your thoughts, you think about being dead
You think about all the things you often wished you had said
Like a couple more "I love you," a couple more "I trust you"
A couple more nights prayin' to the one above you
You are never gonna be a single person but you
You spent your whole life in the mirror sayin' "Fuck you!"
Where you gonna run to? I hear the room cryin'
I wish that I could say, "You'll be okay," but I'd be lyin'
Could buy anything, but could never buy time
And it's sad that you only realize when you're dyin', shit
I can feel your lungs weaken
Who knew your last weekend would become your last weekend?
Family's in the room, I wonder what they been thinkin'
I feel your heart, it's so heavy, I feel your temperature's sinkin'
It's time, no one can keep you alive
The human kind make environment's perfect for me to thrive
I guess we both destroy the one thing that keeps us alive
So buckle up, motherfucker, it's time that we take a ride, so
Die! I said Die!
So many things in your life you would change, you just ran out of time
