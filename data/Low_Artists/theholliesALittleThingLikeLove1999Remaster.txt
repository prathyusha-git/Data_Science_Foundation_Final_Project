Took you from Dakota
From the Black Hills to the plains
I brought you up a lady
And the right way to behave
Turned my pockets inside-out
And not a dime was saved
And now you're trying to decide
Whether to go or stay
Don't let a little thing like love
Keep on bringing you down, my babe
Or ever change the plans you made
Don't let a little thing like tears
Keep on turning you 'round, my babe
You're old enough to change your ways
And if you're feeling all run down,
You look for the brighter lights uptown
Don't let a little thing like me
Ever stand in your way
♪
Took you on a fast train
Across the Rio Grande
A Mexicano wedding
With a Tijuana band
You blew my whole life savings
And all the gold I'd panned
So if you're trying to find a way
To say your sweet goodbyes
Don't let a little thing like love
Keep on bringing you down, my babe
Or ever change the plans you made
Don't let a little thing like tears
Keep on turning you 'round, my babe
You're old enough to change your ways
And if you're feeling all run down,
You look for the brighter lights uptown
Don't let a little thing like me
Ever stand in your way

You're old enough to change your ways
And if you're feeling all run down
You look for the right to light the town
Don't let a little thing like me
Ever stand in your way

Don't let a little thing like love
