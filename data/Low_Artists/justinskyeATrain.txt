Riding on the A train,
Got you stuck on my brain
On my way to the city
Wanna know what you do when with me
Love on the wall like graffiti
I know running from you ain't easy
Gotta read between the lines
âE˜Cause I need the noise, I need the loud
I need the doors to shut you out!
I need the people, I need it bad
I need them all right now
I need the noise, I need the loud
I need the doors to shut you out!
I need to breathe, I need to think
Only way I'm gonna do it is on this A train!
Ooh oh oh oh
On the A train, yeah
Ooh oh oh oh
On the A train, yeah yeah yeah
A train, riding on the A train!
Lights on my daydream,
Underground, yeah it's the remedy
I could stay as long as I wanna
Somehow there's a right in this remedy
I love you but I need some time
and the tracks just help me to clear my mind
Don't take it personal,
I just need a moment!
âE˜Cause I need the noise, I need the loud
I need the doors to shut you out!
I need the people, I need it bad
I need them all right now
I need the noise, I need the loud
I need the doors to shut you out!
I need to breathe, I need to think
Only way I'm gonna do it is on this A train!
Ooh oh oh oh
On the A train, yeah
Ooh oh oh oh
On the A train, yeah yeah yeah
A train, riding on the A train!
Catch me on the A train, A train
Catch me on the A train, A train
Catch me on the A train, A train
