Blowing kisses into the abyss
And it is someone else's problem now
And then, phone it in
To feign lip servicing
I'm not going to help you
I'm not going to save you
But you won't let me be
You won't let me be
And now you couldn't give it away
Or pay someone else to take it
Beautiful, useless
Full of excuses
