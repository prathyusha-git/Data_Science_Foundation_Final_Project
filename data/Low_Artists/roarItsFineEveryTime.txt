I don't blame you
There's nothing to do
I can't cry when I need to
Every time
Every time
Every time I think I've found it I am wrong
It's a habit
Just being traumatic
No reason to panic
Every time
Every time
Every time I think I've found it I am wrong
Lonely and paralyzed by fear
Like every single time you hoped you'd disappear
Lonely and paralyzed by fear
Like every single time you hoped you'd disappear
Lonely and paralyzed by fеar
Like every singlе time you hoped you'd disappear
I don't need anyone
I don't need anything I'll be fine on my own
At least I'd like to think so
I don't need anyone
I don't need anything I'll be fine on my own
At least I'd like to think so
