I ain't got time for you, baby
Either you're mine or you're not
Make up your mind, sweet baby

A little party never killed nobody
So we gon' dance until we drop, mmm
A little party never killed nobody
Right here, right now's all we got

Just one night, all we got
Just one night, all we got
Just one night, all we got, got, got
Speakeasy, rocking the feathers, I'm breezy
What do you think, GoonRock?
Are you ready?
Don't mean a thing if I give you my heart
If you tear it apart, no, ah, ah, ah, ow
It don't mean a thing if I ain't in your eyes
Papa, that ain't gonna fly, no, ah, ah, ah, ow

Glad that you made it, look around
You don't see one person sittin' down
They got drinks in their hand and their room's above
At the end of the night, maybe you'll find love
Fake chit-chat of the things they got
And my stout reputation of keeping it hot
This the party of the year and my master plan
Is to make you realize I'm your man
