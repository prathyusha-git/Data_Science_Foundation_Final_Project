Since you took my heart
I can give you everything
So I'll give my everything
To you, my love
As we're far apart
I will send my all to you
And I'll send my whole life too
To you, my love
Long to be near you
And hold you, and kiss you, my sweet
When I am with you, I know that my life is complete
Now I'm coming home
Coming back to give my love
To the one I'm dreaming of
To you, my love
Long to be near you
And hold you, and kiss you, my sweet
When I am with you, I know that my life is complete
Now I'm coming home
Coming back to give my love
To the one I'm dreaming of
To you, my love
To you, my love
To you, my love
