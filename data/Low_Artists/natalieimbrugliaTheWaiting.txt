Oh baby, don't it feel like heaven right now?
Don't it feel like something from a dream?
Yeah, I've never known nothing quite like this
Don't it feel like tonight might never be again?
We know better than to try and pretend
No one could have ever told me 'bout this
I said yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The waiting is the hardest part
Every day you see one more card
You take it on faith, you take it to the heart
The waiting is the hardest part
Well, yeah, I might have chased a couple men around
All it ever got me was down
Then there were those that made me feel good
But never as good as I'm feeling right now
Baby, you're the only one that's ever known how
To make me wanna live like I wanna live now
I said yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The waiting is the hardest part
Every day you get one more yard
You take it on faith, you take it to the heart
The waiting is the hardest part
Don't let it kill you, baby
Don't let it get to you
Don't let it kill you, baby
Don't let it get to you
I'll be your bleeding heart
I'll be your crying fool
Don't let this go too far
Don't let it get to you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The waiting is the hardest part
Every day you get one more yard
You take it on faith, you take it to the heart
The waiting is the hardest part
The waiting is the hardest part
