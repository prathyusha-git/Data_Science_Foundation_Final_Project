I've gotta beam my message to ya
Straight from the sattelite
'cos girl we're meant to be together
Yeah girl we're meant to be together
I'm back out on the Riviera
It gets so cold at night
I've gotta beam my message to ya
I've gotta beam my message to ya
I've gotta beam my message to ya
Should've known from the call that you let up
You're not alone when you're still in love
And everyone says that I'm the upsetter
But I'm alone and I'm so in love
I've got it bad and now this heart beats black
So black, oh yeah
We live in 1992 here
Playing sleeping sattelites
Playing Prince and Deacon Blue, yeah
Playing "I Will Always Love You", yeah
But when I think of me and you
Get shivers down my spine
I've gotta beam my message to ya
I've gotta beam my message to ya
Should've known from the call that you let up
You're not alone when you're still in love
And everyone says that I'm the upsetter
But I'm alone and I'm so in love
I've got it bad and now this heart beats black
So black, oh yeah
Should've known from the call that you let up
You're not alone when you're still in love
And everyone says that I'm the upsetter
But I'm alone and I'm so in love
I've got it bad and now this heart beats black
So black, oh yeah
You're really giving me a hard time tonight
You're really giving me a hard time tonight
Why you giving me a hard time tonight?
You're really giving me a hard time tonight
You're really giving me a hard time tonight
You're really giving me a hard time tonight
Why you giving me a hard time tonight?
You're really giving me a hard time tonight
