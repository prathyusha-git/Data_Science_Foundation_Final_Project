Leave me
If it gives you satisfaction
Slander my name all over the place
Don't you have an inclination?
You're gonna ruin a reputation
Leave me
Tell me
Now I've got you in the corner
Won't you admit you've been telling me lies?
I don't care about you
I'll get along without you
Leave me
It's so hard to please you, yeah (Hard to please you, yeah)
Tease you, oh (Hard to tease you, oh)
Leave me
I don't ever want you near me
Pack all your things and get out of my sight
Your love was made of sand
I've had all I can stand
Leave me
It's so hard to please you, yeah (Hard to please you, yeah)
Tease you, oh (Hard to tease you, oh)
Leave me
I don't ever want you near me
Pack all your things and get out of my sight
Your love was made of sand
I've had all I can stand
Leave me
You've got to leave me baby
C'mon now
You've got to leave me baby
Oh, oh, oh, oh
