Do you know where I've been
Did you wonder where I went
I've been asleep for the last year
Skipping on life
Saved a ton on the rent
Checking in to the nightmare
A key card for my descent
I stayed down on the bottom floor
Stuck in four walls that I wouldn't recommend
No
And I've never felt that down
I've been to the edge and back around now
And I never thought I'd make it out
But now I'm awake
Everything feels like summer
Everything feels like summer
Now I'm awake
Everything feels like summer

Did you know I was gone
Can you remember when
I've been asleep for the last year
I was so tired
Maybe it was heaven sent
Was there a dream inside the nightmare
Maybe I'd do it all again
'Cause if I hadn't seen the nightmare
Looping down there
It could still be cold up here
Now I'm awake
Everything feels like summer
Everything feels like summer
Now I'm awake
Everything feels like summer

Now I'm awake
Everything feels like summer
Everything feels like summer

Everything feels like summer

And I've never felt that down
I've been to the edge and back around now
And I never thought I'd make it out
