Tell me that you'll be okay
I'm sorry I'm so far away to tell you that I love you
We do our best to never be afraid
But I'm just hopin' for a chance to save her tonight
I hear those silent screams from far away
And hope for better days
Dear God, give me a sign
It's quiet lately, I've been thinking that you hate me
And I'm not exactly sure that you're home
You know I miss her so much
Tell me that you'll be okay
I'm sorry I'm so far away to tell you that I love you
I swear to God that I will change
I pray to get just one more day to tell you that I love you
To tell you that I love you, 'cause I do
And here I question every single thing
Now I'm just hoping there's a chance you'll save me tonight
You feel so far away
The more it hurts, the more you fade
I'm losin' hope, why won't you give me a sign?
You know I miss her so much
Tell me that you'll be okay
I'm sorry I'm so far away to tell you that I love you
I swear to God that I will change
I pray to get just one more day to tell you that I love you
To tell you that I love you, 'cause I do
I love you more than you know
It's quiet lately, I've been thinking that you hate me
And I'm not exactly sure that you're home
But the thought of the two of us, we're bleeding out and so in love
If passing is inevitable
You know I miss her so much
Tell me that you'll be okay
I'm sorry I'm so far away to tell you that I love you
I swear to God that I will change
I pray to get just one more day to tell you that I love you
To tell you that I love you, 'cause I do
I love you more than you know
I love you more than you know
