Babe, I've tried walking away
But no one compares to you
Pictures of you in my brain
I can't forget us two
I would give all of my time
All my my love
And promise I'd stay for the night
Oh, my love
Never knew that I lost
You until it was over
I wish I could rewind
Now I'll be here waiting for life
For life, for life
Now I won't let go, let go
'Cause I'll be here waiting for life
For life, for life
No, I won't let go, let go
'Cause I'll be here waiting for life

Now I'll be here waiting for life
For life for life
Now I won't let go let go
'Cause I'll be here waiting for life
For life, for life
No, I won't let go, let go
'Cause I'll be here waiting
Saying name like it's yours
One touch of you, I'm alive
I hope someday you will know
For you I'd run thousand miles
I would give all of my time
All my my love
And promise I'd stay for the night
Oh, my love
Never knew that I lost
You until it was over
I wish I could rewind
Now I'll be here waiting for life
For life, for life
Now I won't let go, let go

No, I won't let go, let go
