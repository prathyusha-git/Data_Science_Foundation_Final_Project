Take your time, I can wait
All of our love I know will be mine
If you take your time
Take your time, though it's late
Heart strings will sing like a string of twine
If you take your time
Take your time and take mine too
I have time to spend
Take your time, go with me through
Times 'til all times end
verse 1
verse 3
verse 1
For our love, the love I know will be mine
If you take your time
