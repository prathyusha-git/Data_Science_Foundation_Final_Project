You remain indifferent when we brush hands
♪
I'm annihilated right where I stand
♪
Touching the air between you and me, I sleep
To wake up feeling empty
Oh no, nobody hurts me
I fulfill my own prophecy
Oh no, nobody hurts me
I fulfill my own prophecy
I do my best
Just to try and accept
That we move in opposite directions
I do my best
Just to try and accept
That we move in opposite directions
I do my best
Just to try and accept
That we move in opposite directions
