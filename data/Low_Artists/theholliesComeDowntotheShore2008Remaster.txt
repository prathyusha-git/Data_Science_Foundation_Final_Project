Doesn't seem like a year ago
I left the city lights
To find me an island
To find the key to my life
Couldn't say that it's all been good
'Cause I miss my enemy
Sweet little woman
You know she came right away
Came on that steamer
That's sailing into the bay
So come down to the shore
The boat is in from the mainland
Come down to the shore
And put your feet in the warm sand
Oh, there'll be a party tonight
Bursting the salt sea bubble alright
If you wanna know what life is for
Come down to the shore
Won't need no moon above
'Cause my woman's got starry eyes
Knows how to love me
Make a wish paradise
Oh, how she loves me
When I hold her tonight
So come down to the shore
The boat is in from the mainland
Come down to the shore
And put your feet in the warm sand
Oh, there'll be a party tonight
Bursting the salt sea bubble alright
If you wanna know what life is for
Come down to the shore
Nobody's given me love
Just like a warm summer breeze
When I see it coming to me laughing
I know it's all I really need
There'll be a party tonight
Bursting the salt sea bubble alright
If you wanna know what life is for
Come down to the shore
Nobody's given me love
Just like a warm summer breeze
When I see it coming to me laughing
I know it's all I really need
There'll be a party tonight
Bursting the salt sea bubble alright
If you wanna know what life is for
Come down to the shore
The boat is in from the mainland
You come down to the shore
Put your feet in the warm sand
You come down to the shore, shore, shore
Oh, put your feet in the warm sand
You come down to the shore
