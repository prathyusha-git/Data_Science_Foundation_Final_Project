A winter's day
In a deep and dark December
I am alone
I'm gazing from my window to the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow
I am a rock, I am an island
I built walls
A fortress deep and mighty
That none may penetrate
I have no need of friendship, friendship causes pain
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain
I am a rock, I am an island
Don't talk of love
Well, I've heard the word before
It's deep in my memory
I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died
If I never loved I never would have cried
I am a rock, I am an island
I have my books
And my poetry to protect me
I'm shielded in my armour
Hiding in my room, safe within my room
I touch no-one and no-one touches me
I am a rock, I am an island
And a rock feels no pain
And an island never cries
I am a rock, I am an island
I am a rock, I am an island
