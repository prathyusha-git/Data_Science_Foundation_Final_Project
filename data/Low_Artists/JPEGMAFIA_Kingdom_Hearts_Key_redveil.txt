(You think you know me)
寒い夜も
寒い夜も
Just one time, bitch, think
All they money get flushed in a blink (in a blink)
Shut up and dribble, go get me a ring
You got money, you don't got to think
I was champ one time, Bisping
Left the apps, now I get where you beens
Feel like Ezra when I'm on the scene
All these felonies, they'll never see
Got my cup, like I'm Argentinian
Like forsaken bitch, stay off screen
I'm addicted to hatin' on me
Don't know what it takes, do not intervene (ah!)
Just one time, bitch, think (think)
All they money get flushed in a blink (in a blink)
Shut up and dribble, go get me a ring
You got money, you don't got to think
All these crackers be soft as mink
Hunter Biden, stay out my sink
Ketamine got me singin' like Tink
Hit just like a pill, I feel like I'm P!nk, bitch
Just one time, bitch, think (think)
All they money get flushed in a blink (in a blink)
Shut up and dribble, go get me a ring
You got money, you don't got to think
Ah, ah, ah, ah, uh
One, one, uh
Look where my hairline has came
Left and the right is the same
You bitches should form up like Danity Kane
People scared to put in work
You won't take a L, so you'll take a name
I'm playin' above the rim (yeah), I brought a gun to the game (uh)
I'm livin' life with no rules
You try to play foul, I'm shootin' the trey
This year I triple my cost
A feature with -, a pic with Ghislaine
I'm livin' life in a flash
We Kyrie your car, you Ezra my name (what?)
Industry thinks that I need them, all that I need is a note lane
KO
Make what you do look easy
Can't see me, they all get queasy
Movin' on up like George and Weezy
Take ya style back 'cause I really don't need it
Kapital on me, but that is the lower case
No, we not linkin' up, we do not correlate
They cannot breathe, I make 'em all suffocate
Fuck all that shit, don't care about what you say
Ay, ay, ay, ay (ay, ay)
Big bag on me, like I just got out the county
Ay, ay, ay, ay (ay, ay)
They play Iron Man like Robert Downey
Better watch her, she all on me
Got love in the middle, I ain't Monie
No Nobu, bitch, you get Coney
Ain't no way a bitch get shit from me (style)
Who you think you is?
You better go and get it together (uh-huh)
Better get a new idea 'cause fuckin' with me
Consequences forever (go)
(寒い夜も)
This is a young nigga world
This is a young nigga world (寒い夜も)
We got next ho, clear the front
Been throwin' my elbow in this shit
They on me like Velcro, all I need is a cellphone
I'ma get what I want
You been on Melrose full of lawyers, spare home
At the end of the month
Try get the bread home, man, I'm tryna get the bread home
With my brothers, they stunt (dah, dah)
Kill the façade, why it smell like (beef)
Pull out the Glock, get up out the (mix)
Fuck out my ear, you don't know (shit)
You ain't in no trench, that's what you (is)
This shit my lifeline
Ain't gon' wait for no right time, just to get up and sprint
He in his right mind, he gon' (sit)
Party's over, grandpa
