Stuck in traffic in my head
Standing still but I can't climb the freeway
But he woke me up and said you haven't done enough
And I said okay, okay, okay
What is enough? Tell me how does it feel
Hunger returns after every meal
I finish first, then I'm back where I started, enough
It's a moving target
It's a moving target
My appetite's from childhood
Cause every school year comes with graduation
Maybe that's why trying hurts
If it's not served with constant affirmation
♪
What is enough? Tell me how does it feel?
Is it when you win or is it when you heal?
Clearly it don't come from trying my hardest, enough
It's a moving target
It's a moving target
What's the first thing that you've done
When you're on top of a hill
You're at the bottom of another
Why can't I be satisfied, be grateful and still
Keep that hunger, that keeps me climbing
What is enough, tell me how does it feel
Starting to wonder if enough is real
Father forgive all your gifts disregarded
There's too much light here to be heavy hearted
I decide what is enough and then guard it, enough
It's a moving target
It's a moving target
It's a moving target
It's a moving target, yeah
It's a moving target, target
It's a moving target, yeah
It's moving
