I never thought I'd make it
But I've been standing my ground
And I'm doing just fine without you
Yeah no I don't even trip about it
And ever since you went left
I found what's right for me, loving myself
enough for two
No I don't even trip about it
Thank you for the light you showed me
cause I know now
What I wish I would've know
I'm just loving life, yeah I'm just doing me
I'm strong enough when I'm alone
So you ain't gotta worry 'bout me baby
(don't worry bout me baby)
I'm good, I'm good
So you ain't gotta worry 'bout me baby
(don't worry bout me baby)
I'm good, yes I'm good
I did it all before you, you know it, so I
can do it again
See you ain't gotta worry 'bout me baby
(don't worry bout me baby)
If I'm the one that held me down then I
can hold it down for myself
Hold it down, hold it down yeah
Hold it down, hold it down yeah
Hold it down myself
I won't forget about it
Cause you meant everything to me, but
now I'm looking out for something new
But all I really wanted was to be with you
baby
Oh now I'm saying
Thank you for the light you showed me
cause I know now
What I wish I would've know
I'm just loving life, yeah I'm just doing me

So you ain't gotta worry 'bout me baby
(don't worry bout me baby)
I'm good, I'm good
So you ain't gotta worry 'bout me baby
(don't worry bout me baby)
I'm good, yes I'm good
I did it all before you, you know it, so I
can do it again
See you ain't gotta worry 'bout me baby
(don't worry bout me baby)
If I'm the one that held me down then I
can hold it down for myself
Whoa but most importantly, I wanted to
believe that you were mine
Because I loved you baby
But now I finally see, I need a real love to
keep me alive
Now I'm on to the next thing
Thank you for the light you showed me
