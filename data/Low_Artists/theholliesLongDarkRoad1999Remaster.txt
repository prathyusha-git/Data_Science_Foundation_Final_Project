It's over, well over
In my mind and in my heart
It's over, well over
But then again, it didn't have a good start
You'd tell me, try to sell me
It could have been all I asked
It's over, well over
It's there and flows away a distant past
Now it's a long, dark road
Yes, a long, dark road
And you know I loved you
Yes, you know I loved you
Now it's a long, dark road
Yes, a long, dark road
And you know I loved you
Yes, you know I loved you
It's over, well over
And we can't revive what's past
It's gone now, moved on now
But then again it didn't have a chance to last
No, no, no, a chance to last
Now it's a long, dark road (It's a long, very long, road)
Yes, a long, dark road (It's a long, very long, road)
And you know I loved you
Yes, you know I loved you
Now it's a long, dark road (It's a long, very long, road)
Yes, a long, dark road (It's a long, very long, road)
Now it's a long, dark road (It's a long, very long, road)
Yes, a long, dark road (It's a long, very long, road)
Now it's a long, dark road (It's a long, very long, road) (Baby, I need you, I need you)
Yes, a long, dark road (It's a long, very long, road)
Now it's a long, dark road (It's a long, very long, road)
Yes, a long, dark road (It's a long, very long, road)
