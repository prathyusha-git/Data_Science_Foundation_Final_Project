Maybe I'm just scared of a winter
With no warmth again
The seasons change, it changes more
Than just the scene in front of me
It's worth my while
But it seems miles away from where I can see from here
I wish that I could tell you why
But I don't think that's me
Out in Sunnyland we got caught
So bad in the storm again
We lost our time and watched
It all fall down 'til there was barely anything
And I keep on looking for it
It's probably best I just ignore it
What happened to all that time in front of me
So I will try to hold you as you fall apart
'Cause even angels die, too, they die in the dark
Know that I'll always love you even when it's too late to
And you'll always live inside of me
♪
For a moment I thought I could use these hands again
I look down and feel pathetic
Withered as they've come to be
Even my clothes look sad
I'll take them back and give them all away
I'll give, you take, we breathe
I promise I'll try to hold you as you fall apart
'Cause even angels die, too, they die in the dark
Know that I'll always love you even when it's hard to
And you'll always live inside of me
♪
I will try
♪
I will try, oh
♪
So I will try to hold you as you fall apart
'Cause even angels die, too, they die in the dark
Know that I'll always love you even when it's too late to
And you'll always live inside of me
