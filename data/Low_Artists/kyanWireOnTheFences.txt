Cuffed to stop the clock
Hey, bars on the windows
Waters flunking by
Pills in the water,
Water fills the ice, yeah
WIRE ON THE FENCES
With these waters flunking, waters flunking
Waters flunking by
She's the girl in the poster
But when you look a little closer
You see the rollercoasters
Burn those blue eyes greener, oh
Even superstars get older
The girl who lost her mind
These are dark, dark
These are dark, dark times
These are dark, dark times
These are dark, dark times
These are dark, dark times, yeah
Devil's in the lunch room
Then it's demons in the line
Yeah, ghosts in my hallway
Waters flunking by
She's the girl in the poster
But when you look a little closer
You see the rollercoasters
Burn those blue eyes greener, oh
Even superstars get older
The girl who lost her mind
These are dark, dark
These are dark, dark times
Oh yeah!
