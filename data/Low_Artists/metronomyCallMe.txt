Call it as you see
Call it what you like
Call it you and me
Call it anything only wrong to do
Saw it from afar
Coming into view
Call it anything
Call it your friend
But everyone's your friend
Only if they say
Call up on me
We all need company

Follow Rivoli
Follow Vivienne
Follow them to me
Follow anything
Only wrong to do
Saw them from afar
Crashing in to view
Follow anything
Follow your friends
But everyone's your friend
Only if they say
Call up on me
But you belong to me

Oh, we can do anything
We can do anything
You could be mine
We can try anything
We can say we'll try anything
And you could be mine
