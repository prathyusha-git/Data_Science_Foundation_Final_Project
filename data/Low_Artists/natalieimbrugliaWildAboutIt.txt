Like a song
Like the new boots that I have on
A blue sky like a stranger that's walking by
Catching your eye
Could you set me free
Make a move on me 'cause someone's getting to you
Hmm
Is it someone getting to you
I'm wild about it
Ah ah ah
I'm wild about it
(She's wild about it)
I'm wild about it
Ah ah ah
I'm wild about it
(She's wild about it)
Oh
Ah
Oh
Ah ah ah
Oh
Ah
Oh
Ah ah ah
Like a bomb
Like fireworks to carry on
I wanna play
I wanna let the circus take me away
So what do you say
Could you set me free
Make a move on me 'cause someone's getting to you
Is it someone getting to ya
I'm wild about it
Ah ah ah
I'm wild about it
(She's wild about it)
I'm wild about it
Ah ah ah
I'm wild about it
(She's wild about it)
Oh
Ah
Oh
Ah ah ah
