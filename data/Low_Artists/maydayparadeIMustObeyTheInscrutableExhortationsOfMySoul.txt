I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead
I wonder what you're doing now
I wonder what it's like to be the leaves
Maybe it's like the bottom of the sea
Hope it's good, but I can't tell you because I'm dead, alright

Cheer up now, everybody
There's a reason to roll that stone
Give 'em something to chew on
Give 'em hell and some rock and roll
To the best of the good times
Lift 'em up, sing together
"We're just keeping it warm" (ah)
Heaven waits in the riptide
And it's coming to take us home
Ain't it sad how it seems like
Everything is more beautiful
When it gets to the ending?
When it crashes together
Anything can happen to anyone
