Do you believe in love?
Do you believe in love?
There ain't no doubt about it
Everybody's gonna jump up and shout about
Do you believe in love?
Do you believe in love?
Do you believe in love?
There ain't no doubt about it
Everybody's gonna jump up and shout about
Do you believe in love?
Taking a walk down in the street
There's bound to be someone you can meet
Someone who believes in love
Someone who only needs a shove
Going together hand in hand
Don't need a reason for what's planned
Don't mess around, you gotta do it right
Do it right, you can stay all night
Do you believe in love?
Do you believe in love?
There ain't no doubt about it
Everybody's gonna jump up and shout about
Do you believe in love?
Do you believe in love?
Do you believe in love?
Do you believe in love?
