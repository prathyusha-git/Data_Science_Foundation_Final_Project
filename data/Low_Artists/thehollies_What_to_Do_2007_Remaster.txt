What to do now that she doesn't want me?
That's what haunts me
What to do? What to do to keep from feeling lonely?
Want her only, what to do?
The record hops and all the happy times we had
The soda shop, the walks to school now make me sad
Oh, what to do? I know my heart is showing
Still not knowing what to do?
The record hops and all the happy times we had
The soda shop, the walks to school now make me sad
Oh, what to do? I know my heart is showing
Still not knowing what to do?
What to do? What to do?
To do, what to do? what to do
To do, what to do? what to do
To do, what to do? what to do
To do, what to do? what to do
To do, what to do? what to do
To do, what to do? what to do
To do, what to do? what to do
To do, what to do? what to do
