Jessie says she's been here for a thousand days
A thousand days to her, that just don't mean a thing
'Cause the city makes a perfect place to sleep
And daddy's comin' home, he said he brought her things
Like jewels from every coast and songs for them to sing
But singing never got her very far
And this whole coast is full of pin-up paper rockstars
She says she'll run
Until her feet don't touch the ground
And as the waves carry me out
Keep listening, she'll never make a sound
So keep it coming and the details quiet
She's like the girl that keeps you up all night, and
She'll be a secret you can keep, keep me
Cuts on paper hearts, they can be awful deep
Rips from wear and tear on different city streets
Don't all need a home, but just a place to sleep
So I will run
Until my feet don't touch the ground
And as the waves carry me out
Keep listening, she'll never make a sound
So keep it coming and the details quiet
She's like the girl that keeps you up all night, and
She'll be a secret you can keep, keep me, keep me
Until she finds
That every time she runs, she leaves behind
Another piece of her on every city street
So I will run
Until my feet don't touch the ground
As the waves carry me out
Keep listening
So I will run
Until my feet don't touch the ground
And as the waves carry me out
Keep listening, she'll never make a sound
So keep it coming and the details quiet
She's like the girl that keeps you up all night, and
She'll be a secret you can keep, keep me, keep me
So keep it coming and the details quiet
She's like the girl that keeps you up all night, and
She'll be a secret you can keep, keep me, keep me
