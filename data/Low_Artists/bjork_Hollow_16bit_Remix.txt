Hollow, my ancestors have access
Hollow, I'm falling down the abyss
Hollow, looking for some answers
Generations of mothers sailing in
Somehow, they all were ship folks
Hollow, the ground is opening up
Swallows me up, the trunk of DNA
The trunk of DNA, trunk
Now come forth, all human species
Fall out one piece
No one race
From her pieces
No more pieces
I'm part of it, hollow
Like a bead in necklace
Thread me upon this chain
I'm part of it
The everlasting necklace
The everlasting necklace
Jewels after jewels, after jewels, after
Jewels after jewels, after jewels
I yearn to belong, let me belong (let me belong)
