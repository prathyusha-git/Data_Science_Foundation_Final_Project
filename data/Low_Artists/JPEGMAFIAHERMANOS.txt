I named this one JPEG, because I like JPEG's, uh
For the resolution, the color, the size of them
Everything about JPEGs I like
Check
Narcissists, arsonists in my arsenal
Got carpal tunnel 'cause I was holdin' that awkward
Got the queer block, hot works, I work my mat
Livin' like the early '80s and I got a sex habit
Habitual bridge burners sicker than Bob's Burgers
Nice with the shit since ridin' a bike on sherm
Was broken and washed, didn't have change for Arnold Palmers
AC broke, yayo truck was armored
Now everything I drive, it ain't got no gas
Late night nigga, inner city since Arctic blast
Bitch body out of this world, she got a Martian ass
You always with them niggas, be the sausage fest
We all gonna land back to steal on a DOT's
I see why you a bad rapper
Get the fuck up out my face before I smack the ass backwards
When you're average at life, they can't get much better, rapper
"Let the truth prevail," like the King of Pop said
Ain't fuck with no Percs since they found Prince dead
Nigga, no cap
The bitch got bald heads and you think it's all wraps
'Til them niggas all dead, old head
I'm out for that hog head cheese (still)
I'm a legend from Michigan like Mateen Cleaves
Rest in peace Eric Garner, 'cause I can't breathe
Smokin' loosey's on the same corner, used to serve fiends
Servin' up a Mojito
Okay, look
The black Konami cheat code
More Mitch than the Rico
The toast mint condition like serving up a Mojito
Overworked so all of my talent backs up my ego
Up the score, off the rebound, and-one with the free throw
Oh, she want the nerve with her, go figure
Posed too hard for the image, she cropped yo' ass out the picture
Gave me the leg up and that ain't even a kicker
Dropped SCARING THE HOES, end' up terrifying the nigge r, wait
I got this down to a T, sharp as a crewcut, uh
Tables turn like Serato with death queued up
Y'all made a race, so I did the mechanic suit up
And I drive sum' crazy whenever the autotune's up
Put Tony on the mic like Pacino
Good fella with the lines, bangin' like De Niro, wait
Let's get this clear yo, the flows is a-blazin'
Don't slip, don't slack, now Rothstein in Casino
Ayy, let me get that one back
Uh
Men lie, women lie, but the numbers don't
With no machines, so my numbers go where your numbers won't
Nasty
