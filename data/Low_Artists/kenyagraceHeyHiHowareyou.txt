Hey. Hi. How are you?
I've been trying to call you
Life's hard without you
And I can't seem to get through
Hey. Hi. How are you?
I've been trying to call you
Life's hard without you
And I can't seem to get through
I took the motorway
To drive past your place
Then I heard you moved away
But you said you'd stay
People tell me all the time to try be someone new
But I don't wanna talk to anybody else but you
Hey. Hi. How are you?
I've been trying to call you
Life's hard without you
And I can't seem to get through
Hey. Hi. How are you?
I've been trying to call you
Life's hard without you
And I can't seem to get through
I think of the last day
When we chilled at mine
I wish there was a way
Of knowing it's the last time
People tell me all the time to try be someone new
But I don't wanna talk to anybody else but you
Hey. Hi. How are you?
I've been trying to call you
Life's hard without you
And I can't seem to get through
Hey. Hi. How are you?
I've been trying to call you
Life's hard without you
And I can't seem to get through
Mm
And I can't seem to get through
Ooh, ooh
And I can't seem to get through
Really makes me hate myself
That I can't get you out my head
I wish that I was strong, but you're gone
Really makes me hate myself
That I can't get you out my head
I wish that I was strong, but you're gone
