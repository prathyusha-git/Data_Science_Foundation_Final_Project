Well I'm a love struck baby I must confess
Life without darlin' is a solid mess
Thinkin' bout you baby gives me such a thrill
I gotta have you baby, can't get my fill
I love you baby and I know just what to do
I still remember and let it be said
The way you make me feel take a fool to forget
I swore a ton of bricks had hit me in the head
And what you do little baby ain't over it yet
Every time I see you make me feel so fine
Heart beatin' crazy, my blood run wild
Lovin' makes me feel like a might mighty man
Love me baby aint i your man
I'm a love struck baby
Yeah I'm a love struck baby
You got me love struck baby
And I know just what to do
Sparks start flyin' every time we meet
Let me tell you baby you knock me off my feet
Your kisses trip me up they're so dog gone sweet
Ya know baby you can't be beat
I'm a love struck baby
Yeah I'm a love struck baby
You got me love struck baby
And I know just what to do
