For the first time
For the first time
Listen, my heart is breakin', maybe I lack the patience
But how have all your vices now become my obligation?
With every slip you take, you change, and damn, I fuckin' hate it
I might take every bottle in this motherfuckin' house and break it
I can't take it, as you've become a slave to somethin' faceless
You always say you'll change, yeah, you always say the same shit
How could someone so wise become so equally complacent?
You're about to lose it all, do you not care enough to save it, motherfucker?
I'm sorry, damn, it's been a long day
But think about it, have you ever asked if I was okay?
You see, your problems create problems, then you drink 'em away
It's not until you sober up enough that that's when you say (hey)
I fucked up again and slept in all of my clothes
For the first time in a while (for the first time, for the first time)
I fucked up again, and blocked out, I lost all control
For the first time in a while (for the first time, for the first time)
Yeah, you wasted years gettin' wasted, I don't need your sorry, just save it
You think I can't tell you're faded? I don't mean to be so abrasive
I know you have a disease, and that you're just scared to face it
I don't mean to make this 'bout me, but can't you see why I'm jaded?
I miss the you you are when you're sober, you've added years to your face
And not just because you're gettin' older, but 'cause you drank and you drank
It feels like the world's on your shoulders, you carry all of its weight
And the doctor said you're bipolar, you think there's been a mistake
And I know, I'm not your brain, it's not my place to tell you what is real
All that I can do is try to tell you how I fuckin' feel
Stuck by you through it all, I don't ever question if I love you still
The greatest gift that you could ever give me is to fuckin' heal
I never would've thought you'd let the liquor run your life
You drink when everything is wrong, you drink when everything is right
Not here to downplay all your pain or all the demons that you fight
But over family and friends, how could you pick a vodka sprite?
Another night and another lie, you try to hide it, I can tell
You're drunk again, 'cause on your breath, the alcohol is all I smell
We only have this life to live, why would you choose to live in hell?
If you won't get sober for me, at least just do it for yourself
Damn, I feel you fadin' away
I never let you hit rock bottom, maybe that's what it takes
For you to finally put the bottle down before it's too late
It's not until you sober up enough that that's when you say (hey)
I fucked up again and slept in all of my clothes
For the first time in a while (for the first time, for the first time)
I fucked up again, and blocked out, I lost all control
For the first time in a while (for the first time, for the first time)
