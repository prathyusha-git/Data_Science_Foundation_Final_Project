I don't wanna, oh, woah, woah-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-ooh-oh
When we hooked up, we sat down
Made an agreement, we vowed that
That we'd always be together through whatever
You said that, "No one would ever get between us
This love would never ever leave us"
That was a while ago
But now lately feels like
I mean, I feel like all we do is fight every single night
Can't keep it tight, can't get it right
I just wanna go back, take it way back
All the way back, can we start again?
Do it over, can we straighten it out?
Can we work it out?
'Cause I don't wanna
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna (don't wanna)
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone
I can't sleep without you, think without you
Eat without you, speak without you, be without you
I can't even breathe without you
I can't feel without you, deal without you, spend without you
My whole world is upside down
Don't wanna go out 'cause I can't ride without you
Like I'm gon' die without you
What is a girl supposed to do?
Wanna I spend my last dime being in your life
I don't wanna be without you
I don't wanna
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna (don't wanna)
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna (don't wanna)
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone
How can this be?
That it's not workin' out
We vowed to be always together
It's hurting me
Wasn't supposed to be this way
Where do we go wrong?
We both made mistakes, we gotta carry on
Turn up now
I don't wanna
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna (don't wanna)
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna (be)
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna (live)
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone
