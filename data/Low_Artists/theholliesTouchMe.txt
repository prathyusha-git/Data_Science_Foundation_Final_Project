I was alone weighing all my fantasies
Until you came and liberated me
And taught my soul much about humanity yea yea yea
I needed you to know
I'm more than just a one night stand
And girl with your permission
Maybe you can give me your hand
I'm at your command
It's just the way you touch me baby
Oh it's the way you touch me baby
We can walk we can talk all night long
It's the way you touch me baby
I was alone grasping for my sanity
Your beauty came free of vanity
Wo blew my mind gave me your anatomy yea yea yea
And if you didn't know
I'm more than just a one night stand
I need some supervision
I'm losing all control of my hands
They're at your command
It's just the way you touch me baby
Oh it's the way you touch me baby
We can walk we can talk all night long
It's the way you touch me baby
And if you didn't know
You got me feeding from your hand
My chef is gonna blow
And baby it ain't going to end until your command
It's just the way you touch me baby
Oh it's the way you touch me baby
We can walk we can talk all night long
It's the way you touch me baby
