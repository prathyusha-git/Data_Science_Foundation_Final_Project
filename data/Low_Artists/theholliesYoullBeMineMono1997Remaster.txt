It's been too long since I kissed you
Much too long since I held you tight
Tonight, yes, tonight you'll be mine
I've been told about your kisses
And I've thought about you every night
Tonight, yes, tonight, you'll be mine
I've made up my mind
Not to be left on the shelf
Now I'm sure to find you
And keep you to myself
I just think about you every day
When you're near and when you're far away
Tonight, yes, tonight, you'll be mine
I've made up my mind
Not to be left on the shelf
Now I'm sure to find you
And keep you to myself
I just think about you every day
When you're near and when you're far away
Tonight, yes, tonight, you'll be mine
