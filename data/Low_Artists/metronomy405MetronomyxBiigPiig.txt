Put my head on a pillow
And I watch you singing "Blue Moon" on the drive home (on the drive home)
(On the drive home, on the drive home)
You smiled in the mirror with those bright eyes
And you froze time, you're an old soul (you're an old soul)
(You're an old soul, you're an old soul)
How'd I miss the sweetest gaze
All those times you looked my way?
I don't know (my way I don't-)
(I don't know, I don't know)
'Cause I ran off in the wrong direction
Looking for love when you were stood right there
Under my nose
You gave me your sweater in the late day
Watching rain pour, then you came in close (then you came in close)
(Then you came in close, then you came in close)
You taste like vanilla and your hand's soft
Holding my cheek, you're an angel (you're an angel)
(You're an angel, you're an angel)
How'd I ever lose my way
With all those times you called my name?
I don't know (my name, I don't know)
(I don't know)
'Cause I ran off in the wrong direction
Looking for love when you were stood right there
