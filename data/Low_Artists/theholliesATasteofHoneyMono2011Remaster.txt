A taste of honey
Tastin' much sweeter than wine
Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart
And lingers still, though we're far apart
A taste of honey (Honey, honey)
Tastin' much sweeter
I dream of your first kiss and then
I feel upon your lips and then
A taste of honey (Honey, honey)
Tastin' much sweeter
I will return, yes, I will return
I'll come back for the honey
I will return, yes, I will return
I'll come back for the honey
And you
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you
Whoa, whao, whoa, whoa, whoa, you
