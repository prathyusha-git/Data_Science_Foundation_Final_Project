She said I'm trouble and I know
I'm just a fuck up feeling low
Not even Chris could fix me now
So can I stay a while
He said I'm no good and it's true
A sinking ship without a crew
And if you let me hang around
We'll burn the past right down to the ground
I'm gonna follow where you go
Down every valley broken road
Through every wild and lonely night
Hold me tight
Wherever you go I will follow
Whooooo
Follollollollow
Whooooo
Follollollollow
Whooooo
Follolloll
Ollow
Whooooo
Follollollollow
A different day a different crime
I'll do my best I'll walk the line
A naked flame out in the cold
Is gonna guide you home
They say we're no good and it's true
A sinking ship without a crew
And if you let me hang around
We'll burn the past right down to the ground
I'm gonna follow where you go
Down every valley broken road
Through every wild and lonely night
Hold me tight
Wherever you go I will follow
Whooooo
Follollollollow
Whooooo
Follollollollow
Whooooo
Follolloll
Ollow
Whooooo
Follollollollow
Whooooo
Follollollollow
Whooooo
Follollollollow
Whooooo
Follolloll
Ollow
Whooooo
Follollollollow
