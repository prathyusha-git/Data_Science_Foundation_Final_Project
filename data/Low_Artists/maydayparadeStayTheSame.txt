Well you said you were embarrassed to be alone
In a crowded room with strangers
Hoping someone would come and say hello
And be your mighty savior
To take you somewhere else, could be anywhere
Just as long as it is far from here
When the season ends you'll be all alone
Wondering why things can't just stay
Stay the same

Stay the same

Well I thought it would be nice just to walk with you
Together through the garden
Trying to hold it all as we went along
Until there was no more room for
The pieces that didn't fit anyway
Though you did all that you could to save them all
There was never a way to save them all
Stay the same

Don't you change for anybody or anything
(I don't really care where you came from)
The way everything else does
(As long as you don't have to go back soon)
Stay the same
(I don't really care where you came from)
Always
(As long as you don't have to go back soon)
Spinning so hard, sometimes I wanna get off
Of a callous world as it falls apart
Like it's got a reason to
(Everybody needs one)
I'll give you a reason to stay
(I don't really care where you came from)
(As long as you don't have to go back soon)
Stay the same
(I don't really care where you came from)
(As long as you don't have to go back soon)
Don't you change for anybody or anything

Stay the same
(I don't really care where you came from)
Always
