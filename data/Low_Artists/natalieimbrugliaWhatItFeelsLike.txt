All night
Been staring into headlights
Thinking 'bout what I left behind
I don't need it no more
All my life
People telling me what's right
This time I draw my own lines
I've never been so sure
You got me feeling a whole lot better
I found a way to fly above the weather
Thirty thousand feet up here I can see
Oh, just how it's supposed to be
Now I know what it feels like (ooh)
Thinking I could be ready to give up the fight (ooh)
Now I know what it feels like to love somebody like I love you (ooh)
Now I know what it feels like (ooh)
Thinking I could be ready to give up the fight
Now I know what it feels like to love somebody like I love you
Lately
Doesn't feel like I'm waiting
Such a colorful daydream (ooh)
Just this nothing more (nothing more)
Mm, there is so much I wanna say
Words don't come out but you see my face
You know like I know, I've never been so sure (ooh)
Now I know what it feels like (ooh)
Thinking I could be ready to give up the fight (ooh)
Now I know what it feels like to love somebody like I love you (ooh)
Now I know what it feels like (ooh)
Thinking I could be ready to give up the fight
Now I know what it feels like to love somebody like I love you (ooh)
Like I love ya
Like I love ya
To love somebody like I love you
Like I love ya
Like I love ya
Like I love ya
To love somebody like I love you
Now I know what it feels like
Thinking I could be ready to give up the fight
Now I know what it feels like to love somebody like I love you (ooh)
Now I know what it feels like (ooh)
Thinking I could be ready to give up the fight (ooh)
Now I know what it feels like to love somebody like I love you
Like I love ya
There is so much I wanna say
Like I love ya
Words don't come out but you see my face
Like I love ya
You know like I know, you know like I know
Like I love ya
To love somebody like I love you
