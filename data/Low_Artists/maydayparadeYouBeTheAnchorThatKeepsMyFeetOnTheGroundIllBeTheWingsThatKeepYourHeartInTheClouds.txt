And honestly I have been begging for answers
That you and only you can give to me
My voice crying loud
I've been crying for days now
And as I start to run, I stop to breathe
(And I was nearly scared to death)
And I was nearly scared to death
(By what you left in paragraphs)
By what you left in paragraphs
(The words were nearly over us)
The words were nearly over us
You stop and turn and grab your bags
And I'll be here by the ocean
Just waiting for proof that there's sunsets and silhouette dreams
All my sand castles fall like the ashes of cigarettes
And every wave drags me to sea
I could stand here for hours
Just to ask God the question, "Is everyone here make-believe?"
With a tear in His voice, He says, "Son, that's the question"
Does this deafening silence mean nothing to no one but me?
♪
As hours move to minutes
And minutes take longer to break
I will be desperately awaiting
When my tongue won't fall apart
And we've been sitting here for hours
All alone and in the dark
So let me think of to word it
Is it too soon to say "perfect"?
If I could find another thirty minutes somewhere
I'm sure everything would find me
All that's left is just to sing
I'll be here by the ocean
Just waiting for proof that there's sunsets and silhouette dreams
All my sand castles fall like the ashes of cigarettes
And every wave drags me to sea
I could stand here for hours
Just to ask God the question, "Is everyone here make-believe?"
With a tear in His voice, He says, "Son, that's the question"
Does this deafening silence mean nothing to no one (but me?)
And if you sing to me sweet until then
I may never sail Virginia again
And as this current moves slow for me
This much you must know we'll meet again
And I'll have you know I'm scared to death
Tell me once again
That you will love me to the death
And should I die, you swear that you will come for me
As I fade away, you reach out your hand
(And please don't let me go) And please don't let me go
(And please don't let me go) And please don't let me go
And I'll be here by the ocean
Just waiting for proof that there's sunsets and silhouette dreams
All my sand castles fall like the ashes of cigarettes
And every wave drags me to sea
I could stand here for hours
Just to ask God the question, "Is everyone here make-believe?"
With a tear in His voice, He says, "Son, that's the question"
Does this deafening silence mean nothing to no one but me?
