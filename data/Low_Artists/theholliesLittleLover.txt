You leave me sad and lonely
Sitting here, oh, so blue
Since you went and told me, baby
Yeah, that we're through
Now baby, come on (Come on, little lover)
Yeah, come on (Come on, little lover)
Yeah, come on, little lover
Come on and discover
My love for you
(Oh, come on)
Trying to forget you
Getting you out of my mind
I'm gonna search all over this world and
Find some other kind
Now some other lover (Come on, little lover)
Some other lover (Come on, little lover)
Yeah, come on, little lover
Come on and discover
My love for you
♪
Writing you a letter
Feeling, oh, so blue
I've been crying my heart out, baby
Since you said we're through
Now baby, come on (Come on, little lover)
Yeah, come on (Come on, little lover)
Yeah, come on, little lover
Come on and discover
My love for you
