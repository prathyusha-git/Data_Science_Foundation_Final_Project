Yo do the knowledge to the master builder blowin the spliff
The new millenium, Hiram Abiff
Gotta watch what I say to you niggas so I code my sation
Cause the shit ain't really past the statute of limitations
The streets still hollerin bout how strong I am
Niggas I hurt still holler bout how wrong I am
As a little nigga broke bakin soda and coke
Had me amazed how my steady hand kept it afloat
Let it sit, cool it hard and hit the set cool and heartless
In front of the store projects, long as I made a profit
I see you eyein me, your fire escape diary
Filled with pages of episodes of shi'in me
Nonbeliever my hammer for hire
Hit your ass so close that your coat will catch fire
Dog the stakes are dire, I'm no liar
Holdin court in the street B, cause I got priors
Same team no games, keep chicks that blow brains
Rather rock Soul Train than corners rockin cocaine
Got no shame, tryin to build these figures
Headquarters left, he ain't gone he still wit us
Not in the physical, through us he live
I can see him with Big L, Pun, Pac and B.I.G
Watchin over the kid like yeah Shigg the wait's over
Inhale our ether, blow out and take over
I'm the truth, give you proof at your video shoot
Pull them cannons on you, while them cameras on you
How you love that, don't wanna bump with Stax
So go 'head dumb up, make me call Crum up
It's the Militia, y'all niggas don't know bout I
Got me heated frustrated bout to blow my high
Me and Benz blazin, Rage got the gauge raisin
Sick of talkin bout it niggas ain't on my wavelength
United we stand together, down for whatever
Divided we get at you from all angles, Gang Starr forbidden
N.Y.G. same team no games
Love is love fam one and the same
Funny style niggas act strange
Goin against the grain
Don't wanna see us on top our thing
We adapt to change
Fame fortune and material gain
Flow stay natural unrestrained
Let me explain, niggas don't get it til you set it aflame
Subject 'em to pain, make 'em respect the name
The set you rep, connect you claim
Stay ready to bang
Step ahead of competitors they'll test your aim
H. Stax shoot back splat dead your brain
My foundation bust gats splat dead your brain
Fuck with mine splat and I'll take the blame
Playin for keeps we came to win
Yo I'm the Jerry Rice to this, much too nice to quit
And just so you know he never liked you kid
Cause you ain't wanna let niggas eat
So I'mma convene with my team
Before we gotta let the trigger speak
Cause nowadays, y'all rappers are carbon copies
Your bars are sloppy, still it's hard to stop me
Especially when I connect with my man
Rep for my fam we takin back the rest of our land
And we don't really care if they say you the shit
They're playin your hits, we bout to make our way in this bitch
And let's see if your gimmick lasts to the next season
In a flash take your stupid ass out, give me the next reason
Flip for my peoples here, spit for my peoples here
Yeah, time to get rich with my peoples here
Cut off a snake's head then we break bread
Same team no games, you on the ground tryin to fake dead
Let the games begin
