Now I see you and you laugh, my friend
Didn't I tell you so, you say
I just want to be alone, my friend
Will you please, just go away
Today goes on like any other day
It doesn't know, it doesn't care
Never knew what loneliness could mean
Having love and then despair
Goodbye tomorrow, I'm leaving you today
Goodbye tomorrow
Don't you be grieving 'cause I'm leaving?
It won't matter to you anyway
♪
Now it's over, what am I to do?
Will I find the love of you?
Can I be sure she'll know what loving means?
Can someone else love like you?
Goodbye tomorrow, I'm leaving you today
