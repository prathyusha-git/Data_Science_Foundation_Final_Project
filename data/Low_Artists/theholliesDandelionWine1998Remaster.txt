Stoned all the time, dandelion wine
What else can I do?
I've been this way everyday
But now that we're through
Do I love you?
You can bet your life
That I do, do, do
Do I love you?
I would drink my wine
From your shoe, shoe, shoe
Stoned all the time on dandelion wine
It's all down to you
I've been this way everyday
I'm thinking of you
Do I love you?
You can bet your life
That I do, do, do
Do I love you?
I would drink my wine
From your shoe, shoe, shoe
