I don't know
Why I insist on asking
No one else
Can ever make you happy
What am I missing
If there's nothing anyway?
Well there's no
Need to explain
You just don't
Feel the same
What reasons could one provide?
Will I ever be satisfied?
I can't get enough of feeling lonely
I can't get enough of feeling lonely
I can't get enough of feeling lonely
I can't get enough of feeling lonely
I can't get enough of feeling lonely
