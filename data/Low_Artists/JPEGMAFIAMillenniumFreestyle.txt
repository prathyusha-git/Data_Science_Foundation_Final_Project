Fire and ash
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
At night I, at night I think of you
I want to be your baby, you know you want me too
And if your game is on, got to give me a call boo
And if your love is strong, got to give my all too
And if my baby is wrong, I got that thing tucked inside
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're not black, so drop the racism crap
Girl, you should know that, I got a pound on me
And I'm on probation so they gonna violate me
Cholo, cholo, cholo
Fuck the beat, let my ends speak, yeah
Fuck the streets let this Benz speak (Talk!)
Veterans and we ten deep, huh
Fuck me in the right way (The right way)
Get me booked for the nice dates (Fuck)
Oh, man, I'm a soloist (Okay!)
Can't break no bread with no label, bitch!
No, you cannot have my masters, no
Cause I made that beat from scratch, bitch, no
Where the fuck do they do that shit? No
Yeah, you are my fire, the one desire
Believe when I say, I want it thataway
I hate your bloodline, I can't make shoreline
I won't when I say, I want it thataway, for real, for real, for real
(You finally called me)
Ain't nothing but a heartache, ain't nothing but a mistake
I never wanna hear you say, I want it that way (For real, for real)
I never wanna hear you say, I want it that way
The answer is, you're not black, so drop the racism crap
