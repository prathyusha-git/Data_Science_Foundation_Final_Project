Something's got a hold on me
Yeah, must be love
Whoah, something's got a hold on me right now, yeah
Yeah, must be love
Well, I got a feeling and I feel so strange
And everything about me seems to have changed
Step by step I gotta find me a walk
I even sound different when I talk
I said oh, oh, oh, wow
Something's got a hold on me and it must be love
Something's got a hold on me
Yeah, must be love
Whoah, something's got a hold on me right now, yeah
Yeah, must be love
Well, I never felt this way before
Something's got a hold on me and won't let go
Believe I'd fly just a whole day for you
It sounds so strange, but it sure feels good
I said oh, oh, oh, wow
Something's got a hold on me and it must be love
Well, now my heart feels heavy and my feet feel light
I shake all over, but I feel all right
I never thought this could happen to me
Well, I'm in heaven, when I'm in misery
Well, I never thought this could be this way
Well, I know, baby, that this is the day
Well, I never thought it could be this way
But now you're gone, it's been a-hurtin' on me
I said oh, oh, oh, wow
Something's got a hold on me and it must be love
You know it's like love
Talks like love
Yeah, it feels all right
You know I feel all right
Walk like love, now
Yeah, walks like love
I'm a-talkin' about love, yeah, yeah, yeah
Know about love
I feel all right now
Feel all right, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, walks like love
Talks like love, all right, yeah
Something's got a hold on me
Yeah, must be love
Whoah, something's got a hold on me right now, yeah
Yeah, must be love
I never felt this way before
Something's got a hold on me and won't let go
Believe I'd fly to just a whole day for you
It sounds so strange, but it sure feels good
I said oh, oh, oh, wow
Something's got a hold on me and it must be love
Yeah, it must be love
Oh, it must be love
