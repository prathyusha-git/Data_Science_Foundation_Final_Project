(Ransford)
Fifi the flea fell in love
With a clown from a flea circus fair
She gave him her heart
But he still couldn't see
That for such a long time she had cared
He put himself 'round all the other girl fleas
Unaware that he hurt her so badly
She cried in the arms of his manager friend
And declared that she loved the clown madly
One day Fifi went
And this drove the clown wild
The poor little flea started crying
Never you mind his manager said
I ought not to tell but she's dyin'
Dyin' for love of you little flea
You've broken her heart with your lyin'
She couldn't stand to see you throw
Her love away without tryin'
The day Fifi died the little clown vowed
He'd tend her grave every hour
He broke down and cried
When he saw her grave
And on it he placed a small flower
Poor little flea he wasted away
He'd lost his Fifi forever
So they opened her grave
Put him inside
Now at last they are together
