What's wrong with the way I live

The way I use my time
People should live their lives
Leaving me to mine, leaving me to mine

I'm a man who is defending
All his rights to live in peace
And my job is never ending
But they're losing, losing
What's wrong with the way I live
The way I use my time
People should live their lives
Leaving me to mine, leaving me to mine
And they're losing
