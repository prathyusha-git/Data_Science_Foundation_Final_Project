There is yet another one that follows me
Wherever I go and supports me
Oh, this tooth is warmth-like
This tooth is warmth-like
This tooth is warmth-like
And these teeth are a ladder up to her mouth
Oh, these teeth are a ladder that I walk
That you can walk too if you want
If you want up to the mouth
Mouth's cradle
The mouth's cradle
She always has a hope for me
Always sees me when nothing else
And everyone have left
Oh, the ghost is brighter than anyone
And fulfills me with hope
These beams assure me
And you can use these teeth as a ladder
Up to mouth's cradle, mouth's cradle
You can follow these notes I'm singing
Up to the mouth's cradle
The simplicity of the ghost-like beast
The purity of what it wants and where it goes
Always love, always loves you, always loves you
With infra-red love
