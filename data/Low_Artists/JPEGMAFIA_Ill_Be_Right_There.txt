Ay, bitch, I'm back outside
They gettin' surprised when they hearin' these beats like epiphanies
Back and forth with this African booty scratcher
I left all of that talkin' for bitches, B
I was at the château with the blower
You said you would show, but you never did shit to me
If you showed for that face, that face wouldn't be shit but some shots
And stained MOWALOLA tees
This bitch text other men, sending pics of me
He talk shit with his friend, send that shit to me
That bitch only online, she ain't real to me
They is what niggas think I'm supposed to be
It's so funny, you claimin' you tough, but you can't back it up
But you back it and post at me
I done had that boy face down, ass up
Like yo' baby mama be, uh (I'll be right there for you)
Fuck these niggas, I'm spazzin'
Hittin' that ho 'til I gave her a heart attack
I just told that bitch, "Seeyuh," she think Carti back
I put creativity back on the map
I be spittin' that dope like it's '80s crack
Fuck you, you ain't gettin' no cash back
He see daddy and then he get flashbacks
You keep yappin', I'll open my Cash App
Bald head in the sack
Bitch, I go Amber Rose with these MAGA raps
Yeah, I stand on that shit, ain't no backin' back
I don't care what you feel, I ain't factor that, and that's real
Barry Sanders, every run is a reel
Colonel Sanders, keep the recipe sealed
These niggas connected like Bronny, for real
That nepotism won't help you in the field (I'll be right-)
I let it hit
Brewin' that coffee, I'm takin' a sip
Everybody thinkin' Peggy sweet
Thinkin' it's Splenda 'til I let it rip
Y'all niggas thinkin' you one step ahead
This me lettin' you know that I'm hip
Y'all keep on thinkin' I'm playin' the hand I was dealt
Yeah, until the same hand get a grip on that bitch
Y'all want none of them problems
Y'all want none them issues (issues)
None of your people gon' miss you (miss you)
You're better off with a tissue (tissue)
Loaded the rocket with missiles
She catchin' a tip like a stripper
I had issues with my barber (I'll be right there for you)
You got issues with the clippers
