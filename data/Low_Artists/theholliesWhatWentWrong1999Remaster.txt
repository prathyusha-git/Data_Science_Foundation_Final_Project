If you could look my way you'd know that I exist
And then you'd realize that I'm waiting to be kissed
By you, baby
Tell me what went wrong with our love (Love)
Each time that you walk by I feel my heart would break
And then I think about the pain I'd have to take
From you, baby
Tell me what went wrong with our love
You'd be the only reason that I'm leaving town
You'd be the only reason why I'd come back for one more day
Why I'd come back and maybe stay
If I could find out what to say to you

You'd be the only reason that I'm leaving town
You'd be the only reason why I'd come back for one more day
Why I'd come back and maybe stay
If I could find out what to say to you
So I'll just pretend that you will look my way
And I am hoping that you'll come to me and say
Tell me, baby
Tell me what went wrong with our love
With our love
With our love
