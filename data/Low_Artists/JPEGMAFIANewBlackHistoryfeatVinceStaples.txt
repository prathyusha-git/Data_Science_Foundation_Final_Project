9 millimeter, my brother's my keeper
Was serving that ether before I did features
My mamacita, she know how to greet me
She know how to keep me, she bett' not get greedy
I hit the lottery, I hit the lottery, I hit the lottery
I hit the-, I hit-, I hit the- (uh, uh)
Let's resume, walk light when the elephant in the room
Porsche truck, hold whatever niggas need to boombaye
But the squabble will be over soon
I say what I do, and I mean what I wanna do (uh-huh)
These are my gangster chronicles
I'm the God MC, I'm the tried and true
Try me and you'll dream in the ICU
Time to show and prove, I guess
Time to bust a new move, I guess
Scrollin' through the tube at K. West
Seen myself on the news, so blessed
Dudes don't get this good 'til they death
Rugs from Italy, must be kiddin' me
North Side Long Beach, aborigines
Can't get rid of me, we Black history
9 millimeter, my brother's my keeper
Was serving that ether before I did features
My mamacita, she know how to greet me
She know how to keep me, she bett' not get greedy
I hit the lottery (Northside), I hit the lottery, I hit the lottery
I hit the-, I hit-, I hit the- (uh, uh)
When I come around, better stare at the floor (yeah)
'Cause I'm in that mode, on my own, I got that flavor, Jonathan Major paper
'Specially when y'all cashing out for PDFs and rapers (no Drizzy)
I hope y'all paid attention, no, really, I die
And I killed myself, tell 'em they killed me (hey)
I'm in a rush to fuck up, y'all wish I used my background as a- (ah)
Y'all wish I kept on eatin' prison lunch
'Cause I'm tweetin' too much, keepin' it a G is a must
These rappers fell off, they in status makin' statements, they status is peeing in cups
Ain't nobody freer than us
Ganando dinero como CM Punk (hey)
