Love can make a fool of you
You'll do anything it wants you to
Love can make you feel so good
When it goes like you think it should
Or it can make you cry at night
When your baby don't treat you right
When you're feelin' sad and blue
You know love's made a fool of you

You know love makes fools of men
But you don't care, you're gonna try it again
Time goes by, it's passin' fast
You think true lovin' has come at last
But by and by you're gonna find
Your crazy lovin' has made you blind
When you're feelin' sad and blue
You know love's made a fool of you
