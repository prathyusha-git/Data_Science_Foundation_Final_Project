It's crazy, right?
Listen, listen, listen, I'm from New York City, right?
I'm from the five boroughs
It's the fact—listen, when I was a little nigga growing up
When I met this nigga, him and Guru, right? (Mmm-hmm)
It probably—what was that, '87, '88? ('88)
'88, I was 16, 17 years old
I was gettin' money in Baltimore, I'm from the Bronx (Okay)
So, I respected niggas from outta town coming to another town tryin' to get money (A'ight)
Feel me? So that's what clicked me with Gang Starr
I thought Guru, God bless him, was my little man
That nigga was ten years older than me
I'm from outside (Okay)
And I thought that, you know
I come from the era where rappers wasn't really, uh, admired the way they are now
You feel me? (Right) Them niggas was entertainers to us (Mmm-hmm)
We was fuckin' with niggas who threw stones at the penitentiary (Right)
Alright, so, when I got with Gang Starr, it was like
"Yo, I like these niggas, they from outta town, they came here to get money
And they doing they thing, I fuck with them"
Then when they blew, it was, "Ah, that's dope, they blew
These niggas is legends"
