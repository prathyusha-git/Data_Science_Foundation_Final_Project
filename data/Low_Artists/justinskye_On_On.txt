Right about now
We just started but oh damn this slaps
The DJ might just have to run this back
This be [?] like a heart attack
Can someone please tell me where Brooklyn at?
Ain't nobody on the wall in here
You with your man, but girl, see no one cares
I just came out here to have some fun
And I ain't worrying 'bout anyone
See all that I want is tonight to get crazy
I ain't going home and nobody can't make me
I just came out here tonight to have a good time
All day, all night, all day, all night
And the party don't stop 'til the sun come in the morning
So as soon as this drops, you gon' wanna get it poppin'
And nobody can stop us from doing what we're doing
It goes on and on and on (on and on)
And it's always turnt up like tomorow's never coming
Turn down for what? This the life and yeah I love it
Every minute, every hour of the day we keep it running
It goes on and on and on (on and on)
We gon' part like it's Project X
So you already know exactly what is next
There's a little bit of everything in here
Police tryna shut us down but we don't care
Now all my homies holdin' records in their hands
Tomorrow night we hope to do it all again
Oh yeah we gone, yeah we so gone
And I just hope this turn up never ends
See all that I want is tonight to get crazy
I ain't going home and nobody can't make me
I just came out here tonight to have a good time
All day, all night, all day, all night
And the party don't stop 'til the sun come in the morning
So as soon as this drops, you gon' wanna get it poppin'
And nobody can stop us from doing what we're doing
It goes on and on and on (on and on)
And it's always turnt up like tomorrow's never coming
Turn down for what? This the life and yeah I love it
Every minute, every hour of the day we keep it running
It goes on and on and on (on and on)
It just goes on and on and one
So I'ma do what i want, I'ma say what I want, I'ma kiss who I want, and I don't give a fuck what anybody thinks about it. Think I'm crazy now, i'm gonna keep on going on and on baby, on and on
And the party don't stop 'til the sun come in the morning
So as soon as this drops, you gon' wanna get it poppin'
And nobody can stop us from doing what we're doing
It goes on and on and on (on and on)
And it's always turnt up like tomorow's never coming
Turn down for what? This the life and yeah I love it
Every minute, every hour of the day we keep it running
It goes on and on and on (on and on)
