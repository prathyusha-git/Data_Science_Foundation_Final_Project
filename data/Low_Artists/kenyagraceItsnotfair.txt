One, two, three
All the nights in summertime
I was yours and you were mine
We were young, I was dumb
Now you're happy and you moved on
In my head, I can't forget
All the stupid shit you said
And it's not fair, you don't care
But I see you everywhere
It's not fair
That you're polite to friends of mine
You were always the one they liked
I called them up when we were done
I swear they took it as hard as us
And my mom said she saw you
Stood with somebody new
She said, "What went wrong with you two?"
Well, I wish I knew
In my head, I can't forget
All the stupid shit you said
And it's not fair, you don't care
But I see you everywhere
In my head, I can't forget
All the words you never meant
And it's not fair, you don't care
But I see you everywhere
It's not fair
It's not fair
It's not fair
It's not fair
So tell me, truly, do you think about me?
Are you happy with some other girl?
Tell me, baby, don't you kinda miss me?
I hope you picture me when you're with her
In my head, I can't forget
All the stupid shit you said
And it's not fair, you don't care
But I see you everywhere
It's not fair
It's not fair
It's not fair
Oh
In my head, I can't forget
All the stupid shit you said
And it's not fair, you don't care
But I see you everywhere
It's not fair
It's not fair
It's not fair
Oh
It's not fair
