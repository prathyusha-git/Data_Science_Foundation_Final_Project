Heard you gotta move a mountain
Here's how you do
First you gotta let go
Of the lie that it's too big for you
When you see a mountain, picture a hill
Keep taking one more step until
You can look behind you and see how far
How high and just how big you are
You can love harder like a fire starter
You can fill any space
You can grow taller, make the fear smaller
Stare the truth in the face
I know that you can, I know you will
You can do anything
♪
If you knew you were gonna win
How would you play?
If you knew whatever hand you were dealt
The game would go your way
You would play bolder, cause you would know
You have more than what might show
Belief gives you courage so find your faith
Don't walk soft, Don't play safe
You can love harder like a fast starter
You can fill any space
You can grow taller, make the fear smaller
Stare the truth in the face
I know that you can, I know you will
There is a plan you will fulfill
You can do anything
