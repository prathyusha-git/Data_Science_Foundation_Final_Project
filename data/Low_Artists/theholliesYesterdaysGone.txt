In the city where no one speaks
Where people live in just to make ends meet
And looking back over the shoulders
At the road, this should be on
It gets me wishing, I could catch a way
Right out of nowhere and be on my way
I'm drinking red wine and the sunshine
Is sleeping away too long
Life's a strange, things can change
Ain't that the way?
You think you've got it figured out
It blows you away
Yesterday's gone, baby, don't you know?
You'll never get it back, gonna let it go
Yesterday's gone, it's a one night show
But you got tomorrow, yeah
Yesterday's gone, look at how you roam
You never give it up 'cause you're not alone
Yesterday's gone, don't ever hold up, stomp
And yeah, yeah, yeah
Ain't it a pity the way we live?
Always thinking that there's more than this
Just getting sick and tired of trying find
Someone else he can get along
We're reminiscing about the long lost days
Like a movie that I might replay
When everyday lasted a lifetime
And summer went on and on
Life's a strange, things can change
Ain't that the way?
You think you've got it figured out
It blows you away
Yesterday's gone, baby, don't you know?
You'll never get it back, gonna let it go
Yesterday's gone, it's a one night show
But you got tomorrow, yeah
Yesterday's gone, look at how you roam
You never give it up 'cause you're not alone
Yesterday's gone, don't ever hold up, stomp
And yeah, yeah, yeah
Yesterday's gone, baby, don't you know?
You'll never get it back, gonna let it go
Yesterday's gone, it's a one night show
But you got tomorrow, yeah
Yesterday's gone, look at how you roam
You never give it up 'cause you're not alone
Yesterday's gone, don't ever hold up, stomp
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yesterday's gone, don't you know?
You'll never get it back, gonna let it go
Yesterday's gone, it's a one night show
But you got tomorrow, yeah
Yesterday's gone, look at how you roam
You never give it up 'cause you're not alone
Yesterday's gone, don't ever hold up, stomp
