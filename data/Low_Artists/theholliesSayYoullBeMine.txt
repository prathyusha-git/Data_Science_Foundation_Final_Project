Thinkin' about you
How it would be if I could live without you
Something I just can't seem to visualize
When I look into your eyes
I only hear the words I want to hear
Why don't you say that you'll be mine forever and ever?
You don't have to tell the truth
But I want you to say that you're mine
Say that you'll be mine forever and ever
Let me live a fantasy, darling, lie to me
Won't you please say that you're mine?
Deep inside me
I hear a woman's voice speak softly to me
Asking how I could ever be so blind
I've been trying to read your mind
Why don't you say the words I want to hear?
Why don't you say that you'll be mine forever and ever?
You don't have to tell the truth
But I want you to say that you're mine
Say that you'll be mine forever and ever
Let me live a fantasy, darling, lie to me
Won't you please say that you're mine?
I'm doing all I can to make you see
Ooh, babe, what you do to me
Don't you know my heart's in jeopardy?
The effect you're having over me
Say that you'll be mine forever and ever
You don't have to tell the truth
But I want you to say that you're mine
Say that you'll be mine forever and ever
Let me live a fantasy, darling, lie to me
Won't you please say it?
Say that you'll be mine forever and ever
You don't have to tell the truth
But I want you to say that you're mine
Say that you'll be mine forever and ever
Let me live a fantasy, darling, lie to me
Won't you please say it?
