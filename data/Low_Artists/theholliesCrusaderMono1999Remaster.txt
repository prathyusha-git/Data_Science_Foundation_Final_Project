All is dark
The moat is dry
Shadows fall
The roof lets in the sky
All these memories go round in my head
Of the life I have led
Minstrels play
Familiar melodies
And once more
The past comes back to me
All these memories go round in my head
Of the life I have led
The grass has grown much taller now
Overrunning everything
Oh, oh, since I've been gone
The grass has grown much taller now
Overrunning everything
Oh, oh, what have I done?
The grass has grown much taller now
Overrunning everything
Oh, oh, since I've been gone
The grass has grown much taller now
Overrunning everything
Oh, oh, what have I done?
All is dark
The moat is dry
Shadows fall
The roof lets in the sky
All these memories go round in my head
Of the life I have led
