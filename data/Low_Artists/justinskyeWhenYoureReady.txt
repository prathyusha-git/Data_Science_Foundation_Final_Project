Why's it always me, who's on the losing side?
Thought they said that love was free
But I know I'll pay the price, once or twice
So don't run, run, run
If there's a problem, I know we'll solve it
I know you'll solve it
I-I-I know, it's all about timing
Nobody has the answers
In your mind and your soul
You know your right from wrong
I don't want you to think you're all alone
Lets keep it natural, open doors, never close
Promise to set it free
I'll still wait for you (you)
Even though sometimes, it feels like we're giving up
Still stay for you (you)
Ain't had nobody give you this kinda love
Feels strange for you (you)
We fight, then we kiss, and then we make love
But I'm still made for you (you)
At the end of the day, don't wanna wake up without me
♪
Mmmmm, baby
Wanna know the words to say
Ahhh, ahhh, oh
(Ooh) wait, wait
Baby don't run away, yeah-ay
I don't know what to say, yeah
That'll just make you stay
(Ooh) wait, wait
Baby don't run away-ay-ay
I don't know what to say, yeah, yeah
That'll make you stay (make you stay)
In your mind and your soul
You know your right from wrong
I don't want you to think you're all alone
Lets keep it natural, open doors, never close
Promise to set it free
I'll still wait for you (you)
Even though sometimes, it feels like we're giving up
