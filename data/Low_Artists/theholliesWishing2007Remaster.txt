Wishing
Wishing that I could see you every day
Wishing that I could steal your heart away
Dreaming of a time I could hold you tight
Wishing that the time would come tonight
I've been hoping all along
Things would turn out right
If I could find a wishing star
Then I would spend the night
Wishing that I could see you every day
Wishing that I could steal your heart away
Then I could spend the night
Wishing that I could see you every day
Wishing that I could steal your heart away
Dreaming of a time I could hold you tight
Wishing that the time would come tonight
