You were right
And I don't want to be here
If you're gonna be there
Was that supposed to happen
I'll hold tight
I'll remember to smile
Though it has been a while
And without you does it matter
There's no room
No place to start
When our souls are apart
I want to travel through time
See your surprise
I'd hold you so tight
I'm counting down the days tonight
I just want to be a million miles away from here
I'm counting down the days
How've you been
It's just the usual here
And days are feeling like years
And every day's without you
Now I cry
Just a little too much
When i think of your touch
And everything about you
I feel cold
I'm in the dark
When our souls are apart
I want to travel through time
See your surprise
I'd hold you so tight
I'm counting down the days tonight
I just want to be a million miles away from here
I want to travel through time
See your surprise
I'd hold you so tight
I'm counting down the days tonight
I just want to be a million miles away from here
I'm counting down the days
I'm counting down the days
I'm counting down the days
I'm gonna be you surprise
I'm gonna hold you so tight
Yeah
I want to travel through time
See your surprise
I'd hold you so tight
I'm counting down the days tonight
I just want to be a million miles away from here
I want to travel through time
See your surprise
I'd hold you so tight
I'm counting down the days tonight
I just want to be a million miles away from here
A million miles away from here
