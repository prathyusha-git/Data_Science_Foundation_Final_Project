He opened up the door like, what are you here for
And I don't wanna hurt you so you should go
Cause the person I'm here with, you know
And I'm like, clearly you don't know me
Because I don't run away from collisions
Any easier than bad relationships or decisions
And why are we whispering in the hall?
Who's in there with you?
Why didn't you call?
He says, why didn't you call?
And I'm bawling now
Because I can't tell who he's protecting me
Or him, or her
And the rest is a blur
I'm running down a winding staircase
Through the lobby, onto the street
Running and running and the sound at my feet is water splashing
My world is crashing in the rain, and I realize
My life is a scene from a movie
Where I played the wrong part
Fell off of the screen when the villain, broke my heart
This night I will always remember, as the moment I learned
I'm best on the stage in a drama
Where love's returned
Last hour of the night before the morning light
When anyone who out ain't right
And I'm running alone, like a fool of my own
He's racing after me
Must have chosen to chase after me
So I let him catch me cause he left her there
Snatches my arm and says he wouldn't dare let me leave upset
It's okay well
Since we're putting on a show
I start screaming, let me go
He says no, he's holding
I'm folding, it's cold
And I'm heading to hurt him like he hurt me
Under the street light, in a fight
And the thunder claps my pain, and I realize
My life is a scene from a movie
Where I played the wrong part
Fell off of the screen when the villain, broke my heart
This night, I will always remember, as the moment I learn
I'm best on the stage in a drama
Where love's returned
Where love's returned
