You're high classed
Well, your taste is good
I know I can't love you like I know I should
But we've got a good understanding
Ah, we've got us
You wear good clothes
Ah, when I wear rags
You got educated friends
But we've got a good understanding
We've got us
We can't be seen in public
Oh, we gotta find lowly places to go
If they see me
Walking with you
Your friends'll cut you dead
I've seen it happen, I know
You eat caviar
Ah, when I eat toast
I know I can't buy you the things you like most
We've got a good understanding
We've got us
Ah, sing those songs
We can't be seen in public
Oh, we gotta find lowly places to go
If they see me
Walking with you
Your friends'll cut you dead
I've seen it happen, I know
You eat caviar
Ah, when I eat toast
I know I can't buy you the things you like most
We've got a good understanding
We've got us
Oh, yeah, aw, we've got us
Believe me
We've got us
