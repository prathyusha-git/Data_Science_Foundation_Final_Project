Did you lie, when you said you'd always be there for me
Did you care, when I said I'd walk out the door
Now is it me, or are things not how they used to be
'Cos deep in side, I'm feeling so unsure
Now I could run away and hide
But I'm still here by your side
But every time I try to say goodbye, you find a way to make me change my mind
Tell me how can I be sure your love is strong
I don't want to make the same mistake, there's only so much pain a heart can take
But every time I tell myself I can't go on, you prove me wrong
♪
When you dream, am I still the one in your fantasy
When we touch, does it feel the same as before
'Cause all I know is I can't give up so easily
There are times when I'm feeling insecure
Now I could run away tonight
But I'm still here by your side
But every time I try to say goodbye, you find a way to make me change my mind
Tell me how can I be sure your love is strong
I don't want to make the same mistake, there is only so much pain a heart can take
But every time I tell myself I can't go on, you prove me wrong
Prove me wrong, prove me wrong,
Prove me wrong, prove me wrong
Now I could run away tonight
But I'm still here by your side
Every time I try to say goodbye, you find a way to make me change my mind
Tell me how can I be sure your love is strong
I don't want to make the same mistakes, there is only so much pain a heart can take
But every time I tell myself I can't go on, you prove me wrong
Prove me wrong
You know I can't go on
You know I can't go on
You prove me wrong
How can I tell myself, you prove me wrong
