Yeah, The one and only Witt Lowry
Muthafuckers better not forget it
I've been paying my dues, and you barely given me credit
You been paying a label, I did it all independent
I said did I mention your girl she found me on Reddit
Your girl she found me authentic
That's something you wouldn't get
I'm allergic to fucking rappers, so i'm ill with a pen
I'm Ill to my friend, my one friend back in the day
You said okay go buy a mic, and write your soul on a page
I'm doing okay i'm doing just fine, I've been on my grind
A mastermind ahead of his time, that's why they left him behind
You fear the future, I'm the future in lines
I got the future in line, I'm only losing my time
I'm losing my mind, I'm trying to find a line into yours
Take your shots and i aint scared, not even par for the course
Fucking hungry you got food that i could never afford
Feed me, feed me, feed me, then feed me more
My middle finger to a rapper who scared to take me on tour
I don't need it I don't see it (?) galore
And when you left I didn't stress it I just opened the door
I've said it before team Witt until my death (?)
Still I came up from broken and hollow
To music and models she hoped for a follow
I'm feelin myself, I've been working all week
And I ain't gettin no sleep, they keep buying me drinks
But its bad for my health. I've got models half naked
Told mama id make it, your girl as she faces, stay real to myself
And i'm good now now, muthafucker I'm good now now, muthafucker I'm good
Talking about I'll be so famous if i hit 10 thou
And if I tweet something relevant i might get found
I think my girl might be pregnant man, i blew in her mouth
I losing her now, I'm using all your lyrics to cope
I know I said that you were garbage man, but really you're dope
I had to cope with the after high school I'm a joke
And I'm losing hope because my only skill is drinkin and smoke
(?) you don't wanna see what happened to Witt I learned how to flip the script
While I was working for Vince
Had your dream job before i started rapping and shit
Gave it away so i could save a generation of kids, its been a minute since i came
And Invented this shit, stealing my style and my lyrics that makes you my bitch
Now I'm the shit, you're the piss I let sit on the rim
My future is bright, your future is dim
You're waiting for my next single so you can go steal it again
Still I came up from broken and hollow
To music and models she hoped for a follow
I'm feelin myself, I've been working all week
And I ain't gettin no sleep, they keep buying me drinks
But its bad for my health. I've got models half naked
Told mama id make it, your girl as she faces, stay real to myself
And i'm good now now, muthafucker I'm good now now, muthafucker I'm good
Now if life's nothing but a bitch
Hope my dick is big enough to fuck the whole world, my old girl
You're new girl, could have a
Been focused on places and people that really matter
My team is going where i'm going i'm holding up both of the ladders
My pockets are getting fatter, and filled with bills i'm in debt
So funny that we think money is the key to success
Or that intelligence is something you can prove with a test
You said i was less, i'm here to prove to all y'all i'm the best
I got rap in a mess, and talking about the chain on my chest
Or talking about the money, power and was all i can flex
Its fucking lazy and you hate me time to pay me my rent
Now fucking face me when you pay, better fucking pay me respect
So tell me who next, a puppet with no talent go figure
You try to squash a Caterpillar, but my vision was bigger
And now amazed we went from nothing, to you posting a picture
Unanimous victor were working while you're hurting from the (?)
Still I came up from broken and hollow
To music and models she hoped for a follow
I'm feelin myself, I've been working all week
And I ain't gettin no sleep, they keep buying me drinks
But its bad for my health. I've got models half naked
Told mama id make it, your girl as she faces, stay real to myself
And i'm good now now, muthafucker I'm good now now, muthafucker I'm good
Still I came up from broken and hollow
To music and models she hoped for a follow
I'm feelin myself, I've been working all week
And I ain't gettin no sleep, they keep buying me drinks
But its bad for my health. I've got models half naked
Told mama id make it, your girl as she faces, stay real to myself
And i'm good now now, muthafucker I'm good now now, muthafucker I'm good
