Every day I wake up
Hoping you might call
You might call
Counting each mistake like
It was all my fault
All my fault
Said you'd never leave
Then hung me out to dry
The only time we talk
Is when we start to fight
You know you're bad at love
Bad at love
Seems as if you can't get enough
You know you're bad at love
Bad at love
Go on and tear me down in such a beautiful way
Waiting for the answers
Calling down the line
Down the line
Tracing over outlines
Searching for a sign
Searching for a sign
Said you'd never leave
Whether wrong or right
You're every other thought
Always on my mind
You know you're bad at love
Bad at love
Seems as if you can't get enough
You know you're bad at love
Bad at love
Go on and tear me down in such a beautiful way
And nothing is safe, yeah
Pull me down from these clouds
You know you're bad at love
Bad at love
Tell me before we burn out
What will you do with me now?
