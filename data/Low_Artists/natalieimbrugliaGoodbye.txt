Everyday's the same, I feel them merge
I try to separate, resist the urge
But they tell me I'll be fine
That it will all get better
Just try to write it down
Or put it in a letter
But the words won't play
And there's no easy way to say
Goodbye
Goodbye
Keep my head on straight and don't look down
With all I've pushed away, I'm losing ground
But they tell me I'll be fine
That it will all get better
Just try to write it down
Or put it in a letter
But the words won't play
Cause there's no easy way to say
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
And from the sidelines watch me fall down
♪
And I don't understand the things I do
But I'll probably be fine
As long as I keep moving
I'll try to write it down
So things just keep improving
Still the words wont play
Cause there's no easy way to say
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
