I wants to know what your doin' tonight
Wish I could see if everything was alright
Hold you long in my arms until it's light
Your smilin' face would make a wonderful sight
I wants to be with ya, love with ya, eat with ya,
sleep with ya, stay with me all of my life
I loved ya darlin' when ya's only sixteen
Was the sweetest thing to enter my dream
When we're together then my life is fulfilled
I love you darlin' I know I always will
I wants to be with ya, love with ya, eat with ya,
sleep with ya, stay with me all of my life
♪
I close my letter but never my love
Take it there to ya heaven above
Get me back to you safe and sound
The day that I leave the prisoners ground
I wants to be with ya, love with ya, stay with ya,
sleep with ya all of my life
