(Can you keep a secret?)
(You're gonna like this. Check it)
Waking up on the bright side of the bed
With you
Made 2 am love that neither one of us regret
Oooo
In a couple hours we'll go separate way
Not telling anybody that we're on the same page
We got everybody thinking that we're just friends
But what they don't know is that you and me go crazy on a Monday morning
Laying it low, keeping it quiet don't want anyone knowing
You leave with me, sleep with me
Can't get you out of my head
Got that undercover love
in and out of the bed
Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh
Stop (Don't stop) let me catch my breath
Just looking at you makes me wanna release some stress
Honestly I bet we might've skipped a few steps
Right into ripping the sheets off instead
We got everybody thinking that we're just friends
But what they don't know is that you and me go crazy on a Monday morning
Laying it low, keeping it quiet don't want anyone knowing
You leave with me, sleep with me
Can't get you out of my head
Got that undercover love
In and out of the bed
Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh
They know that we're always talking, they know that you're making me laugh
They know that there must be something happening behind their backs
They know that we ain't always social, but we know how to have a good time
They know that they might need help reading between the lines
But what they don't know is that you and me go crazy on a Monday morning
Laying it low, keeping it quiet don't want anyone knowing
You leave with me, sleep with me
Can't get you out of my head
Got that undercover love
In and out of the bed
Oh Oh Oh
Oh Undercover
(Yeah I kinda liked it)
