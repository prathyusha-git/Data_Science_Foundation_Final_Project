Sippin' at the wine
Drinkin' all the time
Drinkin' kinda slow
Hopin' it won't go
See when I get dry
I just sit and cry over my baby
Seems that in the past
It was gonna last
Somewhere it went wrong
All the good time's gone
But I don't know why
So I sit and cry over my baby
Well, now yeah, I thought that, I thought that
If we could take it, we'd love each other so much
We'd be sure to make it, but oh baby, oh my baby
Look what we've got, there's nothin' at all
Thinkin' of the bad times
Stretched out on my bed
Images of you, girl
Runnin' through my head
Wish that I could die
So I lay and cry over my baby

It's nothin' at all, yes, look what we've got
