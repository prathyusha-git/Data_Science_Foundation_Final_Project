I lost my mind
Walked the same street a thousand times
Held hands and closed my eyes
But I was left behind
And I could cry
If I see that face again
And I walk that pace again
Now I feel the same again
And I, I
I lost my mind
Yeah, I, I
I lost my mind
So where was I?
Think I wrote down a little note
Swear I met some funny blokes
But I can't find what I wrote
And I did cry
Caught a glimpse of my own eye
That's the reason that I know why
But the tears were already dry
And I, I
I lost my mind
Yeah, I, I
I lost my mind
♪
I lost my mind
Yeah, I, I
I lost my mind
