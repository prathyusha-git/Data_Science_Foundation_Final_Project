She comes up like a rose
And everybody knows
She'll get you in dutch
Well, you can look, but you'd better not touch
Poison ivy
Poison ivy
Well, late at night, when you're sleepin'
Poison ivy comes a creepin' all around
She's pretty as a daisy
But look out, man, she's crazy
She'll really do you in
If you let her get under your skin
Poison ivy
Poison ivy
Well, late at night, when you're sleepin'
Poison ivy comes a creepin' all around
Measles make you mumpy
Mumps'll make you lumpy
Chicken pox will make you jump and twitch
Common cold'll cool you
Whooping cough will fool you
But poison ivy, Lord, will make you itch
You're gonna need an ocean
Of Calamine lotion
You'll be scratching like a hound
The minute you start to mess around
Poison ivy
Poison ivy
Well, late at night, when you're sleepin'
Poison ivy comes a creepin' all around
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
