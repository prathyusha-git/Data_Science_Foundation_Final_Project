Just like a top the world goes spinning round
Nobody knows what's going on I've found
Even from Jerusalem to old Japan
Nobody seems to have a definite, definite plan
Must be a peaceful way for us to go
Even the simplest of man must know
The situation's getting worse and worse
One day the bubble's gonna burst
But don't be frightened lady
We will never let them take your boy to war
No don't be frightened lady
We will never ever go to war no more
Why don't they finish it all
We are only people and we're terribly small
Why don't they finish it all
Do they think that people don't mean nothing, nothing at all
Students are marching now in every land
They won't be shifted just like grains of sand
If we don't get together pretty soon
We'll do the same thing on the moon
