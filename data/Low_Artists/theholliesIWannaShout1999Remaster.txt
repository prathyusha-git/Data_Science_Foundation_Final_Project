Do you find it hard to tell me
To tell me that you really love me
'Cos I find it hard to tell you
To tell you that I really love you
And I know what's in your heart
In your mind, in your body and your soul
But it's easy when we whisper
Not letting people know
We wanna shout it out loud
But we can't let people know
We wanna shout it out loud
But our love is not to show
We wanna shout it out loud
But we can't let people know
We wanna shout it out loud
But our love is not to show
I've got something you've got nothing
A child, a home of my own
It's so hard for me to break it
I can't break it, I can't make it on my own
We wanna shout it out loud
But we can't let people know
We wanna shout it out loud
But our love is not to show
We wanna shout it out loud
But we can't let people know
We wanna shout it out loud
But our love is not to show
We wanna shout it out loud
But we can't let people know
