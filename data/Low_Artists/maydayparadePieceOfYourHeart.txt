Give me your misery, all of it, give it to me
I can hold onto it for you, it's not a problem
Just want your energy, a piece of that fractured mountain
I'll take whatever comes with it as long as it's yours
And all I know is that I want it more than yesterday
If I was waiting, I was waiting for just one little spark
You are the brightest I've seen
You are the best side of me
And just for when we're apart
I've got a piece of your heart (ohh, oh-oh oh)
But I want the whole damn thing
I feel it inside of me, I feel it inside of you too
Seeing forever, this downcast blade from the sky
Could never sever through, not what we have, me and you
Burning together and burning forever
And I don't know, I just can feel it in the atmosphere
If I'm wandering, I've wandered into just the right spot
You are the fire in my sleep
You are the reason that I dream
And just for when we're apart
I've got a piece of your heart (ohh, oh-oh oh)
I've got a piece of your heart (ohh, oh-oh oh)
But I want the whole damn thing
Say hello to all my problems for me
Tell them sorry, I can't be around anymore
The years will go on, we'll get older and then we'll die
But we'll get by
Oh, and it goes on forever just like this
If I could go back I'd do it all over
With you again (ohh, oh-oh oh)
I've got a piece of your heart (ohh, oh-oh oh)
But I want the whole damn thing
Say hello to all my problems for me
Tell them sorry, I can't be around anymore
Years will go on, we'll get older and then we'll die
But we'll get by
