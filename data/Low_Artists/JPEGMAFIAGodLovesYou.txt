Lift me up, turn me around now
Turn me around, lift my feet, yeah
Lift my feet, off solid ground
Off solid ground, lift my feet, yeah (d-damn Peggy, what? Hahahaha)
Lift my feet, off solid ground
Turn me around, lift my feet, yeah
Feet, off solid ground
Off solid ground
Check
That pussy on my face, I'ma talk in tongues
Legs in the air, scream hallelujah
Make her squirt that Holy Water
Drinkin' down wine but no communion
Only my dick she is consumin'
On her knees, said, "Oh my God"
Pull the camera out, let's make a movie
Pussy wet like Noah's Ark
Go'n ahead, girl, just bless me
If you on your period, call me Moses
'Cause I'm about to split that Red Sea
Gimme that head like you're breakin' bread
I'm about to fuck you like the Twelve Disciples
Hold my balls, lick it 'til we get across
Flex on your back but I know ya like that
Her with my dick like David and Goliath
Take your thong off, flick it at me like a slingshot
Might give her cock on a mountaintop
Drop, drop, then again, it don't stop
We like Adam and Eve, but I'ma eat that apple bottom
Snake in the grass, go'n shake that ass
Like Keith Sweat, I'ma make it last
Wanna eat that pussy, I broke my fast, hahahaha
Uh
Now how many times I gotta tell you, when I get to that money, better shake that ass? (Great)
How many times I gotta tell you, when I get to that money they come back fast
Now how many times I gotta tell you, when I get to that money, better shake that shit?
Now how many times, when I lace you with how many rhymes?
When I tell you it's somethin' that deep, and you come back and tell me it's fine?
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
How many times I gotta tell you, when I get to that money, better shake that ass?
Water that pussy like baptist
To find my sauce, need an at-
Lift me up, turn me around now
Turn me around, lift my feet, yeah
Lift my feet, off solid ground
Off solid ground, lift my feet, yeah
Lift my feet, off solid ground
Turn me around, lift my feet, yeah
Lift my feet, off solid ground
Off solid ground
