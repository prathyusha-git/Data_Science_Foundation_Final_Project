First I was beggin' you to call me up (Call me up)
I'm beggin' you to stop, you call too much
What the fuck?
You tried to play me but I balled you up (Balled you up)
Weak defence, knew it was not enough
Know I be trippin', almost fallin' in love
Ignorin' the signs, calling it love
All the above
Thought it was different but it's only because
You caught me slippin'
I'm the one trippin' 'cause
I gave you a little, now you askin' for too much
Let you hit it once and now you askin' for two glugs
Wait for you to call me, I ain't heard from you for two months
I didn't move on, I only move up
Uh-uh, uh, oh-oh, oh
Damn, what you want from me? You askin' for too much
You're too much
You're too much
You're too much
You're too much (Yeah, yeah)
You're too much
Tell me you love me, you want me bad baby
If I just pull up, you call me mad crazy
Too hard to reach 'cause you in your bag lately
Spendin' my time wit' you only on my mind, on a regular
And I can't decide if it's regular
You tell me I need to chill with the bullshit
Gimme a minute for you to listen, oh
I gave you a little, now you askin' for too much (Pick it up right now)
Let you hit it once and now you askin' for two glugs
Wait for you to call me, I ain't heard from you in two months (Ay)
I didn't move on (Be there beside you), I only move up, uh-uh
(You the one crazy, been tryna phase me, I blame your love)
Uh, oh-oh, oh
Damn, what you want from me? (I'm at the gate, tellin' me to wait)
You askin' for too much (Fuck out my face, used to move like)
You're too much (Roll like I'm wasted)
You're too much (Don't want it 'cause you got it)
You're too much (You keep me hangin' on it)
You're too much (Together we exotic)
You're too much (You know that shit, don't front, nigga)
Thing is wit' you, I bought the coupe
Pull up and shoot, callin' a truce
You know the rules break just like that
When it's real then you come right back
