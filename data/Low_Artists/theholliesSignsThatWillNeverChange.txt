Leaves come falling on a winter's day
Robins weep and watch them sail away
Floating on the water is autumns last farewell
These are signs that will never change
Signs that will never change
Rivers once were frozen now they're free
Showing winter's going rapidly
Tadpoles turning into frogs in winter's last farewell
These are signs that will never change
Signs that will never change
The changing faces of the seasons
Are those that cannot be compared
Except in love it sometimes happens
Love grows but all too soon it dies
Tadpoles turning into frogs in winter's last farewell
These are signs that will never change
Signs that will never change
Signs that will never change
