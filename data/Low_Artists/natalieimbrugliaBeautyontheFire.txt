Here it comes again
Cannot outrun my desire
Cover my descent
And throw the beauty on the fire
Drawn towards the edge
Do I assume I could fly?
Every secret shared
Why do I drink the feelings dry?
Don't go too far limitation scars
Tonight, could I be lost forever
To drown my soul in sensory pleasure?
Here it comes again
You raise the bar even higher
I cannot catch my breath
So throw the beauty on the fire
Don't push too hard limitation scars
Tonight, could I be lost forever
To drown my soul in sensory pleasure?
Sensory pleasure
Sensory pleasure
Sensory pleasure
Could I be lost forever?
Do I assume I could fly?
Tonight, could I be lost forever
To drown my soul in sensory pleasure?
Sensory pleasure
Sensory pleasure
Sensory pleasure
Could I be lost forever?
