I think of the mornings
We lied there talking
And we sat for hours
And it never got boring
You told me you loved me
While drinking your coffee
And I could've sworn
You really did want me
Then we're in the club and you're kissing her neck
I'm stood by myself, texting my friends
'Cause I, I, I
Hate to see you with someone else (with someone else)
Then I'm getting a drink while you're falling in love
And you dance with her like you did with us
And I, I, I
Hate to see you with someone else (with someone else)
I wish that I was someone else, ah
I wish that I was someone else, ah
I think of the evening
And wine on the weekend
I hate to admit
That I was so in the deep end
And we split a taxi
Hold hands on the backseat
Yeah, I could've sworn
You really did want me
Then we're in the club and you're kissing her neck
I'm stood by myself, texting my friends
'Cause I, I, I
Hate to see you with someone else (with someone else)
Then I'm getting a drink while you're falling in love
And you dance with her like you did with us
And I, I, I
Hate to see you with someone else (with someone else)
I wish that I was someone else, ah
I wish that I was someone else, ah, ah
So tell me, baby, why not me?
Was I just a novelty?
Why'd you choose her over me?
Tell me, baby, why not me?
Did you love me, honestly?
God, I hate that you're happy
Then we're in the club and you're kissing her neck
I'm stood by myself, texting my friends
'Cause I, I, I
Hate to see you with someone else (with someone else)
Then, I'm getting a drink while you're falling in love
And you dance with her like you did with us
And I, I, I
Hate to see you with someone else (with someone else)
I wish that I was someone else
I wish that I was someone else
I wish that I was someone else
