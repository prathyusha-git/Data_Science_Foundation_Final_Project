And his love will be his vision
He'll take you where you stand
Will you stand your life by his
And help the boy become a man?
He'd be the son of his father
His father the teacher
Teaching love and honesty
Being his own man handler
For the son of the son of the run of the mill run
Rotten gambler
Will the devil be getting to you,
As you look back, over what you've done?
What you've done
Was it for reason or for rhyme?
Was it just for fun?
He'd be the son of his father
His father the teacher
Teaching love and honesty
Being his own man handler
For the son of the son of the run of the mill run
Rotten gambler
Back on the road, now
You can lose your head
There ain't no kingdom for the gambling man
You know the road, now
And you made your stand
When his eyes shine upon you,
Shine upon you
And he'd be the son of his father
His father the teacher
Teaching love and honesty
Being his own man handler
For the son of the son of the run of the mill run
Rotten gambler
He'd be the son of his father
His father the teacher
Teaching love and honesty
Being his own man handler
For the son of the son of the run of the mill run
Rotten gambler
He'd be the son of his father,
His father the teacher
Teaching love and honesty
Being his own man handler
For the son of the son of the run of the mill run
Rotten gambler
