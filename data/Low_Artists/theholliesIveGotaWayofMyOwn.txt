Everything 'round them is spinning and turning
But they can't understand
People around me just never stop learning
'Bout the things that are planned
I got a way, way of my own
Just look around them, they'd better start thinking
People will lend a hand
They'd better watch it or else they'll start sinking
With their heads in the sand
I got a way, way of my own
Come back when your time's full, woo
You must think you don't need anyone, no, no
Come back when your time's full, woo
They might find what they're looking for
They might find what they're looking for
I can't believe that the reason they're giving
Will entice me to go
Why they deny me the right to start living
I'll just never know
I got a way, way of my own
Come back when your time's full, woo
They must think they don't need anyone, no, no
Come back when your time's full, woo
They might find what they're looking for
They might find what they're looking for
They might find what they're looking for
They might find what they're looking for
They might find what they're looking for
They might find what they're looking for
