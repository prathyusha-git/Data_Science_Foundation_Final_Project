Where where is the promised land
Where where is the promised land
It can't be found in Viet Nam
It can't be where the eagle has landed
If we want peace for every man
We've gotta make the world demand it
♪
Now I see the flag is flying
We've got to help them stop the dying
We must bring back the soldier boys
We mustn't let them die for nothing
War's a better game when played with toys
Let's change the game and let's start loving
♪
Soldiers never fight alone
There's just as much fighting going on at home
Protests, violence, marches
It's all going on at home
Bring them all back home (repeat)
