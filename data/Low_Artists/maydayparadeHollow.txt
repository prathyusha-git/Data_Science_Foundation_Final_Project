She's a cold blooded killer
Go and find who sent her
Bring me the heart and leave the rest for dead
Seven saints and sinners
And only God forgives her
Hollow, hollow, hollow
The truth you swallow, swallow
♪
I am the cancer
Try and find the center
Take care your lance and cut away, (cut away, let's run away)
So what if I don't wanna leave
Could you take it?
Would you make it?
She's a cold blooded killer
Go and find who sent her
Bring me her heart and leave the rest for dead
Hollow, hollow, hollow
The truth you swallow, swallow
Bring me the head and cast the rest away

Hollow, hollow, hollow, the truth you swallow, swallow
Hollow, hollow, hollow, the truth you swallow
She's a cold blooded killer (hollow, hollow)
Go and find who sent her (swallow, swallow)
Bring me the heart, and leave the rest for dead
Hollow, hollow, hollow, the truth you swallow
Bring me the head and cast the rest away
