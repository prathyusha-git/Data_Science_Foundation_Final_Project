Victimhood
I heed a call to step out of victimhood
Has a saintly glow, holier than thou
It erased my shadow, shadow
Only bird's eye-view
Can help me transcend this archetype
Who am I?
That this has happened to?
Thought the world owed me love
Only bird's eye-view
Can help me transgress
Out of this hole
To transgress us, beyond our tragedy
I took one for the team
I sacrificed to save us (to save us)
I sacrificed myself (I rejected myself) To save us
(Sacrificed myself)
I sacrificed myself
Felt sorry for myself
To transgress us
I sacrificed myself (transgress us)
Took one for the team
Victimhood, I heed a call out of
Victimhood, ooh, I heed a call out of
Victimhood, ooh
Here I go now
