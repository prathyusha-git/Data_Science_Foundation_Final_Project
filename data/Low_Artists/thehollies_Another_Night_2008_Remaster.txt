Out on the town
Kicking around feeling bluesy
It's getting late
I can't afford to be choosy
Should be home and dry by now
Tried every trick in the book, but
Another night
Saturday night and I'm losing
Another night
Saturday night and I'm losing
The DJ plays a song from the past I remember
I hold her tight in my arms, she surrenders
It's the same old record playing
But it's a different girl that's swaying
Another night
Saturday night and I'm losing
Another night
Saturday night and I'm losing
As we move "round the room
Whispering things with my eyes closed
It feels that you're here
Then the music stops
I open my eyes
My fantasy ends
We're not even friends
So leave me to
Catch my ride
Pay my fare on my way home
The same thing
Every week on my own
Next time around
You might be there
My luck might change
But until then
Another night
Saturday night and I'm losing
Another night
Saturday night and I'm losing
Another night
Saturday night and I'm losing
Another night
Saturday night and I'm losing
