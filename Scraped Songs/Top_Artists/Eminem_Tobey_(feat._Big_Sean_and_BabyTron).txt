Shit, fuck, shit
Boy, ha
Tobey Maguire got bit by a spider, but see, me, it was a goat
If you want space, I hope you take your helmet off soon as you get up to Venus and choke
Even while sleepin', be thinkin' so woke
White Cartiers, all I'm seein' is dope
My city Leia and I'm Obi-Wan, got a mission to pass, I just might be the hope

No Español, I'm allergic to rojo and legally blind, all I'm seein' is go
D to the A, there and back, if we ride with the Drac', can't smoke from the T to the O
Upped in the bitch, you can keep what you owe
Granny told me, "Boy, you reap what you sow"
Do the most, we over-even the score
Said he on the run, glued his feet to the floor
Up in my Tesla, I'm rollin' up 'Ishers, I stopped at Valero, think I should quit smokin'
Life is a gamble, and I'm playin' slots, pull it down, close my eyes and I pray I win tokens
All Wock', no pop, how we drive, you can come and take a baby sip, still taste that it's potent
One of one, sittin' 'round the stars, double R, finna race, hit the Wraith, like a spaceship it's floatin'
All this drip, think I am below sea level
Cut your own wrist off with that weak bezel
Ride around with the Iron Giant, make 'em eat metal
Watch unc' break a rock down to three pebbles
Bam-bam, down three, hit the grand slam
Four pockets full, fully switched, go wham-wham
Pants cramp, pull it out, I'm countin' 'til my hands cramp
Wrote "DSM" on the beach, now the sand stamped
Boy
Ay, ay
They wanna bleed me and lead me to act like they need me, but fuck it, I do it alone (whoa)
She wanna touch me and rub me, and go back to hubby
He probably could smell my cologne (damn)
I was immersed in the Murcié, I show 'em no mercy, I really was watchin' the throne (for real)
Niggas ain't turnin' me down, when my baby asleep only time that I'm watchin' my tone, look (shh)
We don't want chips with a chip on our shoulder
If he Obi-Wan, then I gotta be Yoda
Don't need no promoter, we pull up, they know us
I'm the Ayatollah snatching your controller
I don't give a fuck about you when I'm focused
Fuck all the drugs you take, I'm takin' over
I paid attention, don't need no payola
Can't take 'way from me, you just need to take cover (frr)
I can paint a picture like I made the stencil
Fuck your whole image, I'm with Cole Bennett
I don't know what the fuck they done told niggas
I put all of my heart and my soul in it
I met you in person, you so different
I can't listen to you for a whole minute
Took a blood test, ain't no ho in it
Watch your motherfuckin' mouth 'fore I go in it
They like, "No, he didn't," got 'em more invested
If it's one thing I make, I make no exceptions
I got new addresses, I got no reception
I got love and hate comin' from both directions
Bitch, I come from the D where they BMFing
Where they movin' them keys like a chord progression
Bitch, I'm omnipresent, I got no reflection
Made a livin' off bars, I need no correction (no)
Grindin' shit out, gotta stay patient
While you outside, we on staycation
Locked the fuck in, ain't no playin' for real 'less you playmakin'
I take the chances you hate takin'
Fuck it, dog, I'ma go Wes Craven
I'm at the safe, fuck a safe haven
They play with my name and I can't take it (lil' bitch)

White Cartiers, all I'm seein' is dope (yeah)
My city Leia and I'm Obi-Wan, got a mission to pass, I just might be the hope
Tobey Maguire got bit by a spider, me? Must've got bit by a goat (yeah)
I used to dream as a kid I would grow (baa) to be one, I hope that I inspire hope (for what?)
For you to go get what you desire most (yeah)
Spit fire, bitch, I was just flyin' coach (yeah)
Y'all thought you were sick, you were misdiagnosed (nope)
I'm dope and you'll never have this high a dose (nope, yeah)
Now my estates in the buildin'
And bitch, I done slept on more floors than the Empire State ('pire State) Building
I got so many stories, but I hate ceilings (haha)
Ain't feelin' your top five favorite rappers (whoo)
So I know they 'bout to be pissed at me (why?)
But this, to me, is a mystery
How rappers I've already ripped could be (what?)
Higher up on a list than me (ha)
Yet here I sit on your list though at five (hm), which still is fine
But just know inside, to me, that shit's hilarious, so when I (haha)
Get dissed though and by a pioneer
Who was one of the reasons why I am here
They tell me I should just let that shit go and slide (why?)
"Melle Mel shouldn't get no reply" (why?)
"That man is a legend," bitch, so am I (haha, yeah)
And anyone else who thinks it'd be wise and easy as pie
To beat me and tries, can treat me just like poison (what?)
They can eat me and die (hehe)
Middle finger stuck up, but I never conceded
When have I ever retreated? (Never), you never seen it
Every dream that I ever dreamt, I exceeded
Cement my legacy, I definitely did controversy, I always fed on, I need it
Treat it like a truck, hit it head-on, I meet it (krrk)
I get on a beat, and it's like that "Eye of the Tiger" song is playin' on my head on repeat
I been knocked down so many times, can't count (ugh)
Sometimes, shit does not pan out
That's just the way that the card hand's dealt
Jon Manziel, odd man out (what?)
But heavyweight, word to Scott Van Pelt
I can't help but feel like a victim of child abuse
'Cause I am 'bout to get that goddamn belt (now strap, man)
Way beyond crazy, Shady gone, but hey, maybe, I'm the GOAT
That bit Sean and BabyTron, and that's why they be on the shit they be on, 'cause (ugh)
