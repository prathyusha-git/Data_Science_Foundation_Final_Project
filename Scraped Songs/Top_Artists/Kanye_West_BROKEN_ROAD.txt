Baby, I'm free, baby, I'm free, like a homeless person
No matter how much you got, you can't own this person
Sometimes, I feel like the only honest person
When somebody snatch your soul, and karate didn't work
When you 'bout to lose all hope, the sun rose and opened roads
What if the surgeon really the serpent?
I paid for BBLs and Birkins
That wasn't me, that was Tyler Durden
I ain't gon' lie, I get tired of splurgin'
Love isn't perfect, love is a version of bein' a virgin again
I was told it's how you interpreted it (what does it mean to find your soul?)
