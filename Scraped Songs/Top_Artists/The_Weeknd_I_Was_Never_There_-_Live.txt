What makes a grown man wanna cry?
(Cry, cry, cry, cry)
What makes him wanna take his life?
(Ah, ah)
His happiness is never real
(Real, real, real, real)
And mindless sex is how he feels, ooh, he heals
When it's time, when it's time, when it's time
It won't matter (it don't matter)
It won't matter (matter)
When it's time, when it's time, when it's time (time, it's time, babe)
It won't matter (it won't matter, babe)
It won't matter (ya)
It was like he was never there
(It was like he was never there)
It was like he was gone in thin air, oh
When it's time, when it's time, when it's time, oh, baby
It won't matter (It won't matter, baby)
It won't matter
