I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
Been wanting my cake and eat it too, and wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Ooh, hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get was bittersweet
It was like winning a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginning to lose sleep, one sheep, two sheep
Going cuckoo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath

Now I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it
'Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjuring
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
(Yeah, ponderin' will do you wonders)
(No wonder you're losing your mind, the way it wanders)
Yodel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist to intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love is killing me and I can't conquer it
My OCD is conking me in the head
Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking
I'm just relaying what the voice of my head saying
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed

Call me crazy, but I had this vision
One day that I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then drums get killed and I'm coming straight at MCs
Blood gets spilled and I take it back to the days that I get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played 'em
I ain't here to save the fucking children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle, feels and relates, that's great!
It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back in the draft
Turn nothing into something, still can make that
Straw in the gold, chump, I will spin
Rumpelstiltskin in a hay stack
Maybe I need a straightjacket
Face facts, I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothing, I'm still friends with the
