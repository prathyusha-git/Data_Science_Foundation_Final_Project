My soul
What if I start off the track, hum the beginnin'
Fucked up the middle part, and mumble the endin'?
It just feels better, in my humble opinion
Much more n-words, but humble beginnings
When I act like the n-word, somebody get injured
That's why we stay in court and go to the pen' for it
Before I forget, let me go get a pen for it
Cancel culture, before I get censored
All I really meant for is you to get mentored
Before we get sentenced, before we get sent for
Remember this sentence, remember repentance
Only God can judge me, GDs and Vice Lords
Over in Danville, Stateville, Taylorville, Menard
Jacksonville, Pontiac, Pinckneyville
We mass targeted, mass marketed
Mass incarceration, mass in police stations
Mass incorporated, fuck Adidas (my soul)
Won't be gettin' sleep tonight, and I'm cryin' as I write this
Prayin' for my brother, locked up, fightin' fires
And my heart goes out to all the daughters missing God and fathers
Never see they loved ones 'cause they're prisoners, fightin' fires
(My soul) oh
And I might be biased, but I feel God standin' by us
And the prisoners fightin' fires, oh, yeah (my soul)
And I might be biased, but my soul needs you, Lord
Oh, God, please, come take control (take control of my soul)
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, I know, I know
Ah-ah, oh, no, no, no, no, no
The struggle is real, gotta face it
My freedom so close, I can taste it
Make money, got bills, so I chase it
But stay on my Deen, 'cause without it, I'm faithless
They promise they with you, they lies
They just want what you got and they try
All alone with nobody beside
You sit there and cry, just wishin' you die
Know this life is a test, tryna pass it
With my face on the ground in the Masjid
You got questions, so you better ask 'em
'Cause time wait for no one, it comes and it passes
Under pressure, attack on me daily
Love my mama, she tried, couldn't save me
Gave me tools to survive through this crazy
"Fear nothing but God, and be good to your lady"
Wait on tears and no one understand
It's predestined and God got a plan
One thing I know, he made me a man
He gave me two legs on the ground on to stand
To my wifey, baby, you so fine
Proud to say to the world, "Yeah, you mine"
You stood by me through all the hard times
You pushed the line, you pushed the line
I, I can feel you light up on me
Keep shinin' your light up on me
Shine your light, just shine up on me
I can feel your light, oh
