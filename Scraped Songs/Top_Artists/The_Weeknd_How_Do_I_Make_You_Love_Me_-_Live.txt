We're goin' back in time
I'd like to see you try
Unpackin' thoughts through tunnels in your mind
I'll fix you mushroom tea
And cross the restless sea
Release yourself to escape reality
It doesn't faze you
I need a breakthrough
I only want what's right in front of me
It's quite unusual
Seekin' approval
Beggin' for it desperately
I said
Los Angeles, welcome to the After Hours til Dawn Tour
I'ma feel out what side is more crazier tonight
Is it the left side or the right side?
Let's find out
Left side, left side, left side, left side, left side, left side, left side, left side
Right side, right side, right side, right side, one, two, one, two, three
Let's go
(How do I make you love me?)
How do I make you fall for me?
How do I make you want me
And make it last eternally?
How do I make you love me?
How do I make you fall for me?
How do I make you want me
And make it last eternally?
I can see the real you, girl
You don't have to hide
Forget 'bout what your daddy said
I'll teach you how to shine
And all the things you tolerated
Made you cold inside
But I can light you up again
Like embers of a fire
It doesn't faze you
I need a breakthrough
I only want what's right in front of me
It's quite unusual
Seekin' approval
Beggin' for it desperately
I said
(How do I make you love me?)
One, two, three, come on
(How do I make you fall for me?) Shit
How do I make you want me
And make it last eternally?
How do I make you love me?
How do I make you fall for me?
How do I make you want me
And make it last eternally?

Said I love you, Los Angeles
Yes, I do, oh, oh
Come on
