This is the life I live
And that's just the half of it
Saw me on the television
Hangin' out my dirty linen
You're entitled to your own opinion
Sit and shake your head at my decision
I guess the kind of songs that I've been singing
Make it seem as if I'm always winnin'

I'm the life of the party
Beautiful people surround me
Everybody falling in love

Sticks and stones they never break me
