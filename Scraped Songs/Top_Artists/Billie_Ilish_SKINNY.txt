Hm (I never did you wrong)
Hm (and my, my patience is gone)
Fell in love for the first time
With a friend, it's a good sign
Feeling off when I feel fine
21 took a lifetime
People say I look happy
Just because I got skinny
But the old me is still me and maybe the real me
And I think she's pretty
♪
And I still cry
♪
Cry
♪
And you know why
Am I acting my age now?
Am I already on the way out?
When I step off the stage, I'm a bird in a cage
I'm a dog in a dog pound
And you said I was your secret
And you didn't get to keep it
And the internet is hungry for the meanest kind of funny
And somebody's gotta feed it
Oh, do you still cry?
Still cry
I cry
I never did you wrong (never did you wrong)
And my (my), my patience is gone (is gone)
And I (I), I never did you wrong (you wrong)
I loved you for so long, hm
