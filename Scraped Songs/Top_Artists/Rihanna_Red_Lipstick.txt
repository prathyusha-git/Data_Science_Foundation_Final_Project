Red lipstick, all on the paper
Let me take a hit while you sit and watch
Go 'head, talk shit, it's all in the papers
Let me grab my dick while you sit on top (no)
Do you right here, while the whole world's watchin' (no)
All up in my mental, gotta get up in my physical
Don't know what you did, but you really got me feeling that feeling tonight
All on you, babe, 'cause you really got me feeling that feeling tonight
I want you, babe, got me going cray, hard to let it blow, let it go
Just show me where you want me, baby
Can't fight the feeling, 'cause you really got me feeling that feeling tonight
Can't fight the feeling, can't, can't, can't fight the feeling, yeah, yeah (what I like, can't lie, oh)
I just can't fight the feeling, can't, can't, can't fight the feeling, yeah, yeah (do whatever you like, oh)
I just can't fight the feeling, can't, can't, can't fight the feeling, yeah, yeah (you got my love tonight, oh)
Can't fight the feeling, can't, can't, can't fight the feeling, yeah, yeah
