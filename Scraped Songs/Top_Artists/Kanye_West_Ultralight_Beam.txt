I'm tryna keep my faith
But I'm looking for more
Somewhere I can feel safe
And end my holy war
I'm tryna keep my faith
So why send oppression, not blessings?
Why, oh, why'd You do me wrong? (More)
You persecute the weak
Because it makes You feel so strong (safe)
Don't have much strength to fight
So I look to the light (war)
To make these wrongs turn right
Head up high, I look to the light
Yeah, 'cause I know that You'll make everything alright
And I know that You'll take good care of Your child
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
'Cause I, I look to the light
When they come for You, I will shield Your name
I will field their questions, I will feel Your pain
No one can judge, they don't
They don't know, they don't know
Foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted, Pangaea
I'm moving all my family from Chatham to Zambia
Treat the demons just like Pam
I mean, I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina
I been this way since Arthur was anteater
Now they wanna hit me with the whoo, wap, the bam
Tryna snap photos of familia
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
I made "Sunday Candy," I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said, "Let's do a good ass job with Chance 3"
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'ma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride, I'ma still give 'em raincoats
Know what God said when He made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it, you know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head 'cause I bet
That my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, 'cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light, look at lil' Chano from 79th
We on an ultralight beam, we on an ultralight beam

Father, this prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough
This prayer's for everybody that feel that they're too messed up
For everyone that feels they've said, "I'm sorry" too many times
You can never go too far when you can't come back home again
That's why I need
Faith
More
Safe
War
