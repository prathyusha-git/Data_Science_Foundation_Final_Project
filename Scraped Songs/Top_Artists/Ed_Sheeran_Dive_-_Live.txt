I'm expecting big things
When the chorus comes in on this song
You gonna sing it loud
You gonna scream it
Maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh, just a little bit wrong
Baby, I apologize for it
I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
I could live, I could die
Hangin' on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And jumpin' in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake
Scream it out!
So don't call me "baby"
Oh, unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
You're a mystery
I have travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you, no one
What's your history?
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'Cause I heard you do, mm
Or I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
I could live, I could die
Hangin' on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
Lie awake every day
Don't know how much I can take
Don't call me "baby"
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
I could live, I could die
Hangin' on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
Sittin' back, lookin' at
Every mess that I made
Don't call me ("baby")
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
And before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you
Thanks all for the band
