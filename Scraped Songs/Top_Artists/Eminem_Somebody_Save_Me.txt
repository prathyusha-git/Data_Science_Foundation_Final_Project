Daddy? (Huh?)
Food's here (kept buyin' it when she gets it)
Come eat (Alaina, I'm so tired)
Just come eat (Alaina, I'll be there in a minute, I promise, stop)
Well then wake up (shut that door)
Somebody save me, me from myself
I've spent so long livin' in hell
Another pill as I start to spiral
Message to my daughters
I don't even deserve the father title
Hailie, I'm so sorry
I know I wasn't there for your first guitar recital
Didn't walk you down the aisle
Missed the birth of your first child
Your first podcast, lookin' down, sweetie
I'm so proud of how you turned out
Sorry that I chose drugs and put 'em above you
Sorry that I didn't love you enough to
Give 'em up, how the fuck do I not love you
More than a pill? Lookin' up to the ceilin'
From this floor, wonder will
Somebody save me, me from myself
I've spent so long livin' in hell
They say my lifestyle is bad for my health
It's the only thing that seems to help
Alaina, sorry that you had to hear me fall in the bathroom
Sorry that I missed you gradu- wait, Nate, I should just congratulate you
On being a dad to Carter and Liam, look at you
Little bro, sorry I left you, sorry that I'll never get to
Hold or hug my little nephews, Stevie, I'm sorry, I missed you
Grow up, and I didn't get to be the dad I wanted to be to you
Things I wanted to see you do, this is my song from me to you
Sorry, I gave up but I'm just so defeated
God, what the fuck do you want me to do?
Somebody save me, me from myself
I've spent so long livin' in hell
They say my lifestyle is bad for my health
It's the only thing that seems to help
I've been starin' at that video of Hailie
Almost daily of her playin' a guitar
In hopes maybe that'd give me the power to fight
But the addict in me's a coward
He told me that I can't do it, had a second chance, blew it
It's like I'm stuck inside an alternate reality, but I know (what?)
I'll turn it around and be able to
Walk her and Lainie one day
To the altar as proud as can be
Right now, I'm just weak
As I fall further down in this deep hole
And farther in the ground that I sink
As they lower me in my coffin
I feel the tears all fallin' down on my cheek
I'm a lost cause, baby, don't waste your time on me
I'm so damaged beyond repair, life has shattered my hopes and my dreams
I'm a lost cause, baby, don't waste your time on me
I'm so damaged beyond repair, life has shattered my hopes and my dream
