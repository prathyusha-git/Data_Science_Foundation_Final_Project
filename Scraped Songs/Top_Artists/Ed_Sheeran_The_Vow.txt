When we met, we were scared, we were lost, we were young
On the edge, on the brink, on the run
But the moment my eyes met your gaze
It's like a door opened up on that day
Then we talked, then we danced, then we touched
Then we laughed, then we kissed, then we stopped
'Cause I knew if I kissed you again
We would start something that never ends
I promised you all of my days
I'll swear it again and again
Words are just words, but I need you to know
That beyond to have and hold
That my vow to you is to love you and never let go
We've been through hurt, but I thank the broken road
That led me into your arms
And my vow to you is to love you and never let go
Now we're here (now we're here)
Now we've lived, now we've cried, now we've seen (now we've seen)
All the lows, all the highs, in-between (in-between)
I was there on your darkest of nights
And you were there for mine, right by my side
We made breath, we made blood, we made life
We lost friends and faith, we lost sight
And when all of these moments have come
We have walked through the fire as one
We're stronger from joy and from pain
Our love is the thing that remains
Words are just words, but I need you to know
That beyond to have and hold
That my vow to you is to love you and never let go
We've been through hurt, but I thank the broken road
That led me into your arms
And my vow to you is to love you and never let go
Hey, it doesn't matter
If we make a mess of it, we'll get through anything, yeah
Hey, now and forever
I want the rest of it, I want the rest of it
Words are just words, but I need you to know
That beyond to have and hold
That my vow to you is to love you and never let go
We've been through hurt, but I thank the broken road (broken road)
That led me into your arms (in those arms)
And my vow to you is to love you and never let go
Mm, oh
