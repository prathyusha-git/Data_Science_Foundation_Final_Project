(Look what you've done)
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, we just getting started Los Angeles, c'mon (I'm a motherfuckin' starboy)
(Look what you've done)
(I'm a motherfuckin' starboy)
I'm tryna put you in the worst mood, ah
P1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah
Milli point two just to hurt you, ah
All red Lamb' just to tease you, ah
None of these toys on lease too, ah
Made your whole year in a week too, yah
Main bitch outta your league too, ah
Side bitch outta your-, let's go
House so empty, need a centerpiece
20 racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby
You talkin' money, need a hearin' aid
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha) I see, I see
Look what you've done
Why? 'Cause I'm a motherfuckin' (Starboy)
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
(Look what you've done) look what you've done, ooh, baby
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Every day, a nigga try to test me, ah
Every day, a nigga try to end me, yah
Pull off in that Roadster SV
Pockets overweight, gettin' hefty, ah
Comin' for the king, that's a far cry, I
I come alive in the fall time, I
No competition, I don't really listen
I'm in the blue Mulsanne, bumpin' New
House so empty, need a centerpiece
20 racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby
You talkin' money, need a hearin' aid
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, say
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Look what you've done, ooh, oh, oh (ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Say, 'cause I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Look what you've done
Los Angeles, look what you motherfuckin' done
(I'm a motherfuckin' starboy)
Let a nigga brag Pitt
Legend of the fall, took the year like a bandit
Bought Mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop lookin' lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
A hundred on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars
House so empty, need a centerpiece
20 racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby
You talkin' money, need a hearin' aid
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, so let's
