Some days, the sun holds you closer than I do
And the wind wraps around you like my arms want to
If the rain consoles the tears you cry
I wish I was a little piece of that peace you find
And I'll try my best to hold you through the phone
Through your mountain high highs and valley lows
And when winter comes, some birds fly south
I've never been that type, and I'm not right now
I'm forever, I'm for always
From your first breath till my last day
Whether I'm by your side
Or a thousand miles away
I'm forever, I'm for always
Sometimes the stars will guide you better than I can
And you'll close your eyes, holdin' another's hand
Your skin, your hair, your world will change
You will trust someone, your heart will break
I will be the constant that remains
I'm forever (I'm forever), I'm for always (I'm for always)
From your first breath (Your first breath) till my last day
Whether I'm by your side
Or a thousand miles away
I'm forever, I'm for always
I'm forever, I'm for always
From your first breath till my last day
Whether I'm by your side
Or a thousand miles away
I'm forever, I'm for always
And for all my life
And until we meet again
I'm forever, I'm for always
