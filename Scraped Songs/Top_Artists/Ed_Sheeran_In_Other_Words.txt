Give me your eyes, bringing in the morning
Give me sunrise
Give me your smile, all your hidden corners
Give me surprise
Give me all your flaws and all your quirks
How you braid your hair and tie your shirts
Give me how you laugh, how you hurt, when you do
Give me how you eat and how you run
Give me what you hate and how you love
Give me what you hide away and think is uncool
Give me all your fears
Give me all your dreams
Give me all you're scared to lose
Give me all your future
Give me all your blues
In other words, give me all of you
Give me your time, I'll take any moment
My one for life
Give me your light and give me your shadow
I'm right by your side
Give me how you kiss and how you shout
To leave your clothes around our house
Give me how you checks the logs before we both sleep
Give me your ideas and "Babe, come here's"
And all your sad and happy tears
And how without your breakfast tea, you're incomplete
Give me all your hopes
Give me all your doubts
Give me all your workday news
Give me all your secrets
Give me all your truths
In other words, give me all of you
All of the stars in the moonlit sky
Couldn't match what you are to me
Give me your hand
Give me your forever
Give me the chance
Give me now and then
Give me promises
Give me there's nothing to prove
Give me all your wins
Give me all you lose
In other words, give me all of you
Give me all your dates
'Til our days are through
In other words, give me all of you
In other words, give me all of you
