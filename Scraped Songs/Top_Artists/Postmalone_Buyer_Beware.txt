It's been a while since I burned incense
I used my lighter for a pack of twenty
I don't know where the fuck my bible went
But I'm sure they'll forgive me
So please don't burn a hole in me
I-I, I know it seems like they got what you need
No one knows you better than yourself
So don't worry
You shouldn't spend your money on a dollar-store miracle
Sorry
Baby, I don't have the answers, even though I'm a know-it-all
So let it go; you'll never know—nothing's wrote in stone
You're your own oracle, it's just a fuckin' poem
Sorry
Baby, I don't have the answers even though I'm a know it all
So many restaurants in Beverly Hills
My favorite dinner comes in packs of twenty-four
I came home through the windowsill
But I'm sure that she'll forgive me
So please don't burn a hole in me
I-I, I know it seems like they got what you need
No one knows you better than yourself
So don't worry
You shouldn't spend your money on a dollar-store miracle
Sorry
Baby, I don't have the answers, even though I'm a know-it-all
So let it go; you'll never know—nothing's wrote in stone
You're your own oracle, it's just a fuckin' poem
Sorry
Baby, I don't have the answers, even though I'm a know-it-all
Let it go; you'll never know—nothing's wrote in stone
You're your own oracle, it's just a fuckin' poem
Sorry
Baby, I don't have the answers, shit, and maybe I know nothin' at all
