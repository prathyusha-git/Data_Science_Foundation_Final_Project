'83 Caddy with the big square body and the wheels got tucked in
Chewin' on a cigarette, lookin' at me funny, what the fuck you smoking?
Pop a Tommy collar, and I pop a couple mushies, and I let that shit soak in
Walk into the party, and my neck is on Bugatti, whole bitch got frozen
(Hah-hah, hah-hah) got them Lucchese boots on my feet
(Hah-hah, hah-hah) punch the gas 'til my leg falls asleep
(Hah-hah, hah-hah) and you know how it goes, ain't it sweet?
(Hah-hah, hah-hah) Texas tea (Hah-hah, hah-hah) uh, mm
Watch skeleton, baby, wanna bone me
Record companies really tryna clone me
Got these motherfuckers singin' karaoke
No one's Ginuwine, but they gon' ride my pony
Show the titties off; everybody notice me
Yeah, I'm very pretty everybody want to see
And I'm pretty used to everybody ogling
Now I got that bitch yodeling in bed, "I do"
(Hah-hah, hah-hah) twenty necklaces on, guillotine
(Hah-hah, hah-hah) call me daddy, she from Abilene
(Hah-hah, hah-hah) and you know how it goes, ain't it sweet?
(Hah-hah, hah-hah) Texas tea (Hah-hah, hah-hah), ah, mm
(Hah-hah, hah-hah) pour me something that's taller than me
(Hah-hah, hah-hah) ecstasy when the drink hits my teeth
(Hah-hah, hah-hah) and you know how it goes, ain't it sweet?
(Hah-hah, hah-hah) Texas tea (Hah-hah, hah-hah)
