One touch, electric shock
Eyes locked, like did you feel that too?
World stops, just us
Here under dots in the darkness of the blue
Out of the blue
Is this how it feels to be in love?
This is magical, this is magical
Is this how it feels to be in love?
This is magical, this is magical
Our lips barely one inch
Your skin brushed by my fingertips
Mornings, white mist
So delicate, covers as we begin
As we begin
Is this how it feels to be in love?
This is magical, this is magical
Is this how it feels to be in love?
This is magical, this is magical
Mm, no, no, no, no, no
Mm, mm, no, no, no, no
Silence is filled as time stands still
Our thoughts in the open room
Lay here until the sun distills
It's light, the perfect view
Now I'm with you
Is this how it feels to be in love?
This is magical, this is magical
Is this how it feels to be in love?
This is magical, this is magical
