I wrote this record while 30 thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
They'll probably think I'm a terrorist
Eat my asparagus, then I'm asking her
Thoughts of a young nigga, fast money and freedom
A crash dummy for dollars, I know you dyin' to meet 'em
I'll prob'ly die in a minute
Just bury me with 20 bitches, 20 million, and a Comptown fitted
Hol' up (hol' up)
Hol' up (hol' up)
Hol' up (hol' up)
Hol' up (hol' up)
Yeah, big shit poppin'
Section 80
Back in this bitch in the back of that bitch
With my back against the wall and your bitch on the edge of my dick
Jump off
I call a bitch a bitch, a ho a ho, a woman a woman
I never did nothing but break the ground on top of the asphalt
Tire mark gave you evidence that
I'm easily peddling with the speed of a lightning bolt
As a kid I killed two adults, I'm too advanced
I lived my 20's at two years old, the wiser man
Truth be told, I'm like 87
Wicked as 80 reverends in a pool of fire with devils holding hands
From the distance, don't know which one is a Christian, damn
Who can I trust in 2012?
There's no one not even myself
A Gemini screaming for help, somebody
Hol' up (hol' up)
Hol' up (hol' up)
Hol' up (hol' up)
Hol' up (hol' up)
Yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin'
When you do it like this, nigga, losin' ain't a option
Hol' up (hol' up)
Hol' up (hol' up)
Hol' up (hol' up)
Hol' up (hol' up)
Yeah, big shit poppin'
Ay, ay, kick her out the studio, Ali
24-7 nigga, workin' his ass for it, she poppin' that ass for it
The King of diamonds wit' diamonds I never do ask for
They checkin' my passport, I'm too accustomed with customs
She call in the task force, I killed it, somebody cuff 'em
They want me to fast forward the game, and why you complain
When you niggas is past poor, you'll never hop in my lane
When you pushin' a rav four, you wreckin' my Jaguar
You play like a bad sport, her feet on the dashboard
Hol' up (hol' up)
Hol' up (hol' up)
Hol' up (hol' up)
Hol' up (hol' up)
Yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin'
When you do it like this, nigga, losin' ain't a option
Hol' up (hol' up)
Hol' up (hol' up)
Hol' up (hol' up)
Hol' up (hol' up)
Yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin'
When you do it like this, nigga
I wrote this record while 30 thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
They'll probably think I'm Osama
The plane emergency landed, it was an honor, hol' up
