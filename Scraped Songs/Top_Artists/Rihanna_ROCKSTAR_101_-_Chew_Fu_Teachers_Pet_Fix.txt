Feeling so good
Looking so bad
Rocking this skirt
Rocking this club
Got my middle finger up

Feeling so good
Looking so bad
Rocking this skirt
Rocking this club
Got my middle finger up
I don't really give a fuck
Rocking these diamonds
I'm rocking this chain
Make sure you get a picture
I'm rocking my fame
To be with you is
You gotta be what you are
The only thing I'm missing
Is a black guitar
I'm a rock star
Hey baby
I'm a rock star
Hey baby
Big city
Bright lights
Sleep all day
Long night
Baby, I'm a rockstar

Big shit talker
I never play the victim
I'd rather be a stalker
So baby take me in
I'll disobey the law
Make sure you frisk me good
Check my panties and my bra
Wildin' out
A crazy house
With my white jacket on
Wont you come and sign me out
To be with you is
You gotta be what you are

Is a black guitar
