Oh darling
There's not much that you can say
To stop me from falling in
Like I am
Oh darling
Even waves can't wash away
Our names in the sand
Never could, never can
You are my everything
I gave up everything
Show me the darkest parts of your heart, I ain't gonna run
Every dance is slow, every kiss is whoa
They say you know when you know, well I know
I know you're the one
Some people bring you a million blessings
Some people teach you a million lessons
All that I learned, it wasn't my turn
It wasn't thе right time
Some peoplе come in your life for a reason
Others they come in your life for a season
But baby, you are a lifetime
Oh darling
There's no word that can describe
The way that I feel, tonight
Oh darling
I would walk that broken road
Time and time again
If it led me to your hello
You are my everything
I gave up everything
Show me darkest parts of your heart, I ain't gonna run
Every dance is slow, every kiss is whoa
They say you know when you know, well I know
I know you're the one
Some people bring you a million blessings
Some people teach you a million lessons
All that I learned, it wasn't my turn
It wasn't the right time
Some people come in your life for a reason
Others they come in your life for a season
Baby, you are a lifetime
Baby, you are a lifetime
