In the city, 'member used to drive a Yukon
I pick up whenever you call
In the parking lot in Tucson like are you wit' me
In the phantom with the roof gone
I pull up like Jimmy Neutron
I could help you get a move on like U-Haul
And I know
You like to go slow
But we could go faster
Tell me the password
Slide city, slide city
You know what that means
I'm coming up on you quickly, mhm
I bring nice things
Slide city slide
Plenty other men tryna get in the bed
So I'ma get slouched instead
I know it's gon' make you beg
What would I do if I didn't love you, baby?
What would I do if I didn't love you, baby?
What would I do if I didn't love you?

I just wanna be the one to give you what you want
I could put you in the Yves Saint Laurent
Riding round town with your hair done up
I know you like it when I tell you what you want
Keep you laying in the bed until tomorrow
