And all my friends take vitamins
Break off perfect pieces with violence
And outside
I'm burning my way through a stoplight
Baby, I'm fine
I'm just working my way through a deadline
♪
And all my friends invite 'em in
Light my cigarette and hope someone's watching
But to be honest, I fumble for the thrill of it
Innocent, militant-like
And outside
I'm burning my way through a stoplight
(La-la, la, la-la)
Baby, I'm fine
I'm just thumbin' my way through a landmine
(La-la, la, la-la)
And if you're getting sick of it
Imagine how I must feel (ooh, ooh)
But if you're getting rid of it
Then maybe I'll just keep some myself

Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah
