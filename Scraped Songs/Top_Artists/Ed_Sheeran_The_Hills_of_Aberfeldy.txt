Oh, the leaves are covered in snow
And the water's frozen
Oh, I long for you to be the one that I'm holdin'
And warm me down to my bones
As you lay beside me, hold me close
Oh, the leaves are starting to fall
And the sun grows cold
And my heart might break from the weight of it all
For all that I know
You could be holding somebody else as close
When I'm home, I'll hold you like I'm supposed to
Yet I know that I have never told you
Darling, we could fall in love
'Neath the hills of Aberfeldy

Oh, the ground is slowly melting
And the sun beats strong
And I feel like my feet may have wandered too long
And I will remain here alone
'Cause I fear that you may have found someone
And when I'm home, I'll hold you like I'm supposed to
Yet I know that I have never told you
But darling, we could fall in love
'Neath the hills of Aberfeldy
Darling, we could fall in love
'Neath the hills of Aberfeldy
♪
Wherever I go, I will always find
Another stranger to share in the weight of my crimes
And I know you will never find
Another heart that wants you more than mine
