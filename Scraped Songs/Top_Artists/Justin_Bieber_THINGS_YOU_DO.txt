I threw the towel (uh mhm)
When you came around (oh yea)
You stood your ground (mhm)
And that was attractive (ou yea)
Do it like you do
Driving me wild
Every morning (ohh)
Let's go for a drive
I know that you like it
Let's do it again
So do it again
Like you did when we were together (oh yea)
Please just, touch my back
Oh like you love to do ohh
The little things you that drive
Driving me crazy oh baby yea
It's the little things you do
You do
That's driving me wild
So wild
For always
All my days
Oh my babe
You did it again
