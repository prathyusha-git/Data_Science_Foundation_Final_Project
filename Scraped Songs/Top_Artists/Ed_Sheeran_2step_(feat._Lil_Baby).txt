I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break, something's got to change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then
We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low, then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all
Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us
Baby
Sun comin' up when we walk out, we lost the track of time
Everything that I been dealin' with ain't even crossed my mind
I don't see nobody in here but us, for real, for you I'm blind
We go anywhere, it don't take much for us to catch a vibe
Come here, I need to tell you something let me whisper in your ear
Do whatever to get you there, I'll put you on a Lear, yeah
Private island for a month straight, they'll think you disappeared
Lamb truck'll look good on you, I'm coppin' you that Urus
I think I'm 'bout ready to make love in this club
Only thing I need is my drink and my drugs
I done got on ten and forgot where I was
Some part I don't like, but this part I love
Only me and my guys
I been havin' me a good time, you can see it all in my eyes
Two-steppin' with shawty, got her rockin' side to side
You should let me know when you ready to ride 'cause
We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love (I love)
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low, then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all (night)
Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night
Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night
