La-di-da-da, da (I'd like to play)
La-da-da-da-di-da-da, la
Let me tell you, I'm out here from a very faraway place
All for the chance to be a star, nowhere seems to be too far
No more parties in LA
Please, baby, no more parties in LA, uh
No more parties in LA

Hey baby, you forgot your Ray-Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray tan
It was more than soft porn for the caveman
She remember my Sprinter, said, "I was in the grape van"
Uh, lil cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come Erykah Badu me, well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler (shake that body, party that body)
I show you the ropes, connect the dots (shake that body, party that body)
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice (Los Angeles)
Now it's Denny's, 4:00 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pourin' and niggas swarmin' your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R 'n' B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damagin' for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me
I mean, he flew you in this motherfucker on first class (Los Angeles)
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're makin' him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper (Los Angeles)
I said, "Baby, spin that round and say the alphabet backwards
You're dealin' with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence (shake that body, party-)
Just 'cause he a nerd, and you don't know what a condom is" (shake that body, party that-)
The head still good though, the head still good though
Make me say, "Nam-myoho-renge-kyo"
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles (let me tell you)
Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal (I'm out here, from a very)
Lord, have mercy, thou will not hurt me (faraway place)
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, movin' units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity
And yeah G, I was all for it (Los Angeles)
She said, "K. Lamar, you kind of dumb to be a poet (shake that body, party that body)
I'ma put you on game for the lames that don't know they're a rookie" (shake that body)
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy (pussy)
Scary

No more parties in LA
Please, baby, no more parties in LA
Friday night tryna make it into the city (Los Angeles)
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat somethin' pretty
Thinkin' back to how I got here in the first place (shake that body, party that body)
Second class bitches wouldn't let me on first base (shake that body, party that body)
A backpack nigga with luxury taste buds (Los Angeles)
And the Louis Vuitton store, got all of my pay stubs
Get pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only get hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
Earned three stacks man, you preacher it to the choir
Any rumour you ever heard about me was true and legendary (Los Angeles)
I done got Lewinsky and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets

The next generation will be the real victims (shake that body, party that body)
I can't fault 'em really (Los Angeles)
I remember Amber told my boy no matter what happen
She ain't going back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin' (let me tell you)
But don't worry, this one's so jammin' (I'm out here from a very far-)
You know it, LA, it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day, Mulholland Drive (the chance to be a star)
Need to put up some god-damn barricades, I be paranoid every time
The pressure, the problem ain't I be drivin', the problem is, I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive (Los Angeles)
That's why I'd rather take the 405 (shake that body, body that party)
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim (shake that body, body that party)
But Saint is baby Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
I had my life threatened by best friends who had selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do? Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Somethin' smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance (Los Angeles)
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezy's, some days I'm in my Vans (shake that body, body that party)
If I knew y'all made plans, I wouldn't have popped the Xanax (shake that body, body that party)

But the writer's block is over, Emcees cancel your plans
A 38-year-old, eight-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls, so I don't never drive it
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
God-damn, got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam, thank God for me (Los Angeles)
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewellery, a whole neck full
Bitches say he funny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes (Los Angeles)
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house (shake that body, body that party)
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out (shake that body, body that party)
We need the turbo thoughts, high speed, turbo thoughts
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop it like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep (I'm out here from a)
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep (very faraway place)
Get money, money, money, money (all for the chance)
Big, big money, money, money, money (to be a star, nowhere seems to be too far)
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker
I just keep on lovin' you, baby
And there's no one else I know who can take your place
