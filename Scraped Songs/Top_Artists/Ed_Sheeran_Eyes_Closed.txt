I know it's a bad idea
But how can I help myself?
Been inside for most this year
And I thought a few drinks, they might help
It's been a while, my dear
Dealin' with the cards life dealt
I'm still holdin' back these tears
While my friends are somewhere else
I pictured this year a little bit different
When it hit February
I step in the bar, it hit me so hard
Oh, how can it be this heavy?
Every song reminds me you're gone
And I feel the lump form in my throat
'Cause I'm here alone
Just dancin' with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you
And time is movin' so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancin' with my
Eyes, eyes closed
Eyes, so I'll keep dancin' with my-
Delusion is here again
And I think you'll come home soon
A word brings me right back in
Then it's only me that's in this room
I guess I could just pretend
The colours are more than blue
But I lost more than my friend
I can't help but missin' you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I pictured this month a little bit different
No one is ever ready
And when it unfolds, you get in a hole
Oh, how can it be this heavy?
Everything changes, nothing's the same
Except the truth is now you're gone
And life just goes on
So I'm dancin' with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you
And time is movin' so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancin' with my
Eyes, eyes closed
Eyes, so I'll keep dancin' with my
Eyes, eyes closed
Eyes, oh, I keep dancin' with my-
They're shutting the bar, they're cleanin' the floor
And everyone is already home, but I'm on my own
Still dancin' with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you
And time is movin' so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancin' with my
Eyes, eyes closed
Eyes, oh, I keep dancin' with my
Eyes, eyes closed
Eyes, oh, I keep dancin' with my
