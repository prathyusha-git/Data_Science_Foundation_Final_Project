Take off my disguise
I'm living someone else's life
Suppressing who I was inside
So, I throw two thousand ones in the sky
Together we're alone
In Los Angeles, I feel so at home
I'm falling only for the night
So, I throw two thousand ones in the sky
Well, how much to light up my star again?
And rewire my thoughts
Oh, baby, won't you remind me what I am?
And break, break my little cold heart?
Oh-whoa
Ooh-whoa, oh-whoa
Ooh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh, oh
