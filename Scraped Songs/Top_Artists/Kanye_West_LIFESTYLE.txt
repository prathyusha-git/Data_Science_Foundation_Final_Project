Look at you, look at you, look at you
Oh, they got you stayin' when them rooms got the lock on the minibar, uh
You gotta get out here, baby
You gotta get out here, baby
She wanna live this lifestyle
She wanna live this lifestyle
She wanna live this lifestyle
She said she ready to go
She said she, she said she, she said she ready
And I start talkin' dirty like I'm Nelly
Give me my lip service like the celly
Codeine and cocaine, that's lips tatted when it's Kelly
Ice up in my veins, old flames tryna melt me
I twist my Taylor spliffs tight at the end like Travis Kelce
Got that BBL, then you put on a couple lbs
BBWs been tryna eat me like I'm healthy
She say she wanna live this lifestyle
This life's a bitch, I make her love her like she dyked out
Oh, right now, you act like you 'bout that life now
Just hope your pussy lips give your pussy a nice smile
Ice on, the money long, wan' pay my lifelong
But if it ain't, it's all gravy like the rice gone
She sittin' on this D like you sittin' on your iPhone
And I'll beat it up to this song like this the fight song
Ooh, child, she want Tunechi, she want Tune' child
But cool down, I'm too classy for them schoolgrounds
Fast life, fast lane, check the gas like
You can't have your cake and eat it too, and I'm the last slice
She wanna live this lifestyle
She wanna live this lifestyle
She wanna live this lifestyle
She said she ready to go
She ready, she ready, she ready
She ready, she ready, she ready, yeah
She say she ready to go
Ooh, import that SLS Miami
She got them cheeks on, I'ma tap it all
This gon' be your theme song
We could take our time, baby
We won't be long, oh
So forgive me if I cop a little
Got so much ice around my neck, look like a chandelier
She want a nigga that gon' buy her the bag
Lookin' for a lil' baby that gon' know how to act
Remember at that rooftop when I seen you in that black bikini?
Looked to the city, you had never been in a Lamborghini
I'm 'bout to circle back, and it won't be too long
She always gon' choose me 'cause I know what she want
She wanna live this lifestyle (yeah)
She wanna live this lifestyle (ooh)
She wanna live this lifestyle (oh, yeah)
She said she ready to go
She ready, she ready (oh, yeah), she ready
She ready, she ready (oh, ooh), she ready, yeah
She say she ready to go
Neighbors know this shit get out of hand, but they smile
'Cause you been so long without a man
And it won't be
And it won't be long 'til you're out of bands
(You better buy me those fuckin' shoes) (ew)
The only thing you really need is a husband
The only thing you really need is a husband
The only thought you ever need is, "I trust him"
All your dreams, all your goals
It's promised with this ring I have in my hands
The main thing a nigga got is these plans
Got a plan for us, got a plan to grow
Got a plan for homes, got a plan for bad times
Got a plan for good times, got a plan for hood times
Got a plan for hood crimes, got a plan for trust
Got a plan for lust
Got a plan for Beverly Hills
You kn-, you know that's where they at (uh-uh-uh)
You know that's where they at
Got a plan for Beverly Hills
You know that's where they at
I don't really wanna go back to that
If I do, I know I'm going back to back
Breakin' backs and bags, imagine that
That's the half of this
So I handle that
All you really need is a husband
Show you love and let him touch you
Let him rub you, let him hug you
Let him thug you, let him hold you down
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
All you need is a husband
Who gon' touch you, who gon' rub you
Who gon' hug you, who gon' kiss you
Who gon' miss you with no issue
With no issue, ain't no issue
Ain't no issue
