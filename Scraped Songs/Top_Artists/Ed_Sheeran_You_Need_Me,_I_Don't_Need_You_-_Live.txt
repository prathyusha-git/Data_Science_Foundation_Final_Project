Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now
See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me
I sing and write my own tune
And I write my own verse? Hell
Don't need another word-smith to make my tune sell?
Call yourself a singer-writer. You're just bluffing
Your name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at The Enterprise when some fella filmed me
'A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi'
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me
And all I want in this cold world
Is to make music and use it not to abuse it and
get infected effected with the who's who of music
Who did it? Who is it? Who's in it?
Or what the hell does it matter?
Chitter chatter don't matter what a
Yidda yidda yadda don't matta to me
All I want is a bit of dignity in me
To battle this industry freely
To be me in this seedy needy world
Can you hear me?
Hey
So I keep singin that
When I first started this rappin shit I felt pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
I made for the stars
Kept my grime in the dark
Then I payed with remedy kickin rhymes with the melody
Henesey shots and all these fools on the block who said
you got to be a gangsta now to raise the top
Just a normal casual usual everyday type of guy
With my hand in the sky, ready to die
Ed Sheeran alone star, coming at here freestyling with the guitar
'Cause I forgot the lyrics on this bit right here
So I'll freestyle op the top with the bit with that bear
You get it in the club, bottle full of bub
Mummy I've got the X if you're into takin drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough
You can find me in the club
Mummy I've got the X if you're into takin drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red
I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning on a spliff off your high grade
My eyes are red I've been burning I've been burning burning burning
Now where I come from burning weed it is a habit
A big fat bag of high grade weed I got to have it
Cos if I don't have it in my pocket I'm gonna panic
Cos like I said where I come from yeah smoking it is a habit
Yup to do the bun to blaze the place up in the hood
one them things I inherited like a ghetto man should
Whenever I'm smoking weed yes it makes me feel good
Yes high grade weed yes it makes me feel
Yes it is a drug and if I start to smoke it I'mma turn into a thug
Where I come from the talking could only get you mugged
Where I come from burning weed is a blessing from above
Where I come from yes we burn it when we listen rub a dove
Where I come from after we burn it we has to make love
Where I come from yes we burn it when the sun starts shine
I blaze high grade weed all the time!
Now my eyes are red
Cause you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
And you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you
Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop till my name's in lights
At stadium heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young and all my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
Yep The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows
But I haven't got a house plus I live on the couch
So you can be the lyrics when I'm singing them out
(Wow)
From day one, I've been prepared
With vo5 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa, giving a dose of what the future holds
Cause it's another day
Rucksack with old clothes
I rap with the cold flows, I'm back with the old jokes
In fact you don't know
On tracks I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate
My flow's developing, skin lacks the melanin
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in
Do it for the hell of it cause ever since I hit the
mainstream with the A Team I seem to sell a bit
I took what held me back with the women
I packaged the image, put in some content, then sold it back as a gimmick
fact is this I'll end up dating actresses wake up on dirty mattresses,
I think i'll need to practice this
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative
World's on my shoulders I don't even know what atlas is
Hard bars, sharp like a cactus is
I'm back to rapping back to backers
I'll be practicing now I'm back to singing this
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, soon as I get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator
