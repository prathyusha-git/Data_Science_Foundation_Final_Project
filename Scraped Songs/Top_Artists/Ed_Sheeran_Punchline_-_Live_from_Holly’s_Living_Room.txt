I can't help but be destructive right now
It's been weeks since I saw your outline
In my room is a silence so loud
This is what losing hope might sound like
Put me down so I'm in my place
Say it's over for breathing space
All I was, was a route to change
Is this just growing up?
I might seem too distracted right now
It's been so long I've been the punchline
I stand naked while these clothes dry out
Leave me drowning to edit the runtime
Put me down so I'm in my place
Say it's over for breathing space
All I was, was a route to change
Is this just growing up?
All this love could not seal my fate
Low is all that I've been of late
Caught in webs I wove with my mistakes
This is growing up
I can't help it, but I love you so
I can't take this letting go
I still feel that we could work it out or something
All I am is only flesh and bone
Why's your heart so freezing cold?
Don't you leave your weight on me, on me
I can't help it, but I love you so
I can't take this letting go
I still feel that we could work it out or something
All I am is only flesh and bone
Why's your heart so freezing cold?
Don't you leave your weight on me, on me
Can't help it, no
No, I can't help it, no
I will never let you go
I will never let you go
No, I can't help it, no
No, I can't help it, no
I will never let you go
I will never let you go
