Wherever I go, I'm never alone
Even when I am in all my darkest moments
Whatever I do, there's something of you
Through the cracks you're the light that is ever glowing
If I think that we can't get any closer
You say yes we can
And freedom is knowing there's somebody you can lean on
Turning the confusion into meaning
Someone who loves your angels and your demons
Loving you is freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Loving you is
Wherever you go, I'll always be home
Even when little things make it complicated
Whatever you do, I'll be there for you
We don't want perfect love cause that's overrated
When I lose my direction on the journey
You will take my hand
And freedom is knowing there's somebody you can lean on
Turning the confusion into meaning
Someone who loves your angels and your demons
When you want it but don't need it
That is freedom
Being safe to feel whatever you are feeling
And trusting that it's there when you don't see it
To open up your eyes and still be dreaming
Loving you is freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Loving you is freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Loving you is freedom
It's knowing there's somebody you can lean on
Turning the confusion into meaning
Someone who loves your angels and your demons
When you want it but don't need it that is freedom
It's safe to feel whatever you are feeling
It's trusting that it's there when you don't see it
To open up your eyes and still be dreaming
Loving you is freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Loving you is freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Loving you is freedom
It's knowing when there's hurting there is healing
We can make it work when we believe it
Baby you're the answer and the reason
Loving you is
