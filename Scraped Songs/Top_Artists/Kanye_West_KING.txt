After everything said, huh, man, man
After everything said, huh, man, man
"Crazy, bipolar, antisemite"
And I'm still the king
Still the king
Still
They thought headlines was my kryptonite
Still the king
Still the king
This what y'all been waitin' for, huh?
Guess a real nigga couldn't take no more, huh
Niggas mad 'cause they can't talk to Ye no more, huh
It was fucks given, now it ain't no more, huh
If you ain't mean it, what you say it for, huh?
She just wanna fuck at the Bottega store, huh
When she suck me off, I should be payin' more, huh
Attention to my bitch 'cause she actin' like a slut
Bring four sluts right now
Shut the hell up 'fore you get exiled
And, I'm still
"Crazy, bipolar, antisemite"
And I'm still the king
They thought headlines was my kryptonite, bitch
I'm still the king
I'm still the king
Paparazzi love me, they show up to everything
I can pay you double, let me put you on the team
White Castle to Italian castles, we did everything
Sold out every stadium, bitch, we got every ring
I don't give a - uh-uh, ooh
Why? Mmm, the king
All that word of mouth couldn't take me out, huh-huh
After all of that, your kids in the house goin' crazy
'Cause I'm still the king
Still the king
Still the king
Deadlines, I gave a shit, like-
Still the king
Still the king
