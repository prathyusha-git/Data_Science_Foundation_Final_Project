Said
I saw the fire in your eyes
I saw the fire when I look into your eyes
You tell me things you wanna try
I know temptation is the devil in disguise
You risk it all to feel alive, ooh, yeah
(You're offering yourself to me like sacrifice)
You said you do this all the time
Tell me you love me when I bring you to the light
So, I say
It's like a dream what she feels with me
She likes to be on the edge
Her fantasy is okay with me
Then suddenly, baby says
Said
Take my breath away
And make it last forever, babe
Do it now or never, baby
Take my breath away
Nobody does it better, babe
Bring me close to heaven, baby
Take my breath
