She don't like the flash
Wanna keep us in the dark
She don't like the fame
Baby when we're miles apart
And she getting to the point where
It's too much for
And she wanna throw us all away
It's too much for
She don't want a thing 'cause the world knows who we are
She don't like the lights
Woah-oh-oh-oh
She don't, she don't, she don't
She don't like the lights
Woah-oh-oh-oh
She don't, she don't
Don't wanna share no one else
Want me for herself
Don't want no love in front of the camera
She don't like the lights
Woah-oh-oh-oh babe
She don't, she don't
She don't like the lights
♪
She's giving ultimatums
She don't like this live, yeah
She said if I loved her
I'd give it up won't think twice
I can't do that
And it's getting to the point
Where it's too much for
Wanna throw it all away
'Cause it's too much for
She don't wanna live this life
She don't like the lights
Woah-oh-oh-oh
She don't, she don't
She don't like the lights
Woah-oh-oh-oh
She don't, she don't
Don't wanna share no one else
Want me to herself
Don't want no love in front of the camera
She don't like the lights
Woah-oh-oh-oh
She don't, she don't
She don't like the lights
Why can I choose between the two
One of the nights I'll run right now
I wish she could see
How good this can be
I hope she waits a little bit longer
'Cause I don't wanna live life
Without her by my side
She gets the light that is in me
But she don't know
Woah-oh-woah-oh
She don't like the lights
