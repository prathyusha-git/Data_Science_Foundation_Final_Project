Did you think I'd show up in a limousine? No
Had to save my money for security
Got a stalker walking up and down the street
Says he's Satan and he'd like to meet
I bought a secret house when I was 17
Haven't had a party since I got the keys
Had a pretty boy over, but he couldn't stay
On his way out, made him sign an NDA
♪
Yeah, I made him sign an NDA
Once was good enough
'Cause I don't want him having shit to say
♪
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no
I can crave you, but you don't need to know
♪
30 Under 30 for another year
I can barely go outside, I think I hate it here
Maybe I should think about a new career
Somewhere in Kauai where I can disappear
I've been having fun, getting older now
Didn't change my number, made him shut his mouth
At least I gave him something he can cry about
I thought about my future, but I want it now
Want it now
♪
You can't give me up
♪
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no
I can crave you, but you don't need to know
♪
Did I take it too far?
Now I know what you are
You hit me so hard
I saw stars
Think I took it too far
When I sold you my heart
How'd it get so dark?
I saw stars
Stars
