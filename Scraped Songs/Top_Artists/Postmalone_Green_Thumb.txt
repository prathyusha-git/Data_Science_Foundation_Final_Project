Da-da, da-dum
Drove by your house and noticed it was overgrown
Your flowers are all dead, and I thought you should know
What happened to your green thumb that you were so proud of?
The bodies were scattered and starving for love
Starving for love
But one, one, one was on his deathbed
He told me you left long ago, oh, no
He said, with his last breath
"Wake up, she's not coming home"
♪
Da-da, da-dum
He must be so cool and on a motorcycle
Buy you new flowers to replace what you left
My new love pours herself out more than I'd like
Her name is Brandy, we'll be married tonight
Married tonight
When I, I, I, I'm on my deathbed
I'll remember you left long ago, oh, no
I hear the nurse say
"Goodnight, she's never coming home"
