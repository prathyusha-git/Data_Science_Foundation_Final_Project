Throwing pedals like do you love me or not
Head is spinning and it don't know when to stop
Cause you said forever babe did you mean it or not
Hold on hold on
You leave me on read babe but I still get the message
Instead of a line its 3 dots but I can connect em
And if it ain't right babe
You know I respect it
But if you need time just take your time
Honey I get it I get it I get it
The way you got me all in my head
Think I'd rather you in my bed
Whatever it is you know I can take it
I'm counting the days how many days
Til I can see you again
Blowing kisses like will you catch 'em or not
I'm Cupid with arrows babe I'm just shooting my shot mhmm
If I could get in drop me a pin
Hop in the — and come over
Don't wanna be friends just skin to skin
I wanna get closer and closer and closer
The way you got me all in my head
Think I'd rather you in my bed
Whatever it is you know I can take it
I'm counting the days how many days
Til I can see you again
You got me all in my feelings
And you got me all I've been all in my feelings
And you got me all weak in my knees every time
Cause you got me all, all in my feelings
♪
The way you got me all in my head
Think I'd rather you in my bed
Whatever it is you know I can take it
I'm counting the days how many days
Til I can see you again
