Kisses don't, no, they don't, never don't lie
You can run if you want, but you can't hide
Tellin' you it's the truth, don't you ask why
Kisses don't, no, they don't, kisses don't lie
Emotions come and go
Who knows how the wind will blow?
There's so little in this world to trust in
Seduce themselves with lies
Some don't realize
They call it love, but it's really only lustin', yeah
So you see, you and me
We're getting close to danger zone
Show me how, tell me now
Should I stay or should I go?
'Cause I'm caught between yes and no
'Cause when you kiss me
I feel everythin' that I've been missin'
I try to slow down, but my heart won't listen
And it's tearing me all up inside
And when you touch me
I feel a rush, but I'm afraid that it might crush me
Should I put my trust in somethin' I don't trust in?
I try to run, but there's no place to hide
'Cause, baby, kisses don't lie
Kisses don't, no, they don't, never don't lie (baby, kisses don't lie)
You can run if you want, but you can't hide
Telling you it's the truth, don't you ask why (whoa)
Kisses don't, no, they don't, kisses don't lie (whoa)
You whisper in my ear
But are your words sincere?
'Cause pretty words can cut just like a knife
You see I'm nobody's fool
I play by my own rules
So please think twice before you step into my life
So you see, you and me
We're getting close to the danger zone
Show me how, tell me now
Should I stay or should I go?
'Cause I'm caught between yes and no
'Cause when you kiss me
I feel everything that I've been missing
I try to slow down, but my heart won't listen (listen, hey, oh)
And it's tearing me all up inside (inside)
And when you touch me
I feel a rush, but I'm afraid that it might crush me (crush me, baby)
Should I put my trust in somethin' I don't trust in? (Trust in, hey, yeah)
I try to run, but there's no place to hide
'Cause, baby, kisses don't lie
Kisses don't, no, they don't, never don't lie (don't lie)
(Baby, kisses don't lie) you can run if you want but you can't hide
Telling you it's the truth, don't you ask why (whoa)
Kisses don't, no, they don't, kisses don't lie (whoa)
Kisses don't, no, they don't, never don't lie
You can run if you want, but you can't hide
Telling you it's the truth, don't you ask why
Kisses don't, no, they don't, kisses don't lie
So you see, you and me
We're getting close to danger zone
Show me how, tell me now
Should I stay or should I go?
'Cause I'm caught between yes and no
'Cause when you kiss me (kiss me)
I feel everything that I've been missing (missin')
I try to slow down, but my heart won't listen (just won't listen, baby, hey)
And it's tearing me all up inside (whoa, inside)
And when you touch me
I feel a rush, but I'm afraid that it might crush me
Should I put my trust in somethin' I don't trust in? (Trust in, baby, yeah)
I try to run, but there's no place to hide
'Cause, baby, kisses don't lie
Kisses don't, no, they don't, never don't lie (kisses don't lie)
You can run if you want, but you can't hide (whoa, whoa, whoa)
Telling you it's the truth, don't you ask why
Kisses don't, no, they don't, kisses don't lie
