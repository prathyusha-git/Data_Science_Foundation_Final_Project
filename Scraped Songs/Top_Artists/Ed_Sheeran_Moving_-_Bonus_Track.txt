This is the last song I'm writing 'bout you
Up 'til now, well, I'd never tried to
You don't feel any kind of pain like I do
So, let's forget it even happened, babe
You're all I thought about whenever I woke
And all I'd talk about whenever I spoke
All I'd sing when I would hit the high notes
But now, it doesn't even matter
If you come back
It's like we never even had that
Every moment when you took my joy away
All the memories mean nothing from today
Up 'til now, I never hold back
True emotion make me feel sad
But I never wanna hear your name again
And go back to how it was before you came
Start moving on, moving on
♪
I feel on a roll since you've been gone
Start moving on, moving on
♪
Out of my life, life
Where you belong
♪
This is the last time I'm thinking 'bout you
I used to cry, but then, was it a crime too?
I spent a lifetime trying to make the right moves
And got myself caught in a pattern, babe
You take a smile and then you turn it to dust
You take what's gold and then you somehow make rust
Every lie, it made it harder to trust
But now, it doesn't even matter
If you come back
It's like we never even had that
Every moment when you took my joy away
All the memories mean nothing from today
Up 'til now, I never hold back
True emotion make me feel sad
But I never wanna hear your name again
And go back to how it was before you came
Start moving on, moving on
I feel on a roll since you've been gone
Start moving on, moving on
Out of my life, life
Where you belong
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do (hey)
Do-do-do-do-do (hey, ooh)
Do-do-do-do-do (yeah)
Do-do-do-do-do
Start moving on, moving on
♪
I feel on a roll since you've been gone
Start moving on, moving on

Out of my life, life

Where you belong
