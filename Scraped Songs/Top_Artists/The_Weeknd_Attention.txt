Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Baby, you were so strong
Baby, you were calm, you were so calm, yeah
Tell me where it went wrong
Tell me how to love, it's been so long
When a call's not enough, yeah
And you just need to touch
Thinking twice, I'm the one
But you just need to trust
You're only looking for attention
You only notice it 'cause I'm never around
You're only looking for attention, oh, oh
You're only looking for attention
The only problem is you'll never get enough
You're only looking for attention, oh, oh
What do you expect now?
Only thing left is the sex now
'Cause baby, too vexed now
Only see me on the TV or the bed now
When a touch not enough
You were more than a fuck
Thinking twice, I'm the one
But you just need to trust
You're only looking for attention
You only notice it 'cause I'm never around
You're only looking for attention, oh, oh
You're only looking for attention
The only problem is you'll never get enough
You're only looking for attention, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Attention
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (love and attention, baby)
Attention
You're only looking for attention
You only notice it 'cause I'm never around
You're only looking for attention, oh, oh
You're only looking for attention
The only problem is you'll never get enough
You're only looking for attention, oh, oh-oh
