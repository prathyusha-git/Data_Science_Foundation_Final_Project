I got a call from my mother who wishes she was here
A couple cards in the post that I'm reading
I want the warmth of the summer, the cold too cold to bear
The only plus is the sweater, I need it
I broke apart from my lover a couple months ago
If they were there, then I guess I wouldn't be alone
This is the life in the city, and that's the way it goes
It's a fine excuse just to leave it
I hit 'em up, and I asked, "Are you comin' over?"
And all I got was a shrug and an "I don't know"
Everyone I know is hidden away
Tryin' to make their bodies clean again
They don't want to celebrate
Nobody cares this is the day I was born
Always the month when parties come to an end
The same excuses from every friend
Another year, and now we're here again
Nobody cares this is the day I was born
Another birthday alone
La-la, lay-la, la, lay, lay
Another birthday alone
La-la, lay-la, la, lay, lay
I hit a bar in town, give my card to start a tab
Every year that we're here, well, we're never gettin' back
So I'll drink for the confidence 'cause that's what I lack
And end up talkin' to strangers to find another plan
I end the night in a cab, head spinnin', on my own
Watchin' pointless shit and flickin' through my phone
And would April be better? I guess I'll never know
Get my keys out my pocket and stumble into home
I feel low, but I guess I could feel lower
I'm heading down, and now I'm on a roll
'Cause everyone I know is hidden away
Tryin' to make their bodies clean again
They don't want to celebrate
Nobody cares this is the day I was born
Always the month when parties come to an end
The same excuses from every friend
Another year, and now we're here again
Nobody cares this is the day I was born
Another birthday alone
La-la, lay-la, la, lay, lay
Another birthday alone
La-la, lay-la, la, lay, lay
I feel hit 'em up, and I asked, "Are you comin' over?"
And all I got was a shrug and an "I don't know"
'Cause everyone I know is hidden away
Tryin' to make their bodies clean again
They don't want to celebrate
Nobody cares this is the day I was born
Always the month when parties come to an end
The same excuses from every friend
Another year, and now we're here again
Nobody cares this is the day I was born
Another birthday alone
La-la, lay-la, la, lay, lay
Another birthday alone
La-la, lay-la, la, lay, lay
Another birthday alone
Another birthday alone
