You should tell me whats buggin you
And Imma tell ya bout me
Make a wish and tell me your deepest thoughts
And Imma make it easy
Emotions running wild
I could feel it when I'm next to you
Something's on ya mind
You wanna stay but wont tell me
Its about ya secrecy
So what are you tryna hide?
I know what the look means
You hold my hand so tightly
Whenever we say goodbye
Standing by the door
I could tell you can't take no more
Blow your secret open wide
So maybe if you say it
Tell me what it is you likeeee (likee)
Baby baby dont be shy
Maybe you can spend the night
If you say it
But if you playin (not wit it)
Cuz you know what I wanna hear (hear)
Say it, that'll make it more clear (clear)
I need to know how you feel
So baby why wont you (say it), say it (say it)

Your eyes steady talking
And your tryna fight it
But some things baby are not worth hiding
And we can find heaven
If we go look together
So won't, won't you tell me
And get it off your chest
