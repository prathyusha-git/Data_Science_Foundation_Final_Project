I overthink and have trouble sleeping
All purpose gone and don't have a reason
There's no doctor to stop this bleeding
So I left home and jumped in the deep end
Took a job for dad, I think just to please him
So when I quit, I just kept it secret
I have friends, no longer see them
It's just me, and now all my demons
Are heavy weighing on my heart
I guess I'm done already, all but given up
I'm burning days 'til the weekends
Start, I just pretend I'm not where I am
Should I cancel my plans?
Saturday night is giving me a reason to rely on the strobe lights
The lifeline of a promise in a shot glass, and I'll take that
If you're giving out love from a plastic bag
Saturday night is giving me a reason to rely on the strobe light
The lifeline of a promise in a shot glass, and I'll take that
If you're giving out love from a plastic bag
My friend died, it's been years, still grieving
And I thought time would be somehow healing
When love finds me, I'm too numb to feel it
Why the fuck am I still here breathing?
Oh, I would pray, but I don't believe it
Woe is me, but I don't care either
Life is not the way that it seems, but
Maybe this will all be a dream now
I'll stay steady, balance on the rope
I guess that I'm not ready to rely on the hope
I'm burning days 'til the weekend
Start, I just pretend I'm not where I am
Should I cancel my plans?
Saturday night is giving me a reason to rely on the strobe lights
The lifeline of a promise in a shot glass, and I'll take that
If you're giving out love from a plastic bag
Saturday night is giving me a reason to rely on the strobe light
The lifeline of a promise in a shot glass, and I'll take that
If you're giving out love from a plastic bag
I'm a wreck headed
Take me to the other side
Don't look in my eyes
Oh, whoa
It's almost morning, I'm still not leaving
It's wearing off, but I still can feel it
Another one and I'll touch the ceiling
This is all I want to be
Saturday night is giving me a reason to rely on the strobe lights
The lifeline of a promise in a shot glass, and I'll take that
If you're giving out love from a plastic bag
Saturday night is giving me a reason to rely on the strobe light
The lifeline of a promise in a shot glass, and I'll take that
If you're giving out love from a plastic bag
