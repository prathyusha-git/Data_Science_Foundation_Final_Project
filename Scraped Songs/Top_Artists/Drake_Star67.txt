That's what they doin' Cam'ron
They actin' like these singers, man
"I ain't-I ain't goin' to the studio 'til I got a situation
A subject, I need a beat, I need the producer
Who-who gon' be on the hook?" Man, what is you doin'?
Go in the studio with fuckin' clips, clips, ammo
Brand-new Beretta, can't wait to let it go
Walk up in my label like, "Where the check, though?"
Yeah, I said it
Wouldn't dap you with the left, hoe, shut the fuck up
Text from a centerfold, I ain't reply, let her know I read it though
Voicemail say she ready though (yeah)
Niggas know I'm credible
Ain't no pussy on a pedestal
Got my foot on the 'Cedes Benz pedal
Doin' 90 on the bridge like, "Nigga you already know"
And if you don't know, then now you know, now you know (now you know)
Switchin' up the angles
Now I'm in the Rolls with illuminated angel
Four, five chains man, the gold getting tangled
My nigga Biz said, "The first mill' gon' change you"
Change for the better, hit it, then dead her
That's my vendetta, keep this shit together, yeah
Goddamn, we ain't even gotta scam
Cocaine Coupe, we ain't even got a scale
Used to flip apps, now that old plug murked
Ain't a damn thing changed, you can still get to work, ay
(Just hold on one moment and someone will be right with you)
(We're sorry, you have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service)
Yeah
I remember I had went to Louis V with Haf'
Watched them spread ten thousand dollars on the glass
I never, ever thought I'd see that in my life
Now I'm in the East 'cause 'em boys are gettin' right, man
I was on TV makin' 50 racks a year
After helpin' Mama out, the shit would disappear
I am not a man, I can't do this on my own
So I started askin' them if they would put me on
And they did put me on
Yeah, they did put me on
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phones
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phones, man (6ix)
Line blowin' up, workin' on the phones
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phones
But I just couldn't do it, had to leave that shit alone, man
Hear what?
Yo, hear what, take time
(Ha, ha, ha) ah, no shit
Yo, hear what?
Wha gwan, fry skull
Him fried, him fried and a sleep awhile ago inna di van, you know Drizzy
Blowin' up
Line blowin' up, they need the whole thing
Blowin' up
My niggas really need the whole thing, yeah, yeah
Blowin' up
Line blowin' up, they need the whole thing
Blowin' up
My niggas really need the whole thing, yeah, yeah
Ay
I do better with the rider in my system
Ooh yeah, I'm on deck, when you call me, I'll listen
I listen unless I been mixing
You know when I'm mixing
You know when I'm mixing, I smoke when I drink, it's tradition
Like Zoe mama, I go hippy
Peace sign in the air like I'm Nixon
I'm mixing, I am not Esco but it was written
I knew when they didn't
I been had these visions of the life I'm living since I was Jimmy
All I just had to do was just go and get it
And now we blowin' up
Blowin' up, they need the whole thing
Blowin' up, yeah
My niggas really need the whole thing, yeah, yeah
Ay
