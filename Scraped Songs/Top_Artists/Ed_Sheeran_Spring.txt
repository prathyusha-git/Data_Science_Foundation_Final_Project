Where is my mind? I've lost the nerve
This year flew by without a word
I had a plan to cross the world
But haven't left this island
The stores closed down and opened up
I said I'd do a sober month
I failed, but tried and wrote this drunk
In overwhelming silence
And I'll see my friends
When all this ends
But now until then
I'm holding out for spring
We can't let winter win
That's why I'm holding out for spring
Oh, what a state we're in
I'll keep holding out for spring
♪
Homework and cancelled holidays
The blame gets passed to save a face
The smell of last night's takeaway
Just tells me I'm a mess
Still watching shows they recommend
That don't get good until the end
And I could be unwell, but then again
Maybe I'm just depressed
And I'll fix my head
When all this ends
But now until then
I'm holding out for spring
We can't let winter win
That's why I'm holding out for spring
Oh, what a state we're in
I'll keep holding out for spring
Time, blue skies
Frost fades, slowly
Crossed my mind to linger
And hold out for spring
We can't let winter win
That's why I'm holding out for spring
Oh, what a state we're in
