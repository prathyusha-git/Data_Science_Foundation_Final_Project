Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah
Listen, closely
Hear the music playin'
Let it take you to places far away and relax your senses
Just do what you wanna do
No need for questions
It's only for you
And it's so amazing, oh, how you can't escape it
The movement takes you and never let's you go
Can't you feel the music in the air?
Close your eyes, let the rhythm take you there
Doesn't matter who you are or where you're from
Come and dance to the music of the sun
Forget about your troubles, it's alright
Let 'em go 'til we see the morning light
Feel the beat as our bodies move as one
Come and dance to the music of the sun (the sun)
Come and dance to the music of the sun, the sun (the sun, yeah)
So real, so right
Can't explain the feeling
Like the sunlight brings to life new meaning
No need for stress (no need for stress)
Save that for another day
No second guessing
Just trust me when I say
And it's so amazing, oh, how you can't escape it
The movement takes you and never let's you go
Can't you feel the music in the air?
Close your eyes, let the rhythm take you there (let the rhythm take you there)
Doesn't matter who you are or where you're from
Come and dance to the music of the sun (music of the sun)

Feel the beat as our bodies move as one
Come and dance to the music of the sun (come and dance to the music of the sun)
Come and dance to the music of the sun, the sun (of the sun, oh, yeah)
