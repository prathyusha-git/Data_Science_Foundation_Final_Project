Anesthesia
Adenosine, uh
And that's my favorite girl
No, I never felt anything better than this
You can tell by the look on my face
Nothing lasts forever, so I look at my wrist
Dopamine overdose
No, I never felt anything better than this
I would give up my tongue for a taste
Even though I know it's catch-and-release
Dopamine overdose
Put on my old coat, and I found new drugs
Wanna thank young me for getting me fucked up
And a distant relative just bit the dust
Somehow, I'm in the will for a million bucks
And baby, I just won a free fucking trip to Disneyland
I just got a second blue check on Instagram
Oh, and it feels so good tonight
Let's hang like we're never gonna get it back
No, I never felt anything better than this
You can tell by the look on my face
Nothing lasts forever, so I look at my wrist
Dopamine overdose
No, I never felt anything better than this
I would give up my tongue for a taste
Even though I know it's catch-and-release
Dopamine overdose
Big sigh, ooh, what a ride
It's for life, then I changed my mind
Penthouse, but I lost my room key
Another minute, another problem, another brew ski
Yeah, you know, it's funny how it goes
When everything is nothing 'cause all I ever wanted was more
And it feels so good tonight
Let's hang like we are never gonna get it back
No, I never felt anything better than this
You can tell by the look on my face
Nothing lasts forever, so I look at my wrist
Dopamine overdose
No, I never felt anything better than this
I would give up my tongue for a taste
Even though I know it's catch-and-release
Dopamine overdose
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Overdose
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Overdose
