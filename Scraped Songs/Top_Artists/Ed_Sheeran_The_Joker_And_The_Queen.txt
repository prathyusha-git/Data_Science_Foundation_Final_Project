How was I to know? It's a crazy thing
I showed you my hand, and you still let me win
And who was I to say that this was meant to be
The road that was broken brought us together
And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen
I was upside down, from the outside in
You came to the table and you went all in
With a single word and a gentle touch
You turned a moment into forever

And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
