Yeah, yeah
Mmm, ayy
Candy paint with the white on top
Lambo doors are the woo-wop drop
If you busy plotting on what I got
Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thought
100 thousand dollars on the table-top
Half price my whip, same price my watch
Got no jumper but I ball a lot
Bitch, I'm Young Stoney, I do what I want
Candy paint with the white on top (skrrt)
Lambo doors are the woo-wop drop (drop)
If you busy plotting on what I got
Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thought (pop)
100 thousand dollars on the table-top
Half price my whip, same price my watch (bling)
Got no jumper but I ball a lot (swish)
Bitch, I'm Young Stoney, I do what I want
Didn't know that was your girl when she gave me top (yeah)
Kicked her out the rolls said, "Thanks a lot"
Goddamn I love paper like I'm Michael Scott (yeah)
I can do things that your man cannot (yeah)
Slide boy comin' down, damn, I'm hot (hot)
Everybody say that I gotta be stopped (stopped)
Even though my final form ain't unlocked (locked)
I'm so ahead of you motherfuckers
How you comprehend what you ain't understanding?
Count a 100 bands and I watch it vanish
Diamonds going crazy like they on the dance floor
Got a lot of ass, nothing I can't handle
Flavor lasts forever, you should try a sample (goddamn)
Baby, I'm the boss like I'm Tony Danza (Tony Danza)
Everybody trying to tell me what I stand for
But you don't fucking know me, homie, you don't want war (ayy)

I've been rolling 20 ash, hit the road (whoa)
Hit the switch up the suicide doors (damn)
We already know you vanished though (oh)
Hit my momma when I ride in that, oh
All these motherfuckers so false with me (yah)
If your money funny, don't talk to me (nah)
I know there ain't shit that you could offer me (no)
Take a second if you think about crossing me
It last forever, you should try a sample (goddamn)

Everybody trying to tell me what I stand for (what I stand for)
