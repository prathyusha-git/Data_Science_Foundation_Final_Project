He hath come to the bosom of his beloved
Smiling on him, she beareth him to highest heav'n
With yearning heart
On thee we gaze
O' gold-winged messenger of mighty Gods

Goldwing angel
Go home
Don't tell anyone what you are
You're sacred and they're starved
And their art is getting dark
And there you are to tear apart
Tear apart, tear apart, tear apart
You better keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
Better keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
They're gonna tell you what you wanna hear
Then they're gonna disappear
Gonna claim you like you a souvenir
Just to sell you in a year
You better keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
Keep your head down-down (keep your head down-down-down)
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
Better keep your head down-down (down-down-down-down-down)
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
Keep your head down-down (down-down-down-down-down-down)
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
That's good
