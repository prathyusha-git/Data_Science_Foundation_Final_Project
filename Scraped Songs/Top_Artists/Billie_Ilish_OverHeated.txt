I don't really even know how it happened
I started talking, they started laughing
I don't really even know how it happened
I started watching them photographing
I don't really (I don't really) how it happened
Instead of stopping, they still were flashing (I don't really)
I started walking (I don't really), gave no reaction
No reaction

I don't really wanna know why you went there (why you went there)
I kinda don't care (kinda don't care)
You wanna kill me? (You wanna kill me)
You wanna hurt me? (Mmm)
Stop being flirty
It's kinda working
Did you really think this is the right thing to do?
(Is it news? News to who?)
That I really looked just like the rest of you

And everybody said it was a let-down
I was only built like everybody else now
But I didn't get a surgery to help out
'Cause I'm not about to redesign myself now, am I?
(Am I?) Am I?
All these other inanimate bitches
It's none of my business
But don't you get sick of posing for pictures with that plastic body?
Man...
