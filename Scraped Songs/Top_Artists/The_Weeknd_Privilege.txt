Enjoy your privileged life
'Cause I'm not gonna hold you through the night
We said our last goodbyes
So let's just try to end it with a smile
And I don't wanna hear that you are suffering
You are suffering, no more
'Cause I held you down when you were suffering
You were suffering
Blues away, way, way
I got two red pills to take the blues away
Blues away, way, way
I got two red pills to take the blues away
And I'ma fuck the pain away, and I know I'll be okay
They said our love is just a game, I don't care what they say
And I'ma drink pain away
I'll be back to my old ways
And I got two red pills to take the blues away (blues away), oh
(I don't wanna hear that you are suffering)
(You are suffering, no more)
(I don't wanna hear that you are suffering)
(No more)
(You are suffering, no more)
(I don't wanna hear that you are suffering) I don't wanna hear
(You are suffering, no more) no more, no
(I don't wanna hear that you are suffering)
(You are suffering)
(Oh-oh, yeah)
