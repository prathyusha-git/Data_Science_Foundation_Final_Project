I don't want it
And I don't want to want you
But in my dreams I seem to be more honest
And I must admit, you've been in quite a few
Halley's Comet
Comes around more than I do
But you're all it takes for me to break a promise
Silly me to fall in love with you
I haven't slept since Sunday
Midnight for me is 3:00 a.m. for you
But my sleepless nights are better
With you than nights could ever be alone, ooh-ooh-ooh
I was good at feeling nothing, now I'm hopeless
What a drag to love you like I do, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
I've been loved before, but right now in this moment
I feel more and more like I was made for you
♪
For you
♪
I'm sitting in my brother's room
♪
Haven't slept in a week or two, or two
I think I might have fallen in love
What am I to do?
