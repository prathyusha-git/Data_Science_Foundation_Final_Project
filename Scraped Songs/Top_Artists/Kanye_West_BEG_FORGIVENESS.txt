You've gone too far
You've gone too far, and you should hang your head in shame
For these wounds, I cannot stay, you've gone too far
You've gone too far
Wide awake and I can't hear my heartbeat
Hope it cradles me and rocks my heart to sleep
Protector in the light and a stranger in the dark, you don't say anything more
Bound by suffocatin' secrets, I must keep
You've gone too far
You've gone too far, and you should hang your head in shame
For these wounds, I cannot stay, you've gone too far
You've gone too far
Sum of all the parts that you have taken
Are a fraction of the parts that make me whole
For he was stronger than I was, but it's strength you can't sustain
Do not come to give me counsel, you should beg forgiveness of me
You should beg forgiveness
You should beg forgiveness
You should beg forgiveness
You should beg forgiveness of me

Don't let your moment pass you by
Don't let your moment pass you by
Had to go in my whole life
A hunnid percent covered in ice
Put down your phone, cut off the lights, lights
Cut off the lights, covered in ice
And if I go tonight, know that I lived a lovely life
Just make sure my kids are right and it is alright
And if I go tonight, just know I lived a lovely life
Tell my kids to live they life how they wanna live they life
