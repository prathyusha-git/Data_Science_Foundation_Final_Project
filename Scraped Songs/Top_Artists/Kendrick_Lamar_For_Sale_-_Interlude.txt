What's wrong, nigga?
I thought you was keepin' it gangsta
I thought this what you wanted
They say if you scared, go to church
But remember, he knows the Bible too
Now baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smokin', lokin', pokin' the deja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I (want you)
Now baby, when I'm ridin' here, I'm ridin' dirty
Registration is outta service
Smoking, lokin', drinkin' the potion, you can see me swerving
'Cause I (want you)
(I want you more than you know)
I remember you took me to the mall last week, baby
You looked me in my eyes about four or five times
'Til I was hypnotized, then you clarified that I (want you)
You said, "Sherane ain't got nothin' on Lucy"
I said, "You crazy"
Roses are red, violets are blue
But me and you both pushin' up daisies if I (want you)
Now baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smokin', lokin', pokin' the deja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I (want you)
You said to me
You said your name was Lucy, I said, "Where's Ricardo?"
You said, "Oh no, not the show!"
Then you spit a little rap to me like this
When I turned 26 I was like "Oh, shit!"
You said to me, I remember what you said too, you said
"My name is Lucy, Kendrick, you introduced me, Kendrick
Usually I don't do this, but I see you and me, Kendrick
Lucy give you no worries, Lucy got million stories
About these rappers that I came after when they was boring
Lucy gon' fill your pockets
Lucy gon' move your mama out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty, avoiding me?
It's not so easy, I'm at these functions accordingly
Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute, Lucy work harder
Lucy gon' call you even when Lucy know you love your father
I'm Lucy, I loosely heard prayers on your first album truly
Lucy don't mind 'cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy upfront
Lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork
I want you to know that Lucy got you
All your life I watched you
And now you all grown up to sign this contract, if that's possible"
Get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smokin', lokin', pokin' the deja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I (want you)
Now baby, when I'm ridin' here, I'm ridin' dirty

I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers
Until I came home
