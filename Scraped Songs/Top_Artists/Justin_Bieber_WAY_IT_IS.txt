I'm dreaming
I'm reaching and
Pulling you closer
To settle down
I'm dreaming of a place where we can go
Where the time isn't stolen
And there's nobody around
Let's keep it dreaming
And it won't die
Every day I lay my life down
I need you by my side
Everyday I count my blessings
You been on my mind
♪
That's just the way it is
Now we can
Settle down
Settle down
No more drama no reason to complicate it
We can settle down
That's just the way it is
Now we can
Settle down
Settle down
So more drama no reason to complicate it
We can settle down

Ain't thinkin' 'bout all of the things make it complicated
I brought you peony flowers 'cause you exotic baby
I need more doses of your love, I'm intoxicated
I love the way it feel
Dreaming of travelin' places we've never seen
Seeing you carry my child with a diamond ring
Hope we can settle down start a family
That's just the way it is
I custom Yves Saint Laurent
I got you Hermes the croc
'cause it's whatever for you
Tell me whatever you want
I'll do whatever for you
Get anything, what you want?
'cause it's whatever for you
Vintage Chanel for the clutch
Put Hoorsenbuhs on her right
Know what i do turn her up
She want the new Bentley truck
You get your bang for your buck
I'll get whatever for you
Ain't no one else, it's just us
And it's whatever for you
That's just the way it is
Now we can
Settle down
Settle down
No more drama no reason to complicate it
We can settle down
That's just the way it is
Now we can
Settle down
Settle down
No more drama no reason to complicate it
We can settle down
Want you
