It's 5 AM my time again
I'm soakin' up the moon, can't sleep
It's 5 AM my time again
I'm calling and you know it's me
I'm pushin' myself further
I'm just tryin' to feel my heartbeat beat
I wrap my hands around your neck
You love it when I always squeeze
It's 5 AM, I'm high again
And you can see that I'm in pain
I've fallen into emptiness
I want you 'cause we're both insane
I'm staring into the abyss
I'm lookin' at myself again
♪
I'm dozing off to R.E.M
I'm trying not to lose my faith
And I love it when you watch me sleep
You spin me 'round so I can breathe
It's only safe for you and me
I know you won't let me OD
And if I finally die in peace
Just wrap my body in these sheets
And pour out the gasoline
It don't mean much to me
Around, around, around, around we go
In this game called life, we are not free
♪
Oh, yeah
(And I love it when you watch me sleep)
You spin me 'round so I can breathe
It's only safe for you and me, don't let me go
(I know you won't let me OD) Don't you let me go
(And if I finally die in peace) Oh
(Just wrap my body in these sheets) Oh-oh
And pour out the gasoline
It don't mean much to me
