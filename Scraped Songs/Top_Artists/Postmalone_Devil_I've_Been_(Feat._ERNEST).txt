She tried to hide them wings under that Double RL
Well she might be an angel that's what I'm tellin' myself
And she knows I'm a demon, she heard bout all my songs
Saint Hank up on the wall, that man done
Seen it all
Thank God there's still salvation
For a guy like me who still needs savin'
So I hung my horns on the wall soon as she walked in
Been in here gettin' half gone with all my hell-bound friends
Yeah I'm about tired of livin' this life of sin
Girl I'm one hell of a night
Yeah but I ain't the devil I've been
Ain't the devil, ain't the devil
Ain't the devil I've been
Ain't the devil, ain't the devil
I've been around the world twice
One foot from six feet deep
I got some burns from a flame I thought could never get me
And wouldn't you know
She fell right through the roof of the bar where I met
Yeah and pulled up a stool
Thank God there's still salvation
For a guy like me who still needs savin'
So I hung my horns on the wall soon as she walked in
Been in here gettin' half gone with all my hell-bound friends
Yeah I'm about tired of livin' this life of sin
Girl I'm one hell of a night
Yeah but I ain't the devil I've been
Ain't the devil, ain't the devil
Ain't the devil I've been
Ain't the devil, ain't the devil
Oh, I ain't the flame I used to be
Yeah it's funny how a cage can make a man feel so free
So I hung my horns on the wall soon as she walked in
Been in here gettin' half gone with all my hell-bound friends
Yeah I'm about tired of livin' this life of sin
Girl I'm one hell of a night
Yeah but I ain't the devil I've been
Ain't the devil, ain't the devil
Ain't the devil I've been
Ain't the devil, ain't the devil
Ain't the devil I've been
Ain't the devil, ain't the devil
Ain't the devil I've been
Ain't the devil, ain't the devil
Ain't the devil I've been
