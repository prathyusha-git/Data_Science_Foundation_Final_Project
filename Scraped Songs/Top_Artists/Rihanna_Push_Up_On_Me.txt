We break, break
We break, break
We break, break
We're breaking down
We break, break
We break, break
We break, break
We're breaking down
It's getting later baby, and I'm getting curious
Nobody's looking at us, I feel delirious
'Cause the beat penetrates my body
Shaking inside my bones
And you pushin' all my buttons, taking me out of my zone, yeah
The way that you stare, starts a fire in me
Come up to my room, my sexy little thing
And let's play a game, I won't be a tease
I'll show you the boom, my sexy little thing
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would light me up and say you want me, push up on me
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would light me up and say you want me, push up on me
I know many guys just like ya, extremely confident
Got so much flavour with you, like you're the perfect man
You wanna make me chase ya, like it's a compliment
But let's get right down to it
I can be the girl that'll break you down
The way that you stare, starts a fire in me
Come up to my room, you sexy little thing
And let's play a game, I won't be a tease
I'll show you the boom, my sexy little thing
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would light me up and say you want me, push up on me
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would light me up and say you want me, push up on me
We break, break
We break, break
We break, break
We're breaking down
We break, break
We break, break
We break, break
We're breaking down
I wanna see how you move it
Show me, show me how you do it
You really got me on it, I must confess (I must confess)
Baby there ain't nothing to it
Baby, who you think you're fooling?
You wanna come and get me outta my dress, oh...
The way that you stare, starts a fire in me (the way you stare at me)
Come up to my room, you sexy little thing (sexy little thing)
And let's play a game (yeah), I won't be a tease (oh, baby)
I'll show you the boom, my sexy little thing (oh, oh, oh)
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would light me up and say you want me, push up on me
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would light me up and say you want me, push up on me
We break, break
We break, break
We break, break
We're breaking down
We break, break
We break, break
We break, break
We're breaking down
