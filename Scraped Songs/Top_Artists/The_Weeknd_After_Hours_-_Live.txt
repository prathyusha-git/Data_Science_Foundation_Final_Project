Ooh, baby
I'm fallin' in too deep, oh, no
I'm fallin' in too deep, oh, baby
I'm fallin' in too deep, oh, so
♪
My darkest hours
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
Different girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you
I turned into the man I used to be, to be
Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
I just wanted to call you and say, and say
Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
Never comin' down
I was running away from facin' reality
Wastin' all of my time out living my fantasies
Spendin' money to compensate, compensate
'Cause I want you, baby
I be livin' in heaven when I'm inside of you
It was simply a blessing wakin' beside you
I'll never let you down again, again
Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, yeah
♪
I know it's all my fault
Made you put down your guard
And I know I made you fall
Then said you were wrong for me
But I lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you
Can't hide the truth, I'd stay with her in spite of you
You did some things that you regret, still ride for you
'Cause this house is not a home
Without my (baby)
