Try it if it feels right (try it)
Try it if it feels right, yeah
When you try, oh, oh
♪
I'm tryin'
I'm just, yeah, I'm just, yeah
I been out here tryin' to see my homecoming
And of course, somebody's always gonna say something
Try and shoot me down for voicin' my own opinion
Triggerin' a part of me that's always been indifferent
And I know that we have asked for change
Don't be scared to put the fears to shame
When you know what you got, sacrifice ain't that hard
Feel like dependin' on me, sometimes we ain't meant to be free
When you know what you got, sacrifice ain't that hard
Feel like dependin' on me, sometimes we ain't meant to be free
Open up this letter you ain't tryin' to read
You've been blind to the subject but not blind to me
And I know that this margin ain't too small for me
Not too real, not too much anymore, not enough
And I know that we have asked for change
Don't be scared to put the fears to shame
When you know what you got, sacrifice ain't that hard
Feel like dependin' on me, sometimes we ain't meant to be free
When you know what you got, sacrifice ain't that hard
Feel like dependin' on me, sometimes we ain't meant to be free
If who I am offends you, don't feel sorry
Don't feel, don't feel sorry, don't feel, don't feel sorry
My loss is worth more than your wins
I'm satisfied if it starts over again
That is everything, that is everything, that is everything
That is everything, that is everything
I try to make it stop, I pray it will stop
I try to make it stop, I pray it will stop
I, stop, I am what you not
I try to make it stop, I pray it will stop
I try to make it stop, I pray it will stop
I try to make it stop, I pray it will stop
I, stop, I am what you not
I try to make it stop, I pray it will stop
