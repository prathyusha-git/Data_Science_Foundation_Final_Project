Eye candy, eye candy
Eye candy, eye candy
Ooh, the first one's free, the second'll cost you (uh, yeah)
And if you look too close, you'll lose your mind
And I know that there's somebody's daughter, oh, you know I do
Nights like this don't happen all the time
Way that this is going, it just feels so right, oh, yes, it does
So, baby, let's get focused, just enjoy the moment
And I'll keep looking on and on, and on, and on, on (eye candy)
Eye candy
'Cause you taste so sweet, uh, when you're looking at me, uh
Baby, I wanna know why can't we eye candy?
Just a little bit closer and a little bit longer
I'm looking at you, eye candy, eye candy
Can you look me in the eyes, candy?
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder (yeah)
So I'ma hold you, baby
You can't let a sweet thing pass you by (you by, mm)
You could spread your wings and, uh, open up
You know what I'm saying, baby?
'Cause nights like this don't happen all the time, uh (oh, oh)
Way that this is going
It just feels so right (right), oh, yes, it does (oh, yes, it does)
Baby, let's keep focused, just enjoy the moment
And I'll keep looking on and on, and on, and on, on (eye candy)
Eye candy
'Cause you taste so sweet, uh, when you're looking at me, uh
Baby, I wanna know, why can't we eye candy?
Just a little bit closer and a little bit longer (just a little bit)
I'm looking at you, eye candy, eye candy
'Cause it tastes so sweet, uh, when you're looking at me, uh
Baby, I wanna know, why can't we eye candy?
Just a little bit closer and a little bit longer
I might need another piece
Eye candy, eye candy
Can you look me in the eyes, candy?
Oh, oh
Oh, ooh
Baby, I wanna know, know, eye candy
