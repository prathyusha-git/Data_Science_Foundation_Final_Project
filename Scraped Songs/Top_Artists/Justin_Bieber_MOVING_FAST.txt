I was speeding towards the wall, I was 25
Closed eyes, looking for a light, 100 miles riding
Got too close to the fire, should've come with a warning sign
I guess you get red, uh
Running from it all, turn away from another memory
Seen it all ending
Sick of speeding though
Thinking you could make a better man of me, bet it all now
Now I roll the windows down, and I'm slowing it down for you
Now I roll the windows down, and I'm slowing it down for you
Now I roll the windows down, and I'm slowing it down for you
Now I roll the windows down, and I'm slowing it down for you, you, you
Uh, just 200 on the dash, I was moving too, moving too fast
You know I was, uh
It was you and me since day one, day one, day one
Oh-oh-oh, ah-ah
Now I roll the windows down, and I'm slowing it down for you
Now I roll the windows down, and I'm slowing it down for you
Now I roll the windows down, and I'm slowing it down for you
Now I roll the windows down, and I'm slowing it down for you, you, you
