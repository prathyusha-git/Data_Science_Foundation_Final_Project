It's getting late
Why you gotta be beside me?
Watching, needing, wanting me?
I'm afraid, don't be
I'm afraid, don't be
I'm afraid, don't be
I'm afraid, don't be
I'm afraid
Don't be, don't...

I know it's getting late, and I'm struggling to let go
Although there's distance between us, there's no place I'd rather be
I owe you some hospitality, and it comes so naturally
Promise, I just need some more time
If you can bear with me
When last did we feel this close together?
Chasing sunsets in California
Don't make me wait, babe, it's been forever
Don't take forever
It's been forever
Don't take forever
It's been forever

Trust me, I'm starting to realize
And look beyond my fears
Sun keeps on turning to twilight
Baby, we don't have long
I can't keep my hands off you
All night, all my love
You say it's getting too late
Baby, don't be afraid
When last did we feel this close together?
Chasing sunsets in California
Don't make me wait, babe, it's been forever
Don't take forever
It's been forever
Don't take forever
It's been forever
Giddy up, girl, best I can do
Go follow where the wind blows, mmm
Sometimes, we all feel hollow
My heart, girl, you can borrow, mmm
