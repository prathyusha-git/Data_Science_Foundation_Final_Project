It's a long way up from rock bottom
There's been times I felt I could fall further
I have loved and lost and feared and prayed
But now the day bursts wild and open
I have cried tears at my brother's grave
I have shaken hands with my wife's surgeon
I spent weeks inside the darkest cage
But now the day bursts wild and open
There's a time to cry, there's a time to fold
There's a time for holdin' on and to let it go
There's a time to run to the arms of hope
And the day bursts wild and open
I was raised by the church, choir boy, still far from fizzlin'
Not the popstar they say they prefer, kept quiet, but I came to be heard
Been a long time up top, but I ain't complacent, if I look down, I can see replacements
Late-night drive with my heartbeat racin', gotta make dreams and chase 'em
Taken my fair share of that ridicule, but the words are not applicable
Catalogue formidable, me and that guy are in a different place
Undefeated, but that's temptin' fate, two of them tried it, I won both cases
Won't get back all the time they wasted, I am not losin' sleep
In this world, there's no relaxin', I've been here since migraine skankin'
Never been cool, but never been a has-been, I'd kip on your couch if you knew me back then
Don't tell 'em bout the walls you're trapped in, gotta keep this Usain pace
Don't ask me how I got this break, I built my own bricks through constant playin'
SB died, couldn't stop this pain, I look at the dots in space
I wonder if he's proud or thinks that his best friend lost his way
Keep it together for my daughters, gotta come natural, I don't wanna force it
If it's not factual, don't support it, every year, gotta re-swim these waters
Draw a line, for the sake of all your family and friends
Draw a line, so history doesn't happen again
Draw a line, for the day to start the night has to end
Draw a line, for all of these ghosts
I'm too high to fly this plane, too fucked to drive this Range
Can't remember the last time I was on my own without Kev, it's kinda strange
Not been the same since 19, now to push Ly on a swing, I gotta wear disguises
I'm up for tradin' life sometimes, and that may surprise 'em
Every stadium, I played it, but I would still do it for free
Gotta keep standards, top of the top of the tree, press still got problems with me
And when school starts, I might peace out, 'til then I keep chasin' the dream
I could end it, but I don't wanna reach out 'cause he means nothin' to me
Don't worry 'bout what I make, don't trip them up to win this race
When your career's in a risky place, everything seems like a big mistake
I'm still lookin' for shit to say, deludin' myself that they still relate
Depression, I keep at bay, tomorrow's a different day
Me and that guy don't speak no more, I know why, but he's not sure, so what is the reason for
My heart's been broke so many times by loved ones that I don't ever feel like talkin'
So heed that warning, circle keeps gettin' smaller
All I need is Chez and my daughters and a few friends to help me
Draw a line, for the sake of your little girls and their time
Draw a line, but allow yourself some moments to cry
Draw a line, and leave the past that hurt you behind
Draw a line, for all of these ghosts
Draw a line, be grateful that you've been where you've been
Draw a line, recognise the path that happened between
Draw a line, there's future here, that's yet to be seen
Draw a line
And the day bursts wild and open
