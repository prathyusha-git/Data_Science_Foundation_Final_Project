Flowers in our garden are dying
When did the water run dry?
Who can tell?
But you want the truth, we're not fine
We don't need space, we need time
It's just fight, then leave and work for the day
Come back and pretend that all is okay
Then when morning comes, we repeat that again
And again and again and again
We got problems
And we don't know how to solve them
It gets worse when we're not talking
Give me all of you, I'll give you all of me
We got problems
Bigger problems than our mothers
And our fathers had before us
Give me all of you, I'll give you all of me
We got problems
We got problems
We got problems
We got problems
I can't understand right now, every single moment
We just go from bad to worse to temperature exploding
I know that it builds when littler things get held in
When our friends ask, "What is the matter?"
I have no idea what to tell them
It's just fight, then leave and work for the day
Come back and pretend that all is okay
Then when morning comes, we repeat that again
And again and again and again
We got problems
And we don't know how to solve them
It gets worse when we're not talking
Give me all of you, I'll give you all of me
We got problems
Bigger problems than our mothers
And our fathers had before us
Give me all of you, I'll give you all of me
We got problems
We got problems
We got problems
We got problems
We got problems
We got problems
We got problems
