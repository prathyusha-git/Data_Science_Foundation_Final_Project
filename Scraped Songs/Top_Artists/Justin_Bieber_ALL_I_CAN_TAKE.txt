And it's all I can take
And it's all I can take
And it's all I can take
And it's all I can take
These symptoms of my sensitivity
♪
Feels personal when no one's listening
♪
There's things that I can't change, lord knows I've tried
♪
Oh, baby, we can leave it all tonight
♪
Ooh, baby don't it feel good baby don't it feel nice

Ooh, baby, don't it feel good you don't have to think twice (lean back and rock away)
And it's all I can take (in this moment)
And it's all I can take (keep it goin')
And it's all I can take (in this moment)
And it's all I can take (and rock away)
Good time tonight, keep it rolling
Baby let's enjoy moment
So we going 'til 4 in the morning
I got a gift a know it, I'll cherish it and hold it
There's a reason, there's a reason for all this
Ooh, baby don't it feel good baby don't it feel nice
Weight up on my shoulders and my hands up high
Oh (lean back and rock away)
And it's all I can take (in this moment)
And it's all I can take (keep it goin')
And it's all I can take (in this moment)
And it's all I can take (and rock away)
