It is opening day and a brand-new start
The stones have been cleared around the fishermen's hut
And the air bites, then leaves almost invisible cuts
On the skin
A lighthouse retired, but a new one was hired
About 20 foot taller, painted in black and white
Twenty million steps with a computer inside
Instead of him
Only one road sign
Tellin' cars to slow down
And a long drop in the ocean
Beware of the rip tide
Broken glass and train lines
It's a new day and this is England
Next to the pub with the flag that's workin' flexible hours
'Cause there's a mismatch of carriages, soil in a boat for some flowers
Fairy lights on a building that's supplyin' us power
From the sea
Electricity lines flow like veins to the town
In-between, there is nothin' but grass and pebbles on the ground
Do not enter the wild here if you want to be found
For the free
View the flame of sunrise
Cut in half by the sky
And the empty of the desert
Team of birds that swerve by
And then land on the wire
It's a new day and this is England
When it's time to escape from the heavy of this
There is nothin' like washin' away
I find this country of mine gets a bad reputation
Of bein' cold and grey
But on the coast of the south, to the east followed 'round
I find serenity I've never felt
There's a peace and a quiet in this island of ours
That can't be mirrored by anywhere else
Homes protruding from stones with their wood coloured black
Scattered cars in a line, steam risin' out the shack
One door at the front and then just glass out the back
For the view
And the blue is so bright
You'll need shades for your eyes
And a cable to pull over
Take a walk and feel like
Everything will be fine
It's a new day and this is England
