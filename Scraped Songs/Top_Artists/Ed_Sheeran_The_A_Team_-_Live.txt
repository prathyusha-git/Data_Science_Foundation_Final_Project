White lips, pale face, breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end, struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men
And they say she's in the Class A Team
She is stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
'Cause she's just under the upperhand
And goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside tonight
'Cause in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
For angels to fly
Rips gloves, raincoat, tried to swim, stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes, weary-eyed, dry throat
Cool girl, no phone
And they say she's in the Class A Team
She's tuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
'Cause she's just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple grams
But she don't wanna go outside tonight
'Cause in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Sells love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
An angel will die, covered in white
Closed eyes and hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line
Straight down the line
