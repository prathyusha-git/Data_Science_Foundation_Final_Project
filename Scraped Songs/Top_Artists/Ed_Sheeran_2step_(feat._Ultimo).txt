I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break, something's got to change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lucid conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then we'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turnin' up and when I'm on your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low, then up, alone and loved
And all we need is us to go all
Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us
Quando mi dai poco voglio troppo da te però
Quando mi dai troppo non capisco cos'è
Vorrei sparire di botto, come la pioggia ad agosto
Poi dimostrarti che torno, in fondo l'amore è ritorno però
Siediti che ti racconto
Come si può nella vita stare in piedi
Senza che nessuno paghi per te il conto
Ed esser oggi quello che tu sognavi ieri
Come ho fatto a non vederlo nei miei occhi
Che ho già dentro quel che io cercavo fuori
Dai, sarà che c'ho il destino in tasca
E lo decido io se un giorno questo cambia
We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turnin' up and when I'm on your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low, then up, alone and loved
And all we need is us to go all (night)
Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night
Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night
