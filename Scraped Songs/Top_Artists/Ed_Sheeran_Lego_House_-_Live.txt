This is Lego House
Sing
I'm gonna pick up the pieces and build a Lego house
If things go wrong, we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
There's one thing on my mind, it's all for you
And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken, I will mend you
And I'll keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now, now
I'm gonna paint you by numbers and color you in
And if things go right, we can frame it and put you on a wall now
And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before
Now I surrender up my heart and swap it for yours
Now I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
Don't hold me down now
I think my braces are breaking
And it's more than I can take, oh
And it's a dark and cold December
But I've got ya to keep me warm
If you're broken, I'll mend you
And I'll keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now
Gonna sing it out loud
Come on The Roundhouse, make some noise, say 'yeah'
Scream it out, scream it out
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
(I'll pick you up when you're getting down)
(And out of all these things I've done)
(I think I love you better now)
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time, get funky
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now, now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I will love you better now
Thank you very much
