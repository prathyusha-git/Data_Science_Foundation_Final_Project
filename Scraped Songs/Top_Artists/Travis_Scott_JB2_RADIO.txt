You're now listenin' to KJB2 (JACKBOYS)
Stay tuned for more (you must see it to believe it)
Talmbout Screw and candy paint, swangers and drank
It's, you, you know I'm sayin'? (Yeah, yeah)
And we tellin' them, "This is where it's goin'" (mhm)
Like, this is, this is what's happenin', we're, we're the next city to blow
We got the lifestyle, the night scene, we got everybody, everything
And this is the album that will explain it to people (yeah)
