Lord forgive me
Kill him where he stand and stand over him
Shake his hand, then jump back in that minivan
Double back to his block and blam
I ain't backin' down for nothin'
I'ma back 'em down like Shaq
With this black 2-2-3 in my hand
Better pray that this chopper jam like a radio single, man
Police radio signals sayin' that a 187 land on yo' corner
Coroners comfort yo' momma
"Momma, he's dead," the next mornin'
I toasted up with my homies
We drink and smoke marijuana
Want us to change our ways? Uh-huh
You see this game we play come from
Uncles that raised me in Compton
Ask me what I have accomplished
I don't know, I don't have conscience
I just load up and start dumpin' on enemies
I'm headhuntin', no sympathy
Ain't no love when you in these streets
Just get somethin', protect yo' neck
'Cause they comin' for sets, respect
Split your onion, then chop yo' deck
Your head tumblin' like gymnastics (ooh...)
'Cause ignorance is bliss
Now everybody put yo' hands up high
If you don't give a fuck, put yo' hands up high
This the hardest shit you've heard from L.A. this far
And I'm this far from a discharge, but never will I diss y'all
We all tryna ball, and when I got the rock, I'll dish off
Until the day I pistol-whip you posers 'til y'all pissed off
Then peel off in a hoopty
Come back and make these niggas wanna shoot me
And they bitches wanna salute me or seduce me
Indubitably, I'm too street, indubitably, I'ma do me
Better than yo' bitch would, 'cause you niggas too weak
But just give me two weeks and I'm good
I'll make an album that'll put a smile on Malcolm
Make Martin Luther tell God I'm the future for Heaven's talent
No tarot card readin', I'm foreseein' you niggas vanish
Not only from the rap game, I'm includin' the planet
Cats so watered-down, clowns can sink Titanic
Tie titanium around they neck and watch 'em panic
Gimme respect, dammit, or get damaged
Die young, corpse identified by your parents
Apparently, you're a parrot, mockin' me and my blueprint
But I won't share it, just make you cop it, then call you a sheriff
Stop it, I'm hearin' the comments
The critics are callin' me conscious
But truthfully, every shooter be callin' me Compton
So truthfully, only callin' me Kweli and Common?
Proves, that ignorance is bliss
Now everybody put yo' hands up high
If you don't give a fuck, put yo' hands up high
And this still the hardest shit you've heard from L.A. this far
And I'm this far, from a discharge, but never will I diss y'all
This my world, I grab the universe then play kickball
And they wonder why these California earthquakes hittin' so hard
I'm So-Cal, you so-called rappers need to go call Ghostbusters
'Cause you busters are Casper when I go off
I show up to show out and show off
You a hundred percent behind me
And if you are, then wreck yo' car
And walk up to my crime scene
I remember bein' 17, wishin' someone would sign me
Now the only way these labels get me back is when they rewind me
Backin' down bargains, backin' down bitches
We gon' flip her
Once she off that blue dolphin, you gon' tip her
'Cause ignorance is bliss

And Willie B, I'm a fool on yo' beats
