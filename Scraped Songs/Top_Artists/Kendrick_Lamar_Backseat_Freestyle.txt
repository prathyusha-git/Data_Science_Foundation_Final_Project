Uh, Martin had a dream
Martin had a dream
Kendrick have a dream
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So, I can fuck the world for 72 hours
Goddamn, I feel amazing, damn, I'm in the matrix
My mind is livin' on cloud nine and this nine is never on vacation
Sound of that Maserati and vroom-vroom, I'm racin'
Poppin' pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
And I pray you niggas is hatin', shooters go after Judas
Jesus Christ, if I live life on my knees, ain't no need to do this
Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken
All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winners, screamin'
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So, I can fuck the world for 72 hours
Goddamn, I got bitches (okay), damn, I got bitches (okay)
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I got 25 lighters on my dresser, yes sir
Put fire to that ass, body cast on a stretcher
And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
And it make me cum fast but I never get embarrassed
And I recognize you have what I've been wantin' since that record
That Adina Howard, had pop it fast to impress her
She rollin', I'm holdin' my scrotum and posin'
This voice here is golden, so fuck y'all, I goes in and
All my life I want money and power (whoa-oh)
Respect my mind or die from lead shower (whoa-oh)
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower (whoa-oh)
So, I can fuck the world for 72 hours (oh)
Goddamn, I got bitches, damn, I got bitches
Damn, I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or nigga, it's go time
I roll in dough with a good grind
And I run at hoe, with a baton
That's a relay race with a bouquet
They say "K, you gon' marry mines"
Biatch, no way, biatch, no way, biatch, no way, biatch, okay
I'm never livin' life confined, I still feel ya even if I'm blind (whoa)
I can tell ya who, what, when, where, how to sell your game right on time (whoa)
Biatch, go play, biatch, go play, biatch, go play (whoa)
Biatch, I look like OJ, killin' everything from pussy to a motherfuckin' Hit-Boy beat
She pussy poppin' and I got options like an Audible, I be
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, I win, then ball at your defeat
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, my city, mobbin' in the street, yellin'
A-a-all my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So, I can fuck the world for 72 hours
Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn, I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
Let it run, Ali
