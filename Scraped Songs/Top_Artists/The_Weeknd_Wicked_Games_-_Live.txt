Bring your love, baby, I could bring my shame
Bring the drugs, baby, I could bring my pain
I got my heart right here
I got my scars right here
Bring the cups, baby, I could bring the drank
Bring your body, baby, I could bring you fame
And that's my motherfucking words too
Just let me motherfucking love you
Listen, ma, I'll give you all I got
Get me off of this, I need confidence in myself
♪
Ohh, listen, ma, I'll give you all of me
Give me all of it, I need all of it to myself baby, to myself, baby, I know
So tell me you love me
I wanna know, Los Angeles, do you motherfucking love me, baby?
♪
Just tell me love me
Oh Los Angeles, do you love me?
Oh LA, do you love me?
Oh West Side, do you love me?
Oh baby
So tell me you love me!
