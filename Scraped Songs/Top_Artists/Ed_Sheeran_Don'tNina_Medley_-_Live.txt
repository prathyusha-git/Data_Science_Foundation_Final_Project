I met this girl late last year
She said, "Don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her, "I'm not really looking for another mistake"
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin'
(Ah, la, uhm, lala) Don't ... with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
(Ah, la, uhm, lala) Don't ... with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
Ah, la, uhm, lala
And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's stayin' at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missin' it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissin' him, how I was confused about
Now, she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing
(Ah, la, uhm, lala) Don't ... with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
(Ah, la, uhm, lala) Don't ... with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
Ah, la, uhm, lala
On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was cryin' on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
(We were stayin' on the same ... hotel floor)
And I wasn't lookin' for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singin'
(Ah, la, uhm, lala) Don't ... with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe

I met you when I was a teen, but then, you were one as well
And I could play a guitar just like ringin' a bell
Sometimes I wonder, in any other summer
Could you have been my part-time lover to me listenin' to Stevie Wonder?
Under the covers where we used to lay
And "Re: Stacks" is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watchin' a DVD, smokin' illegal weed
Gettin' high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We'd go anywhere our minds would take us
And I'd say, "You are beautiful without your makeup
And you don't even need to worry 'bout your weight
'Cause we can all be loved the way that God made us"
And time's the only reason that we could break up
'Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes
To get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again
Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina
'Cause I ain't ever comin' home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now? (Ah, la, uhm, lala)
And I've been livin' on the road, Nina
But then again, you should know, Nina
'Cause that's you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?
