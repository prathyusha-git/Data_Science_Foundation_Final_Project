Yo, man, let me take that one from the top (you're not gettin' it, it's not clockin' to you)
It's not clockin' to you that I'm standin' on business, is it? (We're on the sidewalk, Justin)
I don't give a f- if you're on the sidewalk
I'm a human - bein', you're standin' around my car, at the beach, you know I'm sayin'?
I like that you pronounce business
Usually, when I say, "Standin' on bidness," I say, "Standin' on bidness" (mm)
I don't say, "Standing on, I'm standing on business, bro"
I think that's why he ain't leave right there
You were pronunciatin' every word, you can't pronunciate every word when you doin' that (damn)
Nam sayin'? "I'm standin' on bidness" (yeah, you right)
And you standin' on bidness (yeah, you're right, you're right)
Yeah, that guy'll never leave, y'know? (So)
I'ma start goin' to beach and lookin' for motherfuckers just to say that shit too
You want some of this black? You wanna hit this, uh, Black & Mild? (Nah, I'm good, I'm cool, bro)
You good? (Yeah) aight, bet, no, I figured that
