We've been lost for a long time
In a rut, no escape signs
And for love, we were so blind
Oh, I hate to see you cry
There've been times where the truth lied
Now, it's clear as a blue sky
Like a Band-Aid over deeper cuts, we tried
We couldn't stop the fate descending on the night
♪
We'll build a fire and torch our old lives
And hope the spark survives
Use words as kindling
Light up the night sky
Let the memories take flight
And hope the spark survives
Yeah, we hope the spark survives
♪
Oh, I wonder, will we pull through?
All we ever do is argue
With not a lot, but we make do
How I wish you wouldn't say that
There are things you can't take back
When you leave, I always face facts
Like a hand that's trying to hold the water back
We couldn't stop the ocean leaking in the cracks
♪
We'll build a fire and torch our old lives
And hope the spark survives
Use words as kindling
Light up the night sky
Let the memories take flight
And hope the spark survives
Yeah, we hope the spark survives
♪
We've taken roads (oh, we've taken roads)
That led to confusion
But right now, that don't matter at all (nah, nah)
We'll bring it back (yeah, we'll bring it back)
Our love's no illusion
The higher we go, the harder we fall, and now
We'll build a fire and torch our old lives
And hope the spark survives
Use words as kindling
Light up the night sky
Let the memories take flight
And hope the spark survives
Yeah, we hope the spark survives
And we hope the spark survives
