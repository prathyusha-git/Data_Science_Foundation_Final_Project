Every time I wake up next to you, I talk to God
And I'm so damn grateful
'Cause you make up for all the things I'm not
Didn't know I needed nothing, 'til I needed you ('til I needed you)
In a world that's spinnin', it ain't easy lettin' go
Eight billion people we just lookin' for a hand to hold
Everybody's tryna find someone to hold on to (hold on to)
It's okay, it's okay, we all try to pretend that we're brave
When I'm weak, yeah, I'm strong, 'cause of you at end of the day
Everybody needs somebody (everybody need somebody)
Somebody to remind you that you're not alone
Who gon' defend you like an army (defend you like an army)
And never let go (never let go)
Everybody needs somebody (everybody needs somebody)
Somebody to wake up to when everyone's gone
So if you need me, then you got me (if you need me, then you got me)
I'll be the shoulder you cry on
Everybody needs some-

Every time I look at you, I'm lookin' at a star
It's the way you light up every room just being who you are
Didn't know I needed nothing, 'til I needed you ('til I needed you, oh, woah)
But before I met you, I never believed in magic
But you stole my heart before anyone knew you had it
I know (yeah, yeah) that you know (yeah, yeah)
What we got, it don't come easy
It's okay, it's okay, we all try to pretend that we're brave
When I'm weak, yeah, I'm strong, 'cause of you at end of the day
