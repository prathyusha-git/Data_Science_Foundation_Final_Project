Azizam (get up, get up)
Meet me on the floor tonight (get up, get up, get up)
Show me how to move like the water (get up, get up)
In between the dancin' lights (get up)
Be mine (get up), be mine (get up)
Azizam
I wanna be nowhere but here with you now
I wanna be one in the space
I wanna be tangled and wrapped in your cloud
I wanna be close to your face
Well, tomorrow can wait, losin' time in this place
'Til the sun is awake, be like a magnet on me
I don't care what they say, we can do it our way
And if love's just a game, then come and play

I wanna get lost in your ocean and drown
I wanna be careless and free
I wanna live here in the moment we found
I wanna be all that you see
Well, tomorrow can wait, losin' time in this place
'Til the sun is awake, be like a magnet on me
I don't care what they say, we can do it our way
And if love's just a game, then come and play
