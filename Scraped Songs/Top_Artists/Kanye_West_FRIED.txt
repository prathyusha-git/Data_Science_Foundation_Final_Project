Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa
I done had too many friends that died
Sometimes, I can't believe I'm still alive
She told you I ain't had it, but she lied
Boy, don't play with me, you know I'm fried
Boy, don't play with me, you know I'm fried
She givin' blowjobs and I applied
She said she starvin', order her some fries
Then I ate the breast, then the thighs
Then I gave the rest to the guys
You was typin' crazy, out your mind
This is not a typo, we reply
Now you spillin' Type-O, out your side
Boy, don't play with me, you know I'm-
Boy, don't play with me, you know I'm fried
Pray on our enemies when we dine
We just hope the feds take a bribe
Only one gon' walk away when we collide
20 dollars, now that's fuckin' mine
Ten bitches came with Dolla, they all dimes

They all starvin', order them some fries
Then I lick the breast, then the thighs
Bitch, don't play with me, you know I'm-

Boy, don't play with me, you know I'm fried
Ooh, swervin' in the Lamb' off the lot
Five percent the tint with no top
They love me in my city like I'm Pac
Remember when we used to window-shop?
Now, I just whipped the Porsche to the mosque
Ye copped me the chain with the cross
Had to throw some hundos in the wash
Baby, take a seat and take it off
So much ice on me, I can't defrost
Where them that was sayin' I fell off?
Boy, don't play with me, you know I-
Boy, don't play with me, you know I'm fried
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
