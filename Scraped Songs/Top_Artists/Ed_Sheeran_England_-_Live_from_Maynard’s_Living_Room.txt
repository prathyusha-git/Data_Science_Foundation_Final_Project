It is opening day, and a brand-new start
The stones have been cleared around the fishermen's hut
And the air bites, then leaves, almost invisible cuts on the skin
A lighthouse retired, but a new one was hired
About 20 foots taller, painted in black and white
20 million steps with a computer inside instead of him
Only one road sign tellin' cars to slow down
And a long drop in the ocean
Beware of the riptide, broken glass and train lines
It's a new day, and this is England
Next to the pub with the flag that's workin' flexible hours
There's a mismatch of carriages soil in a boat for some flowers
Fairy lights on a building that's supplyin' us power from the sea
Electricity lines flow like veins to the town
In-between, there is nothin' but grass and pebbles on the ground
Do not enter the wild here if you want to be found for the free
View the flame of sunrise, cut in half by the sky
And the empty of the desert
Team of birds that swerve by, and then land on the wire
It's a new day, and this is England
When it's time to escape from the heavy of this
There is nothin' like washin' away
I find this country of mine gets a bad reputation
Of bein' cold and gray
From the Coast of the South to the East followed 'round
I find serenity I've never felt
There's a peace and a quiet in this island of ours
Can't be mirrored by anywhere else
Homes protruding from stones with their wood-coloured black
Scattered cars in a line, steam risin' out the shaft
One door at the front, and then just glass out the back for the view
And the blue is so bright, you'll need shades for your eyes
And a cable to pull over
Take a walk and feel like everything will be fine
It's a new day, and this is England
