It's dark in the day, and I'll say, "Now, don't complain
Look up, the sun is just a cloud away"
You're so afraid to cry, but your heart be feeling dry
It's time to change
But you keep thundering, thundering
I'm wondering, wondering
Why you keep thundering?
Won't you just rain and get it over with?
When I feel the pain now, babe, I won't complain
I'll hear you saying, "Look up, the sun is just a cloud away"
And I was so afraid to cry
But when you need a way to ride, that's the way
You keep thundering, thundering
I'm wondering, wondering, why you keep thundering?
Won't you just fucking rain and get it over with?
And get it over with
I see you rolling in (in the clouds)
Let's get it over with
Get high and float again (in the clouds)
Roll up and go again
I see you rolling in (in the clouds)
Let's get it over with
Get high and float again (in the clouds)
Roll up and go again
It's alright, we can roll in the clouds
Getting high, we can float in the clouds
It's alright, we can roll in the clouds
Getting high, we can float in the clouds
It's alright, we can roll in the clouds
Getting high, we can float in the clouds
You keep thundering, thundering
I'm wondering, wondering, why you keep thundering?
Won't you just fucking rain and get it over with?
And get it over with
And get it over with (start it with lightning)
No, no, no, you should be lighting it up (it's alright, we can roll in the clouds)
No, no, start it with lighting (and get it over with)
No, no, no, you should be lighting it up (getting high, we can float in the clouds)
No, no, start it with lighting (and get it over with)
We should be lighting it up
We should be lighting it up
We should be lighting it up
Start it with lightning
It's dark in the day, and I'll say, "Now, don't complain
Look up, the sun is just a cloud away"
