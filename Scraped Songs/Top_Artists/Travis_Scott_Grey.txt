We wake up when the sun goes down
Neighbor says, "The smell's too loud"
Ridin' in my old-school thing
Shotgun with my old-school babe
So wake me when the sun goes down
Tonight's my last night in town
I pledge to a flag so grey (oh yeah, baby)
No matter what time, the skies are grey
Ooh, around this time, was starving, no Ramadan
Yeah, might've robbed you blind
You, you, you, your dad and moms
Yeah, keep that in mind
Fear two things, being broke and dying
Yeah, jump your ass inside, LSD, come take this ride
No A-C-I-D, how you get your ass inside?
Yeah, take one peek at me, you might get lost in my mind
Yeah, fuck that college shit, that scholarship, let's hypnotize (grey)
Yeah, ooh (uh)
We wake up when the sun goes down
Neighbor says, "The smell's too loud"
Ridin' in my old-school thing

So wake me when the sun goes down
Tonight's my last night in town
I pledge to a flag so grey (oh yeah, baby, no matter what time)
No matter what time, the skies are grey
(Grey) yeah, oh
(Grey) yeah
(Grey) yeah, oh (uh)
(Grey) the sky is grey
(Grey) mm-mm, mm-mm-mm
(Grey) mm-mm, mm-mm-mm
(Grey) the sky is grey (uh-huh)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh (grey)
Yeah, yeah (grey)
Oh-oh-oh, whoa (grey)
Yeah, yeah (uh-huh)
The sky is grey
Yeah, yeah, the sky is grey
Mmm-mm, oh (grey!)
Might be the last time I trip
I know I said this shit last time (grey!), but damn
I never had a trip like this (trip like this)
Who knew a three-way on freeway
Can trip with three hoes to a six-way?
Ain't gotta finesse out the midway
So Bird can wrap birds in that Ben-Gay
No more, goddamn (goddamn...)
And pops never gave me shit (gave me shit...)
But pops ain't raised no bitch (no bitch...)
I swung, I missed, he swung, he hit, then I hit that ditch (hit that ditch...)
Raised in a town where they looked so good
Outside like it ain't that serious (ain't that serious...)
My nigga got dumb years doing dumb shit
Locked up in the car, had to pull a gun quick
Killer tatted on his face, leaked to his conscious
Now he stuck in a cell, know he feeling nauseous (feeling nauseous...)
The nigga so good, he was so cold
Another lost kid, Mo City soul (yeah-yeah)
The sky is grey, whoa-oh, go
Mm-mm, mm-mm, yeah
