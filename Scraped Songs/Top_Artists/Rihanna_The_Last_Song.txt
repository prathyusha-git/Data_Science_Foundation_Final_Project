Here we are
Midair off of the cliff
Staring down at the end again
But then again, maybe we're finally on
The road that's headed away
From all your complaining
Of hearing the same song
But baby, we'll hear it when I'm gone
It's time to turn on
The last song (oh)
The last song (oh)
What if you wasted love and our love in time disappeared
And the sad song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear?
It was ours, but I'd do it again
Holding hands with my friend again
But then again
Maybe we gave our all
A song we'll never forget
Baby, let 'em play it
Maybe it'll save the world
They gon' miss hearing it when it's gone
But it's time to turn on
The last song (oh)
The last song (oh)
What if we left every moment that we could spare
And the perfect song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear?
You'll never know when the song's gonna play
The last song you'll hear is the one you made
Your song was beautiful, that's why I started singing it
But this song is our song, oh, it's playing 'til the end
Even if it's the last song
♪
The last song (oh)
The last song (oh)
What if you wasted love and our love in time disappeared
And the perfect song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear?
