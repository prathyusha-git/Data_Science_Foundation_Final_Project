I don't know who you are, but one day I'm going to
And it's gonna break my heart when she gives hers to you
And it won't be tomorrow but it's gonna be too soon
When I walk her down that aisle and do what daddy's have to do
And she might be wearin' white
But her first dress it was pink
She might be your better half
Yeah, but she's my everything
We'll both love her forever
But I loved her long before
And one day I know I'll give her away
Buddy, that don't mean she's yours
♪
Yesterday she said her first word
She's a long way from "I do"
Right now she runs to me
One day she'll run to you
And it's gonna be your best day
But it's gonna be my worst
You might watch her walkin' towards you, but I
Saw her walkin' first
And she might be wearin' white
But her first dress it was pink
She might be your better half
Yeah, but she's my everything
We'll both love her forever
But I loved her long before
And one day I know I'll give her away
Buddy, that don't mean she's yours
'Cause she's still my little girl
It's crazy thinkin' one day she'll be someone else's world
And she might be wearin' white
But her first dress it was pink
She might be your better half
But to me she's everything
And we'll both love her forever
But I loved her long before
And one day I know I'll give her away
Buddy, that don't mean she's yours
Even if she takes your last name
Buddy, that don't mean she's yours
