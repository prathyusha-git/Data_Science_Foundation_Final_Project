Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere

Maybe I stare too much, maybe not long enough
Funny how I forget to blink
When you let down your hair, dancin' like no one's there
I know I'm where I'm supposed to be
Say, "I love you" under my breath
More times than you can digest
Music every time I hear your name, oh
Your head's layin' right on my chest
Sun's up, but I still ain't got no rest
Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
When I can't feel you, I feel out of touch
Two seconds without you's like two months
Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
'Cause eternity with you ain't long enough
Two seconds without you's like two months
And that's too much
Love the way you love your mom
Take on all your friends problems
Still somehow stop the world for us, oh-oh
I still relieve that second
I made my biggest blessing
Prayed for you, look what God has turned
Say, "I love you" under my breath
More times than you can digest
Music every time I hear your name, oh
Your head's layin' right on my chest
Sun's up, but I still ain't got no rest
Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
When I can't feel you, I feel out of touch
Two seconds without you's like two months
Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
'Cause eternity with you ain't long enough
Two seconds without you's like two months
And that's too much
