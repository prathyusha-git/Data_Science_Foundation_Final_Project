Don't want to sober up
The sun is killing my buzz, that's why they call it "mourning"
Thought I was strong enough
Threw my bottle at the sky, said, "God that's a warning"
Don't want to sober up
Try to keep it inside, but I just want to pour it
Thought I was strong enough
Got a lot of shit to say, couldn't fit it in the chorus
I just left Wally spend a Maserati
The way I gotta flex, you'd think I did Pilates
I called my quote on quote friends, "Do you got plans?"
Turns out everyone's free when the dinner is
Then they drag me to a party out in Malibu
After 30 High Noons, it was pretty cool
Tried to shoot my shot, she told me that she had a shoot, bye-bye (damn) (hick)
Don't want to sober up
The sun is killing my buzz, that's why they call it "mourning"
Thought I was strong enough
Threw my bottle at the sky, said, "God that's a warning"
Don't want to sober up
Try to keep it inside, but I just want to pour it
Thought I was strong enough
Got a lot of shit to say, couldn't fit it in the chorus
Stumbling down a corridor, came across an open door
Throwing up is easy, and who put on The Commodores?
That's a nice tile floor, wish I got to know you more
Who am I talking to? Nobody
Take me outside, I'm a little too high
Paid a little too much for the time of my life
When money ain't a problem, everyone's sliding
Even when I tell myself that I
Don't want to sober up
The sun is killing my buzz, that's why they call it "mourning"
Thought I was strong enough (strong enough)
Threw my bottle at the sky, said, "God that's a warning"
Don't want to sober up
Try to keep it inside, but I just want to pour it
Thought I was strong enough
Got a lot of shit to say, couldn't fit it in the chorus
