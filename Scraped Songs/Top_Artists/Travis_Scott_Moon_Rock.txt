Been poppin'
Foldin' this money, can't make a knot
How not? High on moon rock
Y'all still locked, uh
After 12, we hit the gate and flood the spot, uh
Six of them are thots
No lights, this ice, it blinds
Clothes hit the mall, we buy the whole thing
Big gas, it's lit, propane
One hit, one touch, La Flame
Know that you niggas never liked me
Know that you niggas sit beside me, tryna slide on my sidepiece
Tint all through the whip, I hope it can hide me
Tip all of the bitches, I don't want no funny business
Don't want them to try me
They wanna slide in my IV
Ran 12 red lights, 12 behind me
Paparazzi flashes wanna deprive me
Hypnotized, I cannot let it blindside me, no
I'ma live and die by my Migos
Why I'm startin' to dance, what in the hell did you hand me?
Took all of my niggas off Xans, all of my bitches on Plan B
