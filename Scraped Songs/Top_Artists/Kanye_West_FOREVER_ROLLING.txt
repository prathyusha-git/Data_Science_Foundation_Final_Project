Took nothin' to somethin', I took the time out, too
Led under-dividers to strugglin' and they never found out who
I call the vision in Saudi, it's like a hide-out
I make a move in the mornin', fuck it, let's ride out
Them Lamborghinis be skridin' on any corner
Ain't really nothin' I ain't had, nigga, you know I ain't lyin'
"Keep your money in front you," I had to tell the lil' homie
You stop believin' these hoes, you had the time of your life
Mask on out in public like you ain't never know him
Pills turn 'em to zombies, now they're forever rollin'
How many times you ain't warn 'em, then they tell you what you gonna do?
Had to dip off from London, I had too many that night
Fuck your favorite rapper, his number ain't even numbers
Fuck your latest designer, this that new Yeezy come-up
Platinum cars turn milk chocolate to peanut butter
Niggas claimin' they called me, ain't even had my number
In the midst of the storm and you see me stuntin' on 'em
He gon' handle that for you, now you forever owe him
Fuck the head of the company, I'm the better owner
Y'all put hurdles in front of me with bananas on 'em
Then you wonder why a ape'll go bananas on 'em
Protect your head from this burn, like it's tannin' lotion
See, we started off hustlin', then we ended up ballin'
I had to follow my callin', now we forever rollin'
Forever rollin'
Forever rollin'
Forever rollin'
Forever rollin'
Why you always act like you want me to come and jack you up?
Never gon' be you against the world 'cause I'ma back you up
You know why we stand there, bro, the cap ain't nothin'
I was on my last and I can't ask for nothin'
They get on yo' ass soon as I press the button
It ain't no comparison, I'm one of one
I pray God amputate my legs if I was to ever run
Youngins doin' shit I don't condone, but I still pay they bond
I don't fuck with dog, but I look out for mom, though
Bro needed a spot, I let 'em play the condo
I know that I'm that, but I still play it humble
Said you had my back, but you ain't never come through
Told you to go back 'cause I didn't really want you
Beg me to come back, you know I always come through
Tell me where you gon' run to
You tell it your way, I tell mine, but it's only one truth
Damn, if I don't even sometime, even damned if I do
Had somebody knew what we talk about, that shit lame, too
All we ever had was the block
Bro, we damn near raised each other
Never let them break up the gang, we gotta stay together
However, I see that they playin' and I'ma play it better
You know that we all that we got, so we gotta stay together
Same friend ain't doin' nothin', you love 'em, send 'em letters
Know I'm going over the top for you, I'll pay whatever
Ain't no stoppin', I'm all in, you know I gotta get one
The world got a whole lot to offer, you got to live a little
Some shit I can't figure out, and I'll probably never get it
(I'll probably never get it)
Forever rollin'
Forever rollin'
Forever rollin'
Forever rollin'
