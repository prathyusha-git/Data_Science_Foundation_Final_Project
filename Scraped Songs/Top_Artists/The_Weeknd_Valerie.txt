There comes a time in a man's life
Where he must take responsibility
For the choices he has made
There are certain things that he must do
Things that he must say
Like, I love you
And, I need you
I only want you
And nobody's going to know if it's true
I never thought I'd feel this kind of hesitation (To put)
My hand on another girl (Ooh)
I wish I didn't have to lie
I wish I could let you know
'Cause I love you
And I need you
I only want you
And nobody's going to know if it's true

Valerie (Oh, Valerie)
I know you can see through me
(I know you can see through my lies, oh oh)
Valerie (Oh Valerie)
You just choose to never know
(No you just don't know, what I do, what I do)
Valerie (Valerie)
Why pretend to trust in me?
(I don't know why you try to trust in me, baby but I think I might know)
Valerie (Oh-oh, Valerie)
You'd rather this than be alone
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
'Cause I love you
And I need you
I only want you
And nobody's going to know if it's true
'Cause I love you
And I need you
I only want you
♪
And nobody's going to know if it's true
And I love you
('Cause I love you baby)
And I need you
(When I need, need)
I only want you
And nobody gonna know (Oh-ooh)
