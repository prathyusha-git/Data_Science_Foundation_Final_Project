I'm starting to be open to
The idea that you know me too
I like it when you hold me to ya
And I like it when you scold me too, ah
Well, your lips and fingernails are all glowing
And I know that I should be going, but I need
Devotion
And you flick another ash out on the old
On the old patio
And I get
To hoping
I'd rather take the long way home (baby, I'm speeding)
So we could laugh and sing a couple more songs (so sweet to me, you know)
Stay up late and watch your favorite show (hey Carrie, ooh woo)
Roll some weed and cuddle up real close
When your lips and fingernails are all mine
I promise to take my time giving you devotion
When something's wrong you can tell me 'bout the whole thing
If you call out to me, I'll swing
Leave the door open
For me
I like it when you rock me steady (just like a baby)
I don't mind it when you talk to me sideways (I don't mind it)
Well, I done read, I done learned every move in your body
Don't waste another dime
That's good jukebox money, honey
And if you kiss me, I might yell out hallelujah
And if you miss me, I'm running right to ya
Giving you devotion
And if you touch me, I might holler like oh man
Baby, play another slow jam
Gimme some devotion
