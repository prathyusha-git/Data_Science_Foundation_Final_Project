Oh, I could let you make your mistake on your own, oh
You could learn the easy way, you could go the hard way (hard way)
As long as you're around me (me, around me), I know I'll be fine (fine, fine, fire)

When I lie awake (when I lie), I can't tell the way I see you down
See the clock starts to break then I run, babe (ooh)
Oh, I don't just walk, I'm runnin' back to you
Back to you (I'm runnin' back to you, ooh)

Only to get to you now (only to get to you, get to you, get to you), oh, yeah
And I would run a thousand miles (thousand miles) oh, yes, I will to get to you (to get to you)
Oh-oh (oh-ooh), with every fiber (with every fiber)
Oh, just sign the dotted line (ooh-whoa)
