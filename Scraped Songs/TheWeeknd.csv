I just did the best thing I could with them because
They know fucking well I love them
But I didn't do the best I could
I didn't know what the fuck I was doing
I didn't
I will never forget watching my mother get put in a straight jacket
And taken out of my home when I was only seven years old
She was diagnosed with dementia praecox and put in a mental institution
Leaving my daddy alone with me and my little brother Lloyd
I later had an evil stepmother
Who further cemented the idea that I didn't need a mother
Growing up without one
Had long lasting impressions I didn't fully understand until much later in life
It bled into my relationships with family
And those I had become romantically involved with
Whenever I got too close to a woman I would cut her off

I would never let down my guard
And I hope you feel like dirt when I hoe'd you

And you just really wanna thrill seek
Said you left him for good this time
Bullshit, what your friends do, spill beans?
Or you just wanna be guilt free and still creep
But these hills see, from that POV
We can touch but the only way you'll film me
Is with a camera, feel me?
You're nothing but a barfly
You got your sights set on the one who you run to
But I'm a far cry from what you might get, if we come true
So keep texting me, but at night, if you seek those thrills
