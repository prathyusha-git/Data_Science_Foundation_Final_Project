You needed me but you needed drugs more
And I couldn't watch it happen
I changed into goddesses, villains and fools
Changed plans and lovers and outfits and rules
All to outrun my desertion of you
And you just watched it
If you want to break my cold, cold heart
Just say, 'I loved you the way that you were'
If you want to tear my world apart
Just say you've always wondered
If the glint in my eye traced the depths of your sigh
Down that passage in time
Back to the moment I crashed into you
Like so many wrecks do
Too impaired by my youth
To know what to do
So if I sell my apartment
And you have some kids with an internet starlet
Will that make your memory fade from this scarlet maroon
Like it never happened
Could it be enough to just float in your orbit
Can we watch our phantoms like watching wild horses
Cooler in theory but not if you force it
To be, it just didn't happen
So if you want to break my cold, cold heart
Say you loved me

Stopped trying to drill the safe

Two graves, one gun

My white knuckle dying grip
Holding tight to your quiet resentment and
My friends said it isn't right to be scared
Every day of a love affair
Every breath feels like rarest air
When you're not sure if he wants to be there

Did you think I had in me?
How much tragedy?
Just how low did you think I'd go?
Before I'd self-implode
Before I'd have to go be free

I died on the altar waiting for the proof
You sacrificed us to the gods of your bluest days

But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all, oh
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys
""Fuck the patriarchy"" keychain on the ground
We were always skipping town
And I was thinking on the drive down
""Anytime now, he's gonna say it's love""
You never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to
As I reached for you, but all I felt was shame
And you held my lifeless frame
And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer, and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah
Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well (yeah)
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell every time
You double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel
Whose shine reflects on you
Not weeping in a party bathroom
Some actress asking me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You, who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sipping coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning 21""
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so (loved you so)
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known

I remember it all too well (oh, oh)
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
And I was never good at telling jokes, but the punchline goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?

Once, I was the great hope for a dynasty
Crowds would hang on my words, and they trusted me
Their faith was strong, but I pushed it too far
I held that grudge 'til it tore me apart
Power went to my head, and I couldn't stop
Ones I loved tried to help, so I ran them off

Falling down like promises that I never kept

Now they're screaming that they hate me

Clutching their pearls, sighing ""What a mess""

... cause they hate you
Too high a horse
For a simple girl to rise above it
They slammed the door on my whole world

No, I'm not coming to my senses
I know he's crazy but he's the one I want
Dutiful daughter, all my plans were laid
Tendrils tucked into a woven braid
Growing up precocious sometimes means not growing up at all
He was chaos, he was revelry
Bedroom eyes like a remedy
Soon enough the elders had convened
Down at the city hall
""Stay away from her""
The saboteurs protested too much
Lord knows the words we never heard
Just screeching tires and true love

God save the most judgmental creeps

Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see
Thinking it can change the beat
Of my heart when he touches me
And counteract the chemistry
And undo the destiny

Me and my wild boy
And all this wild joy

Bestow upon my fakest smiles

So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry but I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
No, no, oh-oh

High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone
In silent screams
In wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive, back from the dead (oh, oh, oh)
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me (oh, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
Baby, I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern burning
Flickered in my mind for only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone
In losing grip
On sinking ships
You showed up just in time
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive, back from the dead (oh, oh, oh)
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me (oh, oh, oh)
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark (oh, oh, oh)
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me (oh, oh, oh)
This love
This love
This love
This love
This love
Your kiss, my cheek, I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost, I fell to my knees
When you're young, you just run
But you come back to what you need

Foolish One (Taylor’s Version) (From The Vault),Speak Now (Taylor's Version),https://open.spotify.com/album/5AEDGbliTTfjOB8TSm1sxt,2023,129948195,"My cards are on the table, yours are in your hand
Chances are, tonight, you've already got plans
And chances are I will talk myself to sleep again
You give me just enough attention to keep my hopes too high
Wishful thoughts forget to mention when something's really not right
And I will block out these voices of reason in my head
And the voices say, ""You are not the exception
You will never learn your lesson""
Foolish one
Stop checking your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
You know how to keep me waiting, I know how to act like I'm fine
Don't know what to call this situation, but I know I can't call you mine
And it's delicate, but I will do my best to seem bulletproof
'Cause when my head is on your shoulder, it starts thinking you'll come around
And maybe someday when we're older, this is something we'll laugh about
Over coffee every morning while you're watching the news
But then the voices say, ""You are not the exception
You will never learn your lesson""
Foolish one
Stop checking your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
Foolish one
Stop checking your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out
Now I'm slidin' down the wall with my head in my hands
Sayin', ""How could I not see the signs?""
Oh, you haven't written me or called
But goodbye screamin' in the silence
And the voices in my head are tellin' me why
'Cause you got her on your arm and me in the wings
I'll get your longing glances, but she'll get your ring
And you will say you had the best of intentions
And maybe I will finally learn my lesson
Foolish one
Stop checking your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
Foolish one
Stop checking your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out
Oh-oh, oh, oh
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, oh
La-la-la-la-la, ain't never gonna come
Ooh, you will learn the hard way now
Foolish one
Sittin' 'round waiting for confessions of love
They ain't never gonna come
And thinkin' he's the one, you should've been walkin' out
Foolish one
The day is gonna come for your confessions of love

And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear

He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says, ""You look beautiful tonight""
And I feel perfectly fine
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2:00 a.m. and I'm cursing your name

And my heart's not breaking

On the dresser, vacant just like me

Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past
