,,,,,,
My Interpretation:,,,,,,
Why Gradient Boosting is achieved highest overall classification accuracy  and highest sensitivity ,,,,,,
"This model starts with a weak learner (small decision tree), each next tree focuses specifically on the songs the previous tree misclassified ",,,,,,
"So it incrementally corrects itself, classification errors",,,,,,
This is making boosting extremely good at capturing subtle patterns in lyrical features,,,,,,
"Lyrics data naturally is non linear data, and it has many stylistic patterns that we can observe, and the data has ",,,,,,
Gradient Boosting is excellent at modelling these fine grained differences,,,,,,
"UDAT generates hundreds of linguistic and statistical descriptors., boosting prevents the overfitting through shrinkage and learning rate",,,,,,
It outperforms RF because it focuses on hard to classify songs,,,,,,
Random Forest is the BEST 2?,,,,,,
"Lyrics are not linearly separable, with UDAT computation the feature set contains many correlated features and many irrelevant features ",,,,,,
Random Forest performs strongly because it can handle  high variance datasets(datasets with hundreds of features) ,,,,,,
"It is slightly lower than Gradient Boosting, because all the trees are independent ",,,,,,
This is saying that it is capturing features and understanding better classification ,,,,,,
