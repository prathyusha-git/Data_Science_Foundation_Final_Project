**Abstract:**
The rapid evolution of music streaming platforms has underscored the importance of both enhancing user engagement and identifying promising artists for targeted growth. This project addresses the dual challenge of (1) uncovering strategies for Spotify to improve user engagement and (2) building predictive models to forecast artist growth. Leveraging a curated dataset consisting of 40,000 songs—sourced equally from the top 20 and bottom 20 artists by popularity, with 1,000 songs per artist—we extract comprehensive audio, user interaction, and artist profile features. We employ supervised machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forests and regression models, to predict artist growth indicators based on multi-dimensional song and user engagement data. In parallel, we analyze user behaviors (e.g., skips, repeats, playlist additions) to detect patterns and drivers of long-term engagement. Unsupervised clustering and feature engineering are used to segment both artists and users, helping surface actionable insights for retention and personalized recommendations. Our approach aims not only to describe engagement and growth trends but to construct data-driven, scalable solutions for Spotify’s platform. This project demonstrates the capability of advanced analytics and machine learning to inform content strategy, drive user satisfaction, and optimize the discovery process for emerging artists
