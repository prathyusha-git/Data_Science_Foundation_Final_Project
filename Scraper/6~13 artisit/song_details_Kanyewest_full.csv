Keep my spirit alive
Keep my spirit alive, alive
More than anything
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side
Spirit won't die, yeah
Oh-oh-oh, my life
Is in his hands, so I don't stress, I pray and strategize
Yo, flushed the work just in time and they raided
Thank God (thank God)
Screamin' through the GT roof like ""-, we done made it""
Thank God (thank God)
Hundred round drum didn't jam when my shooter tried to spray it
Thank God (thank God, brr)
Drop a thousand grams, got 2000 grands, we'll be waiting
Thank God (thank God)
I was facing 15 and I beat it (and I beat it)
Just spent about 20 up at Neimans (up at Neimans)
Did 200 in a demon (in a demon, skrrt)
I'm the illest - and I mean it (and I mean it)
My homie dropping bodies for no reason (boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
Now his kids see him on the weekends (argh)
Got the baking soda for the remix (remix)
Millionaires on, I can see it

No weapon formed against me 'cause I'm covered in the blood
Laying in the hospital when I got shot, fam
Mama prayed for me, said she left it in God's hands, yeah
So I'ma leave it in God's hands
Everything I'm doing now is God's plan
Doctor said I wouldn't walk no more, now I stand
Then I ran, here I am, Machine
Keep my spirit alive
More than anything
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side
Well, between a mix of bad schools with the fast-food
Bad-had tools and a bad mood
If you don't turn to a Lil Gotti
They gon' drain all the strength in your lil' body
They turned me into a Lil Gotti, uh, yeah
Not Wakanda, but Wakanda is kinda like what we 'bout to make
And who gon' make it? Kan', duh
Who the squad? Donda
Who the mom? Donda
Who can see? Don, duh, get Don C
Who needs practice? I don't do rehearsals
And I don't do commercials 'cause they too commercial
Give it all to God and let Jesus reimburse you
She said, ""You in the studio with who? I'ma hurt you""
How I'm 42 and you got a curfew?
How nerves dictate how they gon' curve you?
Quiet all the cordialness
We walk in God's spiritual ordinance
We know the blacks, the orphans, refused to be runaways
Rebel, renegade, must stay paid
More than anything
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side
Spirit won't die-ie

Where they're taking it easy, swapping personal experiences
Let's listen in America Today
Life of the party, mhm, 'til I almost cry, mhm
It's the life of the party, to think I could've almost died
Lord, help us
Hey, Miss Donda
You run into my mama, please tell her I said ""Say something""
I'm startin' to believe ain't no such thing as Heaven's trumpets
No after-over, this is it, done
If there's a Heaven, you would think they'd let ya speak to your son
Maybe she has in the form of a baby's laugh
I heard passing by in a stroller reminding me, ""Hey, keep rolling""
I don't know, maybe she has with a prick of a blade of grass
I've been laying on way too long, got me itchy
Got up and roamed a lil' more
Miss Donda, you see my mama, tell her I'm lost
You see, she'd always light a cigarette, we talk, I would cough
Exaggerating a lil' bit so she get the point
Tryna get her to stop smoking, I would leave and fire up a joint
'Til I quit, started back up again, 20 years later
All that time, y'all thought a n- was high, thought I was crazy
My mom, she ain't cut no corners
Got me back on track, I don't miss her overstepping
But do miss her showing Seven civilian life sh-
Ah, Miss Donda, you see my mama, whisper her this
The real reason I was geeked to go to church
Must confess, when y'all grown-ups would be in Bible study
That girl helping me with my homework? Her and I were f-
So pure and p-, so spirit spinning and dirty
So on, so on, and so on, we hoped that no one heard us
And to this day, I think her mama knew but let us explore
Miss Donda, you see my father, please, ask him why he never married
Always smiled, but was he happy inside?
Because I carried my mother's name, did he carry shame with him?
I'm sure she did it out of spite, it was her decision at birth
Shit, she probably was hurt, ah, poor baby
Two young people with different views, a lot for a young lady
No coincidence, they both passed away from heart conditions
There's a dissidence at play, dad and mom do hard division
Three Thou', poster child for big - raised by their mothers
I'm supposed to smile as if God knew that I would be troubled
Keeps me around, for what? I don't know
But I do know that it's crucial, that we do so, pronto
I don't know how much long though
Straight from Shibuya, on some zen
We back, ramped up, we on ten
It's a marathon and look, we coming for the win
Just like Puff told Christopher, we gon' win big (c'mon)
Put the whole family on, look at what my Kim did
Just like Puff told Christopher, we gon' win big (uh)
We gon' win big (what?)
Southside gang mentality way heavy
I was thinking out the box even in a Box Chevy
And my favorite art teacher name was Mrs. Levy
'Round the time, I learned to put my feelings to a medley (the life of the party)
I ain't turn in homework for like four months and I bet she let me
She saw the vision
""Yeezy you special, go make your own decisions then""
Man, that was a good choice, faith driving us like a Rolls Royce
♪
They tried to take my voice away, I ain't try to take ya choice away
I just prayed the water break, just for my daughter sake, from a slip-up
Fake signatures from fake managers, it all damage her, good Lord
Give 'em enough of they own rope to hang 'em with
The paparazzi never really got what my angle is
They treat my married life like some type of entanglement
My neighbor still dissing, wondering why I ain't saying it
I can smell the setup, that's that 2Pac in Vegas hit
I revealed myself and some don't know what to make of it
God has said himself to make sure that the baby live
And if Ye ain't here, then tell me who gonna say this here?
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a goddamn minute
Let me stop playing with it, hopped in a Lamb' with it
Hopped in a Lamb' with it, in a damn pandemic
Know that Uncle Sam gotta have his damn hand in it
Listen, straight from Shibuya, on some zen
I'm on ten, it's a marathon and look, we comin' for the win

I'm so proud of you (yup), you're gonna have so much fun
They gonna shoot us in the air, mama, okay?

Now we've been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
He lives in a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Sittin' by myself, I'm just thinkin'
About all I've been through, I wish I was dreaming (Jesus)
Man, it's hard to be an angel when you surrounded by demons (Lord)
I watched so many people leave (Jesus, Lord)
I see 'em change by the season, that's mama's seasonin'
God got you, the devil's watchin', he just peekin' in
I know I made a promise that I'd never let the reaper in (Jesus)
But lately, I've been losing all my deepest friends (Lord)
And lately, I've been swimmin' on the deepest end
It's just drugs, it ain't no hugs, it ain't no love there
You been down so much you don't even know what's upstairs (Jesus)
Suicidal thoughts got you wonderin' what's up there (Lord)
And while they introduce a party, they say it's up there
Too many pills, so much potions, so much pain, too many emotions
And everything that you do good, it just go unnoticed (Jesus)
Then they tell you that you good, and just stay focused (Lord)
Mama, you was the life of the party
I swear you brought life to the party
When you lost your life, it took the life out the party (Jesus)
That woman rode with me like a Harley (Lord)
Visions of my cousins in a cell really scarred me
Movin' to the hood was like signin' up for the army
'Cause they been killin' n-, since n- was watchin' Barney (Jesus)
You want dreams to come true? But I had nightmares (Lord)
'Cause if that come to life, then I might not be right here
Been in the dark so long, don't know if the light here
But I'm just reaching for the stars like Buzz Lightyear (Jesus)
And now I'm lightyears ahead of those nightmares (Lord)
I deaded those night tears when the night clears
And if I talk to Christ, could I bring my mother back to life?
And if I die tonight, will I see her in the afterlife? (Jesus)
But back to reality, where everything's a tragedy (Lord)
And better have a strategy or you could be a statistic
Little boy dies, he's just one of the mystic
And mama steady crying, 'cause she really the victim (Jesus)
Now she's getting high and she's getting addicted (Lord)
And her older boy just stuck with the picture, painted vivid
That's a family portrait, and her daughter just absorbed it
16, pregnant, baby daddy say she should abort it (Jesus)
But we can't afford it, so she decides to move forward (Lord)
Baby shower time, father didn't show up
Now she just feeling nauseous like she finna throw up
The water flows down her legs, yeah, it's finna go up (Jesus)
A year done went by, her daughter just turned one (Lord)
And she's still dependent on her mom
Big brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun
He want revenge 'cause the pain, feelin' numb (Jesus)
And her mom still doing drugs 'cause that's the only time she feel loved (Lord)
But is it real love? Do the scars really heal up?
From all the pain that done built up, but they don't feel us (Jesus)
A week done flew by, big bro ridin' then he see the guys (Lord)
Left his little brother on the side, bleeding from the side
He seein' red it's like he's bleeding through his eyes
To see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grieving up inside (Jesus)
He even let him get they last meal
He done with the streets after this, this his last kill (Lord)
He gotta show him that it's that real
He ran up on him with the pipe like, ""N-, stand still"" (Jesus)
""You took my brother life, you made my mother cry"" (Lord)
""Tell me one reason I shouldn't send you up to Christ""

My sword or my microphone, I swore to the Christ's throne
But when you great, they wanna say you took an L, José Castillo (Jesus)
I'm in the fight here, fight here, for what seemed like lightyears (Lord)
My rugged cross and thorny crowns squeeze out Christ tears
30 pieces of silver clout, my Pierre price tier

It's like the last days of Sodom and Gomorrah outside (Lord)
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

You ain't really happy for me, you mad that I pop (Jesus)
F- a car, five houses like, ""Look what I copped"" (Lord)

I don't say, ""What's up?"", you basically blocked (facts)
You see it on my head, just know that it's copped (Jesus)
Always look 'em in the face when I deal with my opp (Lord)
I'm from the bottom but Lord knows it's better up top, n-
Yeah, viral pictures (viral), Bible scriptures
One thing about the devil, he's liable to get you (Jesus)
Long as my good days outweigh my bad days (Lord)

Million dollars cashiers check to the offerin' (Lord)

What up, Ye? This Larry Hoover Jr
First and foremost, I wanna thank you
For taking the fight for my father to the Oval Office
You might not have been the only one that could've did that
But you were the one that did do that
And with your assistance
We can continue to let the world take part in this fight
You know to me it kinda feels like, me, my mother, my brothers
And my kids have all been incarcerated through this journey
And we haven't even been to jail
We've been looked at and treated as criminals, for being a part of this family
My father's truth and the reality that he raised me in
Is that he wanted to make a change in this community
'Cause the conditions in this capitalist society
Is what made him, and it's what made the children of today
After 25 years of bein' locked down, 23 and 1
My father has not called any shots
From one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world
And will not, once released
Call any of the shots for the Gangster Disciples
If my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction
Into the hell that he has had to live in for the past 26 years
Man, he would be dead to me
I didn't sign up for that
I didn't stay on this journey this long for that
All my life, man, I've been waitin' for my father to come home
They told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home
Then they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home
I went away to Morris Brown, I graduated and he still ain't home
Now I'm a adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated
He still not home
Now even more than that, my son
He graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'
Matter of fact, he hasn't hugged
Kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren
And they haven't been able to touch they grandfather
Even though it is not seen that way for some of us
But for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community

By some dude who's more rather into greed
Played by your emotions, you were swamped by your needs
Told me, I didn't believe, you said I was out to deceive, ahaha
You said that I lie, how did I?
I told you everything, didn't I?
But you just could not believe... man, I'm so peeved
Your friends all up in your head even when we're in bed
Your mind's elsewhere, and you say you care? Haha

And if I die tonight, will I see her in the afterlife? (Jesus)

What up, Ye? This Larry Hoover Jr
First and foremost, I wanna thank you
For taking the fight for my father to the Oval Office
You might not have been the only one that could've did that
But you were the one that did do that
And with your assistance
We can continue to let the world take part in this fight
You know to me it kinda feels like, me, my mother, my brothers
And my kids have all been incarcerated through this journey
And we haven't even been to jail
We've been looked at and treated as criminals, for being a part of this family
My father's truth and the reality that he raised me in
Is that he wanted to make a change in this community
'Cause the conditions in this capitalist society
Is what made him, and it's what made the children of today
After 25 years of bein' locked down, 23 and 1
My father has not called any shots
From one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world
And will not, once released
Call any of the shots for the Gangster Disciples
If my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction
Into the hell that he has had to live in for the past 26 years
Man, he would be dead to me
I didn't sign up for that
I didn't stay on this journey this long for that
All my life, man, I've been waitin' for my father to come home
They told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home
Then they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home
I went away to Morris Brown, I graduated and he still ain't home
Now I'm a adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated
He still not home
Now even more than that, my son
He graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'
Matter of fact, he hasn't hugged
Kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren
And they haven't been able to touch they grandfather
Even though it is not seen that way for some of us
But for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community

Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me

Fucked up the middle part, and mumble the endin'?
It just feels better, in my humble opinion
Much more n-words, but humble beginnings
When I act like the n-word, somebody get injured
That's why we stay in court and go to the pen' for it
Before I forget, let me go get a pen for it
Cancel culture, before I get censored
All I really meant for is you to get mentored
Before we get sentenced, before we get sent for
Remember this sentence, remember repentance
Only God can judge me, GDs and Vice Lords
Over in Danville, Stateville, Taylorville, Menard
Jacksonville, Pontiac, Pinckneyville
We mass targeted, mass marketed
Mass incarceration, mass in police stations
Mass incorporated, fuck Adidas (my soul)
Won't be gettin' sleep tonight, and I'm cryin' as I write this
Prayin' for my brother, locked up, fightin' fires
And my heart goes out to all the daughters missing God and fathers
Never see they loved ones 'cause they're prisoners, fightin' fires

And the prisoners fightin' fires, oh, yeah (my soul)

My freedom so close, I can taste it
Make money, got bills, so I chase it
But stay on my Deen, 'cause without it, I'm faithless
They promise they with you, they lies
They just want what you got and they try
All alone with nobody beside
You sit there and cry, just wishin' you die
Know this life is a test, tryna pass it
With my face on the ground in the Masjid
You got questions, so you better ask 'em
'Cause time wait for no one, it comes and it passes
Under pressure, attack on me daily
Love my mama, she tried, couldn't save me
Gave me tools to survive through this crazy
""Fear nothing but God, and be good to your lady""
Wait on tears and no one understand
It's predestined and God got a plan
One thing I know, he made me a man
He gave me two legs on the ground on to stand
To my wifey, baby, you so fine
Proud to say to the world, ""Yeah, you mine""
You stood by me through all the hard times
You pushed the line, you pushed the line
I, I can feel you light up on me
Keep shinin' your light up on me

What up, Ye? This Larry Hoover Jr.
First and foremost, I wanna thank you
For taking the fight for my father to the Oval Office
You might not have been the only one that could've did that
But you were the one that did do that
And with your assistance
We can continue to let the world take part in this fight
You know to me it kinda feels like, me, my mother, my brothers
And my kids have all been incarcerated through this journey
And we haven't even been to jail
We've been looked at and treated as criminals, for being a part of this family
My father's truth and the reality that he raised me in
Is that he wanted to make a change in this community
'Cause the conditions in this capitalist society
Is what made him, and it's what made the children of today
After 25 years of bein' locked down, 23 and 1
My father has not called any shots
From one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world
And will not, once released
Call any of the shots for the Gangster Disciples
If my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction
Into the hell that he has had to live in for the past 26 years
Man, he would be dead to me
I didn't sign up for that
I didn't stay on this journey this long for that
All my life, man, I've been waitin' for my father to come home
They told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home
Then they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home
I went away to Morris Brown, I graduated and he still ain't home
Now I'm a adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated
He still not home
Now even more than that, my son
He graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'
Matter of fact, he hasn't hugged
Kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren
And they haven't been able to touch they grandfather
Even though it is not seen that way for some of us
But for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community
Who deserves to breathe free air

He lives in a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Sittin' by myself, I'm just thinkin'
About all I've been through, I wish I was dreamin'
Man, it's hard to be an angel when you surrounded by demons (Jesus, Lord)
I watched so many people leave
I see 'em change by the season, that's mama's seasonin'
God got you, the devil's watchin', he just peekin' in
I know I made a promise that I'd never let the reaper in (Jesus)
But lately, I've been losin' all my deepest friends (Lord)
And lately, I've been swimmin' on the deepest end
It's just drugs, it ain't no hugs, it ain't no love there
You been down so much you don't even know what's upstairs
Suicidal thoughts got you wonderin' what's up there (Jesus, Lord)
And while I introduce the party, they say it's up there
Too many pills, so much potions, so much pain, too many emotions
And everything that you do good, it just go unnoticed (Jesus)
Then they tell you that you good and just stay focused (Lord)
Mama, you was the life of the party
I swear you brought life to the party
When you lost your life, it took the life out the party (Jesus)
That woman rode with me like a Harley (Lord)
Visions of my cousins in a cell really scarred me
Movin' to the hood was like signin' up for the army
'Cause they been killin' n- since n- was watchin' Barney (Jesus)
You want dreams to come true? But I have nightmares (Lord)
'Cause if that come to life, then I might not be right here

And now I'm light years ahead of those nightmares (Lord)
I deaded those night terrors when the night clears
And if I talk to Christ, can I bring my mother back to life?
And if I die tonight, will I see her in the afterlife? (Jesus)
But back to reality where everything's a tragedy (Lord)
And better have a strategy or you could be a statistic
Little boy dies, he's just one of the mystic
And mama steady cryin' 'cause she really the victim (Jesus)
Now she's gettin' high and she's gettin' addicted (Lord)
And her older boy just stuck with the picture, painted vivid
That's a family portrait and her daughter just absorbed it
16, pregnant, baby daddy say she should abort it (Jesus)
But we can't afford it, so she decides to move forward (Lord)
Baby shower time, father didn't show up
Now she just feelin' nauseous like she finna throw up
The water flows down her legs, yeah, it's finna go up (Jesus)
A year done went by, her daughter just turned one (Lord)
And she's still dependent on her mom
Big brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun
He want revenge 'cause the pain, feelin' numb (Jesus)
And her mom still doin' drugs 'cause that's the only time she feel loved (Lord)
But is it real love? Do the scars really heal up?
From all the pain that been built up, but they don't feel us (Jesus)
A week done flew by, big bro ridin' then he see the guys (Lord)
Left his little brother on the side, bleedin' from the side
He seein' red, it's like he's bleedin' through his eyes
To see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grievin' up inside (Jesus)
He even let him get they last meal (Lord)
He done with the streets after this, this his last kill
He gotta show him that it's that real
He ran up on him with the pipe like, ""N-, stand still"" (Jesus)
""You took my brother life, you made my mother cry"" (Lord)
""Tell me one reason I shouldn't send you up to Christ""
He said, ""Go 'head, take my life, I've seen everything but Christ""

Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Uh-huh, in the name of the true and living God
The beneficent, the merciful (Hallelujah)
Thank you for bringin' me up the rough side of the mountain like Ertuğrul (Jesus)
Every knee bowed and every tongue confessed and paid homage (Lord)
To the monk who visited Rothschilds like Thelonious did Pannonica (sheesh)
It's Jay Elec-entendre-nica comin' through your monitor
Back from the great beyond, the Son of Man and the son of Donda (Jesus)
I never rolled the GXSR or the R6 or the Honda (Lord)
But I flew my Ducati through North America like Wakanda
Earthquakes will strike this nation for what Bush did to Rwanda (facts)
What the Clintons did to Haiti and Downing Street did to Ghana
In Tenochtitlan they call me Terremoto, El Negro Loco (Jesus)
I shake the tectonic plates of the game if I lay one vocal (Lord)
The God is interstellar while you fellas remain local
My bars is like the pyramid temples of Pacal Votan (Jesus)
As sure as the DOJ confirmed Ezekiel's Wheel (Lord)
I could change the world like Yacub with two pieces of steel
My sword and my microphone, I swore to the Christ's throne
But when you great, they wanna say you took an L, José Castillo (Jesus)
I'm in the fight here, fight here, for what seemed like light years (Lord)
My rugged cross and thorny crowns squeeze out Christ tears
30 pieces of silver clout, my Pierre price tier
It's a war outside, it's a war outside (Jesus)
It's like the last days of Sodom and Gomorrah outside (Lord)
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
We've been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
He lives in a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

What up, Ye? This Larry Hoover Jr.
First and foremost, I wanna thank you
For taking the fight for my father to the Oval Office
You might not have been the only one that could've did that
But you were the one that did do that
And with your assistance
We can continue to let the world take part in this fight
You know to me it kinda feels like, me, my mother, my brothers
And my kids have all been incarcerated through this journey
And we haven't even been to jail
We've been looked at and treated as criminals, for being a part of this family
My father's truth and the reality that he raised me in
Is that he wanted to make a change in this community
'Cause the conditions in this capitalist society
Is what made him, and it's what made the children of today
After 25 years of bein' locked down, 23 and 1
My father has not called any shots
From one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world
And will not, once released
Call any of the shots for the Gangster Disciples
If my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction
Into the hell that he has had to live in for the past 26 years
Man, he would be dead to me
I didn't sign up for that
I didn't stay on this journey this long for that
All my life, man, I've been waitin' for my father to come home
They told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home
Then they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home
I went away to Morris Brown, I graduated and he still ain't home
Now I'm a adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated
He still not home
Now even more than that, my son
He graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'
Matter of fact, he hasn't hugged
Kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren
And they haven't been able to touch they grandfather
Even though it is not seen that way for some of us
But for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community

Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it

So goodnight, cruel world, I'll see you in the morning

I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
And I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows, he's so fucking gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece
Thinking
No one man should have all that power

Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the powder

But why I love you, I'll never know
Picture if you will that the throne is burning
Rome's burning and I'm sitting in the corner all alone burning
Why does it always end up like this?
Something that we don't determine
Same people that I fought for, that I fight for, that I ride for
That I live for, that I die for be the reason that these niggas is alive for
And they want me dead but I'm so sorry but I just can't die for you
But I can make 'em put their hands in the sky for you
We waiting for the fireworks like July 4th
Get fly more, get high more, cry boy, why for?
When the grief is over, beef is over
I'll be fly when Easter's over
I tried to teach niggas how to be kings
And all they ever wanted to be was soldiers
So the love is gone 'til blood is drawn
So we no longer wear the same uniform
Fuck you squares, the circle got smaller
The castle got bigger, the walls got taller

Niggas still got love for you

Shit feelin' like death, don't it?
Charge it to the game, whatever's left on it
I spent about a minute, maybe less on it
Fly pelican fly, turn the jets on it but first I shall digress on it
Wasn't I a good king? (Maybe too much of a good thing, huh?)
Didn't I spoil you? Me or the money, what you loyal to?

And I'm bussin' back so niggas in a glass house should not throw stones
What do you do when the love turns the hate?

So the nigga that killed him had keys to his shit

Uh, Black excellence, opulence, decadence
Tuxes next to the president, I'm present
I dress in Dries and other boutique stores in Paris
In sheepskin coats, I silence the lambs
Do you know who I am Clarice?
No cheap cologne whenever I ""shh-shh""
Success never smelled so sweet
I stink of success, the new Black elite
They say my Black Card bear the mark of the beast
I repeat, my religion is the beat
My verse is like church, my Jesus piece
Now please, domino, domino
Only spot a few Blacks the higher I go, uh
What's up to Will? Uh, shout out to O, uh
That ain't enough, we gonna need a million more, uh
Kick in the door, uh, Biggie flow
I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go
Yeah, it's all messed up when it's nowhere to go
So we won't take the time out 'til we reach the T-O-P
From parolees that hold G's, sold keys, low keys
We like the promised land of the OG's
In the past if you picture events like a black tie
What the last thing you expect to see? Black guys
What's the life expectancy for Black guys?
The system's working effectively, that's why
I'll be a real man, take care of your son
Every problem you had before this day is now done
New crib, watch a movie
'Cause ain't nothin' on the news but the blues
Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
Now ain't nothin' new but your shoes
Sunday morning, praise the Lord
You the girl that Jesus had been saving me for
So let's savor this moment and take it to the floor
Black excellence, truly yours",https://open.spotify.com/track/3Gjc2FE6BEMMHURUjlMXvX

Move blocks and squares

My Daddy did too
Paralyzed by the pain
I can barely move
My nephew gone
My heart is torn
Sometimes I look to the sky
Ask why I was born
My faith in God
Every day is hard
Every night is worse
That's why I pray so hard
Why I pray so hard
This is crazy God
Just when I thought I had everything
I lost it all
So que sera
Get a case of Syrah
Let it chase the pain
Before it goes too far
My dreams is big
Reality set in
Let off a clip from a automatic weapon
Through shots in the door
It died in Vegas
Though it fought so hard
I knew it wouldn't make it
I'm a tortured soul
I live in disguise
Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5
I died in my sleep
I'm still Big Pimpin
I ball at the mall
Beginning of the ending
Where the fuck is the sun?
It's been a while
Momma, look at ya son
What happened to my smile?
My tears is tatted
My rag in my pocket
I'm just looking for love
I know somebody got it
Champagne for the pain
Weed for the low
God damn I'm so high
Where the fuck did I go?
I'm losing myself
I'm stuck in the moment
I look in the mirror
My only opponent
Where the fuck is the press?
Where the fuck is the Pres?

No crying in public
Just lying to judges
Risking my life

Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane

Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
