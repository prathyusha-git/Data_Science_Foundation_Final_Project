Would you hide my gun? Would you tell no one?
Would you pack a never comin' back again bag?

Would you stall and let me slip out the back?

And if I did, would you hide my gun?

If you had to dig a hole, would you take it to the grave?
Put some concrete shoes at the bottom of a lake
If I shot him dead, would you shoot me straight?

Seven hundred feet off the coast of Greece
Give me somethin' I can feel
No reservation, pull up twenty deep
Give me somethin', somethin' real
I would trade it all just to be at peace
Stop, the gear's too high, this is overload
And no matter what car is sittin' outside
It's a lonely road
It's a double-edged sword
Cuttin' off ties with the ones I know
So tell me how the fuck am I still alive?
It's a miracle (no)

Ran through a B at Louis V
It's what I need right now (oh)
It's just money

I was in Maldives sippin' burgundy
Give me somethin' I can feel
Prada on my dick, Prada on my sleeves
Give me somethin', somethin' real
I could play that pussy like it's Für Elise
I got real habits
I'm a snowmobile addict
Teal Patek
Steel when I feel panic, ah
Throw a mil at it
Problem, throw a pill at it
Still at it, sign another deal addict (uh)
And I can't believe
Everybody gets to drink for free
So give me one more round (oh)
No cover fee
At the gates of hell, no VIP
Everybody waits in line
So give me somethin' I can feel
Light a cigarette just so I can breathe
Give me somethin', somethin' real
How much psilocybin can a human eat?
Give me somethin' I can feel
Whiskey lullaby just to fall asleep
Give me somethin', somethin' real
And it's what I want, it ain't what I need

When I took a ride in the dead of night
Told myself that everything was okay
Try to understand how you standin' over me
Girl, it's drivin' me crazy
Yeah, it's freezin' fuckin' cold in the dead of night
The only heat, it come from the ashtray
I might as well get high as hell and just keep actin' like
Everything doesn't phase me
Yeah, take me all the way to the top, baby
Don't even if I tell you to stop, baby
Take me all the way to the sky, baby, baby
I wanna go up there
And I don't ever wanna come down
I wanna see what's up there
Actin' like I got it all figured out
I wanna go up there
And I don't ever wanna come down
I wanna see what's up there
Must be better than the hell on the ground
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It's freezin' fuckin' cold in the dead of night
And I'ma drop the top with no Rogaine (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
And now might sound irrelevant but I prefer to stack my chips
When everything fallin' (backwoods)
And I ain't religious but I look into the sky
And pray to anyone holy
I been drinkin' way too much and man I got the blues
Because my baby don't hold me
Yeah, take me all the way to the top, baby
Don't even if I tell you to stop, baby
Take me all the way to the sky, baby, baby
I wanna go up there
And I don't ever wanna come down
I wanna see what's up there
Actin' like I got it all figured out
I wanna go up there
And I don't ever wanna come down
I wanna see what's up there
Must be better than the hell on the ground
I wanna go up there
And I don't ever wanna come down
I wanna see what's up there
