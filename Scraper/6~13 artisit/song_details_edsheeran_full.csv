You packed your bags and booked a plane
The taxi's taking you away
I know it's just a couple days
A second without you is pain
Maybe I'm just a fool who loves you
When you're here, it's a sunny place
But when you're gone, I can't explain
How everything seems to turn to grey
Even food just loses taste
Maybe I'm just a fool who loves you
When we are saying goodbye, you ask me, will I miss you?
Well, I just can't lie, I just can't lie
I'm dyin' alive every time that you leave
'Cause a life without you is not one I want to live
Kill me slowly, kill me slowly
Though I'll see you again, that don't mean it don't sting
This is knife-in-the-heart love that we've fallen in
Kill me slowly, kill me slowly
The scent of you on the pillowcase
The photo wall that has never changed
Sat on our bed in our little place
I'm still countin' down the days
Maybe I'm just a fool who loves you
Memories are all I got here
Until you call
Or whenever I hear your voice
Like you're in this room
And maybe I'm just a fool who loves you
When we are saying goodbye, you ask me, will I miss you?
Well, I just can't lie, I just can't lie
I'm dyin' alive every time that you leave
'Cause a life without you is not one I want to live
Kill me slowly, kill me slowly
Though I'll see you again, that don't mean it don't sting
This is knife-in-the-heart love that we've fallen in
Kill me slowly, kill me slowly
Ooh, ooh-ooh (kill me slowly, kill me slowly)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (kill me slowly, kill me slowly)

Whenever I'm near you, I'm in heaven
The world could separate us if we let it
But we're better than we've ever been
Never
Doubted we could sail through stormy weather
We went through the furnace, burned together
And clay turned into porcelain
Suddenly everything's frozen
Caught in the spell of this moment
Just hold me in your arms
Dance with me and sway
As the sun closes on
A beautiful day
I can see you now
Though so much has changed
I'm falling in love
All over again
Silence
There is so much said inside this silence
Some things just can't be explained by science
The energy I feel for you
Higher
Every peak we reach, we just climb higher
Held up by the force of our desire
So let's pause and just take in this view
Chemicals bursting, exploding
As every second's unfolding

There's been times I felt I could fall further
I have loved and lost and feared and prayed
But now the day bursts wild and open
I have cried tears at my brother's grave
I have shaken hands with my wife's surgeon
I spent weeks inside the darkest cage
But now the day bursts wild and open
There's a time to cry, there's a time to fold
There's a time for holdin' on and to let it go
There's a time to run to the arms of hope
And the day bursts wild and open
I was raised by the church, choir boy, still far from fizzlin'
Not the popstar they say they prefer, kept quiet, but I came to be heard
Been a long time up top, but I ain't complacent, if I look down, I can see replacements
Late-night drive with my heartbeat racin', gotta make dreams and chase 'em
Taken my fair share of that ridicule, but the words are not applicable
Catalogue formidable, me and that guy are in a different place
Undefeated, but that's temptin' fate, two of them tried it, I won both cases
Won't get back all the time they wasted, I am not losin' sleep
In this world, there's no relaxin', I've been here since migraine skankin'
Never been cool, but never been a has-been, I'd kip on your couch if you knew me back then
Don't tell 'em bout the walls you're trapped in, gotta keep this Usain pace
Don't ask me how I got this break, I built my own bricks through constant playin'
SB died, couldn't stop this pain, I look at the dots in space
I wonder if he's proud or thinks that his best friend lost his way
Keep it together for my daughters, gotta come natural, I don't wanna force it
If it's not factual, don't support it, every year, gotta re-swim these waters
Draw a line, for the sake of all your family and friends
Draw a line, so history doesn't happen again
Draw a line, for the day to start the night has to end
Draw a line, for all of these ghosts
I'm too high to fly this plane, too fucked to drive this Range
Can't remember the last time I was on my own without Kev, it's kinda strange
Not been the same since 19, now to push Ly on a swing, I gotta wear disguises
I'm up for tradin' life sometimes, and that may surprise 'em
Every stadium, I played it, but I would still do it for free
Gotta keep standards, top of the top of the tree, press still got problems with me
And when school starts, I might peace out, 'til then I keep chasin' the dream
I could end it, but I don't wanna reach out 'cause he means nothin' to me
Don't worry 'bout what I make, don't trip them up to win this race
When your career's in a risky place, everything seems like a big mistake
I'm still lookin' for shit to say, deludin' myself that they still relate
Depression, I keep at bay, tomorrow's a different day
Me and that guy don't speak no more, I know why, but he's not sure, so what is the reason for
My heart's been broke so many times by loved ones that I don't ever feel like talkin'
So heed that warning, circle keeps gettin' smaller
All I need is Chez and my daughters and a few friends to help me
Draw a line, for the sake of your little girls and their time
Draw a line, but allow yourself some moments to cry
Draw a line, and leave the past that hurt you behind
Draw a line, for all of these ghosts
Draw a line, be grateful that you've been where you've been
Draw a line, recognise the path that happened between
Draw a line, there's future here, that's yet to be seen
Draw a line

And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia

Is to make music and use it not to abuse it and
get infected effected with the who's who of music

Chitter chatter don't matter what a
Yidda yidda yadda don't matta to me

To battle this industry freely
To be me in this seedy needy world
Can you hear me?
Hey
So I keep singin that
When I first started this rappin shit I felt pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
I made for the stars
Kept my grime in the dark
Then I payed with remedy kickin rhymes with the melody
Henesey shots and all these fools on the block who said
you got to be a gangsta now to raise the top
Just a normal casual usual everyday type of guy
With my hand in the sky, ready to die

Cos if I don't have it in my pocket I'm gonna panic
Cos like I said where I come from yeah smoking it is a habit
Yup to do the bun to blaze the place up in the hood
one them things I inherited like a ghetto man should
Whenever I'm smoking weed yes it makes me feel good
Yes high grade weed yes it makes me feel
Yes it is a drug and if I start to smoke it I'mma turn into a thug
Where I come from the talking could only get you mugged
Where I come from burning weed is a blessing from above
Where I come from yes we burn it when we listen rub a dove
Where I come from after we burn it we has to make love
Where I come from yes we burn it when the sun starts shine
I blaze high grade weed all the time!

I won't stop till my name's in lights

On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young and all my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
Yep The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows
But I haven't got a house plus I live on the couch
So you can be the lyrics when I'm singing them out

From day one, I've been prepared
With vo5 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa, giving a dose of what the future holds
Cause it's another day
Rucksack with old clothes
I rap with the cold flows, I'm back with the old jokes
In fact you don't know
On tracks I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate
My flow's developing, skin lacks the melanin
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in
Do it for the hell of it cause ever since I hit the
mainstream with the A Team I seem to sell a bit
I took what held me back with the women
I packaged the image, put in some content, then sold it back as a gimmick
fact is this I'll end up dating actresses wake up on dirty mattresses,
I think i'll need to practice this
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative
World's on my shoulders I don't even know what atlas is

I say the words that make you blush

Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper

Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows
But I haven't got a house, plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out
Wow, from day one, I've been prepared
With VO5 wax for my ginger hair
So now, I'm back to the sofa
Giving a dose of what the future holds 'cause it's another day
Plus I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic

Ah, la, uhm, lala
Ah, la, uhm, lala
Ah, la, uhm, lala
Ah, la, uhm, lala
I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her, ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin'
(Ah, la, uhm, lala) Don't ... with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
(Ah, la, uhm, lala) Don't ... with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
Ah, la, uhm, lala
And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's stayin' at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missin' it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissin' him, how I was confused about
Now, she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing
(Ah, la, uhm, lala) Don't ... with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
(Ah, la, uhm, lala) Don't ... with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
Ah, la, uhm, lala
On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was cryin' on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
(We were stayin' on the same ... hotel floor)
And I wasn't lookin' for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singin'
(Ah, la, uhm, lala) Don't ... with my love

I met you when I was a teen, but then, you were one as well
And I could play a guitar just like ringin' a bell
Sometimes I wonder, in any other summer
Could you have been my part-time lover to me listenin' to Stevie Wonder?
Under the covers where we used to lay
And ""Re: Stacks"" is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watchin' a DVD, smokin' illegal weed
Gettin' high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We'd go anywhere our minds would take us
And I'd say, ""You are beautiful without your makeup
And you don't even need to worry 'bout your weight
'Cause we can all be loved the way that God made us""
And time's the only reason that we could break up
'Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes
To get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again
Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina
'Cause I ain't ever comin' home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now? (Ah, la, uhm, lala)
And I've been livin' on the road, Nina
But then again, you should know, Nina
'Cause that's you and me both, Nina

But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Baby, I just want to dance
I met her off Grafton Street, outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance
Played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Baby, I just want to dance
My pretty little Galway girl
Galway girl
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
Last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Cèilidh singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet
Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
She fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Baby, I just want to dance
My pretty little Galway girl
My, my, my, my, my Galway girl
My, my, my, my, my Galway girl
My, my, my, my, my Galway girl
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
Finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
You're gonna sing the chorus right now, here we go
Played the fiddle in an (Irish band)

Ten thousand rocks on the lake
Scream it out!

If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

I have travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you, no one
What's your history?
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'Cause I heard you do, mm
Or I could fall or I could fly

Combinations 'cause my passcode had changed
Opened up and saw familiar names

Conversations with my dead friends
Messages from all my exes

In the past, where it belongs
I feel an overwhelming sadness
Of all the friends I do not have left
Seeing how my family has fractured
Growin' up and movin' on

Arguments that I tried to keep at bay
The ones who loved me, I just pushed them away

I say the words that make you blush

See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists

On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young, I know my brother's gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never been anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah
The game's over, but now, I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows
But I haven't got a house, plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out
Wow, from day one, I've been prepared
With VO5 wax for my ginger hair
So now, I'm back to the sofa
Giving a dose of what the future holds 'cause it's another day

Into another rapper's shoes using new laces

She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room

After dancing to Cèilidh singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet
A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat

I wonder if he's proud or thinks that his best friend lost his way
Keep it together for my daughters, gotta come natural, I don't wanna force it
If it's not factual, don't support it, every year, gotta re-swim these waters
Draw a line, for the sake of all your family and friends
Draw a line, so history doesn't happen again
Draw a line, for the day to start the night has to end
Draw a line, for all of these ghosts
I'm too high to fly this plane, too fucked to drive this Range
Can't remember the last time I was on my own without Kev, it's kinda strange
Not been the same since 19, now to push Ly on a swing, I gotta wear disguises
I'm up for tradin' life sometimes, and that may surprise 'em
Every stadium, I played it, but I would still do it for free
Gotta keep standards, top of the top of the tree, press still got problems with me
And when school starts, I might peace out, 'til then I keep chasin' the dream
I could end it, but I don't wanna reach out 'cause he means nothin' to me
Don't worry 'bout what I make, don't trip them up to win this race
When your career's in a risky place, everything seems like a big mistake
I'm still lookin' for shit to say, deludin' myself that they still relate
Depression, I keep at bay, tomorrow's a different day
Me and that guy don't speak no more, I know why, but he's not sure, so what is the reason for
My heart's been broke so many times by loved ones that I don't ever feel like talkin'
So heed that warning, circle keeps gettin' smaller
All I need is Chez and my daughters and a few friends to help me
Draw a line, for the sake of your little girls and their time
Draw a line, but allow yourself some moments to cry
Draw a line, and leave the past that hurt you behind
Draw a line, for all of these ghosts
Draw a line, be grateful that you've been where you've been
Draw a line, recognise the path that happened between
Draw a line, there's future here, that's yet to be seen
Draw a line

She said, ""Don't you worry, if I disappear""
I told her, ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble could wait
But then I jumped right in, a week later returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late a.m.""
Baby, if you wanted me, then you should have just said
She's singing
Don't - with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't - with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
And for a couple of weeks, I only want to see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place, and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together, and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
But we should get on the plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now, she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing
Don't - with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't - with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (get lost)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (get lost)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying at the same f- hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realise what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing
Don't - with my love
That heart is so cold

Some things are broken when you open the box
So stop this, you've come too far, enough is enough
I wish I didn't care this much, but I do
No one knows the half of it, what you put me through
And I, I sometimes wonder, do you live with regret
Wish I could say I wish you the best
'Cause I used to love you
Now every day I hate you just a little more
Life got better when I lost you
But every day, I hate you just a little more and more, and more
Blame it on your history and say it's not your fault
I can't call you crazy, cause you could be diagnosed
So I used to love you, but every day I
Hate you just a little more, more, more
I wish that you would look in the mirror, 'cause if you did
You see the problem is you 'cause you're a prick
I know that I'm your scapegoat whenever the rain falls
Whenever you slip or when you're in a dip
I was there to lean on when I was a kid
But now that I'm an adult, I see it for what it is
I have to lock the door now, fuck building a bridge
Take all your apologies and put them in the bin
For your dad's sake, please move out your dad's place
Stop bringing drama there with your mates
Your sister's got enough to manage on her plate
To worry about you controlling your rage
One day we all be dead
But between now and then
I never want to see you again

The stones have been cleared around the fishermen's hut
And the air bites, then leaves almost invisible cuts
On the skin
A lighthouse retired, but a new one was hired
About 20 foot taller, painted in black and white
Twenty million steps with a computer inside
Instead of him
Only one road sign
Tellin' cars to slow down
And a long drop in the ocean
Beware of the rip tide
Broken glass and train lines
It's a new day and this is England
Next to the pub with the flag that's workin' flexible hours
'Cause there's a mismatch of carriages, soil in a boat for some flowers
Fairy lights on a building that's supplyin' us power
From the sea
Electricity lines flow like veins to the town
In-between, there is nothin' but grass and pebbles on the ground
Do not enter the wild here if you want to be found
For the free
View the flame of sunrise
Cut in half by the sky
And the empty of the desert
Team of birds that swerve by
And then land on the wire
It's a new day and this is England
When it's time to escape from the heavy of this
There is nothin' like washin' away
I find this country of mine gets a bad reputation
Of bein' cold and grey
But on the coast of the south, to the east followed 'round
I find serenity I've never felt
There's a peace and a quiet in this island of ours
That can't be mirrored by anywhere else
Homes protruding from stones with their wood coloured black
Scattered cars in a line, steam risin' out the shack
One door at the front and then just glass out the back
For the view
And the blue is so bright
You'll need shades for your eyes
And a cable to pull over
Take a walk and feel like
Everything will be fine
It's a new day and this is England",https://open.spotify.com/track/4OZoyD5m8Mrc0CMsAxBCU6

Haven't seen you in so long

And I could play a guitar just like ringing a bell
Sometimes I wonder, in any other summer
Could you have been my part-time lover to me listening to Stevie Wonder?
Under the covers where we used to lay
And ""re: Stacks"" is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watching a DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We'd use each other's air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We go anywhere our minds would take us
And I'll say, ""You are beautiful without your make-up
And you don't even need to worry about your weight 'cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us""
And time's the only reason that we could break up
'Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes
To get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again
Oh, Nina, you should go, Nina
'Cause I ain't ever coming home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been living on the road, Nina
But then again, you should know, Nina
'Cause that's you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?
And every weekend in the winter, you'd be wearing my hoodie
With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own
'Cause every day when I was away, we'd only speak on the phone
Watching ""Blue Planet"", creating new habits
Acting as if we were two rabbits, and then you'd vanish
Back to the burrow with all the Celtics
I disappear, you call me selfish, I understand, but I can't help it
I put my job over everything, except my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever, so I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation 'cause mixing business and feelings
Will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break
Just reevaluate quick before we make a mistake, and it's too late
So we can either deal with pain or wait to get on a plane
But in a day, we'll have to say it again
Oh, Nina, you should go, Nina
'Cause I ain't ever coming home, Nina

I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know
You'll find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm, prisoner with a vision
Signed to a label but didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew, but you didn't, so perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system, and you could say that I'm driven
And now it's onto the next saga, we drink the best lager
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather
I do my own thing now and get respect after
And I'm avoiding the 'cain like it was Get Carter
For four years, I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paper weight
At 16 years old, yeah, I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray, I tried to say goodbye and I choked

Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love

I take it back with the rhythm and blues

Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school
I make a beat with my feet by just hitting the loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes
I give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again, that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering, ""Everything that happens is from now on""
I'll be ready to start again by the end of the song
And still they're claiming that I handle it wrong
But then I've never had an enemy except the NME
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me
And festival fees are healthier than a Dalmatian on pedigree
Singing for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic
I'm battling for respect and I don't know if I have it
This song's from the heart, cover the planet
I'll take it back now
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No
And take it back now
Now, I don't ever wanna be perfect
'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone's got to win worst-dressed
Taken my first steps into the scene giving me focus
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change, thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition
'Cause every day some lyrics and a melody can be written
Now, absence can make your heart ache
But drinking Absinthe can change your mind state
Vividly, need to let my liver be
And I'll say it again, living life on the edge with a close handful of friends
Is good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
'Cause that how it's supposed to be
I'm screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams
But, but I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely
You'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint with McDaid, discussing records we made
And every single second knowing that we'll never betray
The way we were raised, remembering our background, sat down
That's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us

And it takes a toll, yeah
The conversation won't end
Being a rock for your friends
Cracks in the surface don't mend
We only break, we don't bend
And you'd think it was so clear
But I can't see nothing but the fear
I'm feeling so bloated
Thinking a salad won't do
Might as well open up two
Locking myself in my room
Hoping that this all ends soon
And no one will notice
What I will put myself through
'Cause they will hate themselves too
Isn't it mad what we do?
Pretending to win, but just lose
And it's so far from near
Why the hell am I still here?
This is not the end of our lives
This is just a bump in the ride
And I know that it will be alright
If it's not, then we're fucked, aren't we?
I can't help myself but cry
Every time that I realise
Maybe I'll never find my smile
But who's to blame? Well, that's on me
Well, that's on me
Well, that's on me
Too many things on my mind
To process moments of life
That some days I lose my drive
And some can't control the fire
I'm aware that things take time
But I'm not a patient guy
Maybe if I wait, I'll find
Resemblance of peace of mind
But this is just getting older
Running away from our past
Knowing the calm, it won't last
Being a mouse in this grass
Feeling the snakes behind us, and
I'm searching for closure
But nothing is healing these scars
When I open up, they just laugh
Saying if they had just half
Then nothing would ever be dark
Is it ""new me, new year""
Or just the same old blue sphere?
This is not the end of our lives
This is just a bump in the ride
And I know that it will be alright
If it's not, then we're fucked, aren't we?
I can't help myself but cry
Every time that I realise
Maybe I'll never find my smile
But who's to blame? Well, that's on me

The stones have been cleared around the fishermen's hut
And the air bites, then leaves, almost invisible cuts on the skin
A lighthouse retired, but a new one was hired
About 20 foots taller, painted in black and white
20 million steps with a computer inside instead of him
Only one road sign tellin' cars to slow down
And a long drop in the ocean
Beware of the riptide, broken glass and train lines
It's a new day, and this is England
Next to the pub with the flag that's workin' flexible hours
There's a mismatch of carriages soil in a boat for some flowers
Fairy lights on a building that's supplyin' us power from the sea
Electricity lines flow like veins to the town
In-between, there is nothin' but grass and pebbles on the ground
Do not enter the wild here if you want to be found for the free
View the flame of sunrise, cut in half by the sky
And the empty of the desert
Team of birds that swerve by, and then land on the wire
It's a new day, and this is England
When it's time to escape from the heavy of this
There is nothin' like washin' away
I find this country of mine gets a bad reputation
Of bein' cold and gray
From the Coast of the South to the East followed 'round
I find serenity I've never felt
There's a peace and a quiet in this island of ours
Can't be mirrored by anywhere else
Homes protruding from stones with their wood-coloured black
Scattered cars in a line, steam risin' out the shaft
One door at the front, and then just glass out the back for the view
And the blue is so bright, you'll need shades for your eyes
And a cable to pull over
Take a walk and feel like everything will be fine

They'd turn around like grass upon the wheel
Like grass upon the wheel
Well, I get lost inside my head
In this chaos, you're my calm
And I will find my feet again
'Cause even the worst days of my life will always end
At midnight in your arms
At midnight in your arms
Sorry I missed your call
It was silent for the song
Let me know when you're free to talk
I won't miss it for the world, no, I won't
I could not wish for more in life
Than just a hint of when you smile
I could go blind, and I'd still know your scent whenever you'd appear
I have moments when I doubt myself
But feeling low should still be felt
It's natural to be consumed with unrelenting fear
With unrelenting fear
I worry 'til there's nothing left
But in this darkness, you're my sun
And I will find my feet again
'Cause even the worst days of my life will always end

I can't get away from this rain
I'm starting to think that it's me, and
I wanna just create things
But the longer it takes, I feel drained
Can't remember a day I've been sober
Not in a place to take blame
Any more weight, I might break
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Guess we all go the same way
I'm in a bit of a mess here
Count to ten and hope to disappear
I never did my homework
Could I have been more than this?
Finding a way to exist
Within a world with no risk
Forcing a shoe that won't fit
I spend most the day stoned and
Making excuses for it
Saying it helped to write this
But, on the real, I'm tight-lipped
Shooting a shot that I'll miss
And it's so far from near
Why the hell am I still here?

This is just a bump in the ride

And if it's not, then we're fucked, aren't we?

Maybe I'll never find my smile

Well, that's on me
Well, that's on me
Now that the weather is colder
Nothing is masking this pain
The summer was here, but won't stay, and
We are inside, like, all day
Regretting the things that we say
And it takes a toll, yeah
The conversation won't end
Being a rock for your friends
Cracks in the surface don't mend
We only break, we don't bend
And you'd think it was so clear
But I can't see nothing but the fear
I'm feeling so bloated
Thinking a salad won't do
Might as well open up two
Locking myself in my room
Hoping that this all ends soon
And no one will notice
What I will put myself through
'Cause they will hate themselves too
Isn't it mad what we do?
Pretending to win, but just lose

To process moments of life
That some days I lose my drive
And some can't control the fire
I'm aware that things take time
But I'm not a patient guy
Maybe if I wait, I'll find
Resemblance of peace of mind
But this is just getting older
Running away from our past
Knowing the calm, it won't last
Being a mouse in this grass
Feeling the snakes behind us, and
I'm searching for closure
But nothing is healing these scars
When I open up, they just laugh
Saying if they had just half
Then nothing would ever be dark
Is it ""new me, new year""
Or just the same old blue sphere?
This is not the end of our lives
This is just a bump in the ride
And I know that it will be alright

I want the warmth of the summer, the cold too cold to bear
The only plus is the sweater, I need it

If they were here, then I guess I wouldn't be alone
This is the life in the city and that's the way it goes

The stones have been cleared around the fishermen's hut
And the air bites, then leaves almost invisible cuts
On the skin
A lighthouse retired, but a new one was hired
About 20 foot taller, painted in black and white
Twenty million steps with a computer inside
Instead of him
Only one road sign
Tellin' cars to slow down
And a long drop in the ocean
Beware of the rip tide
Broken glass and train lines
It's a new day and this is England
Next to the pub with the flag that's workin' flexible hours
'Cause there's a mismatch of carriages, soil in a boat for some flowers
Fairy lights on a building that's supplyin' us power
From the sea
Electricity lines flow like veins to the town
In-between, there is nothin' but grass and pebbles on the ground
Do not enter the wild here if you want to be found
For the free
View the flame of sunrise
Cut in half by the sky
And the empty of the desert
Team of birds that swerve by
And then land on the wire
It's a new day and this is England
When it's time to escape from the heavy of this
There is nothin' like washin' away
I find this country of mine gets a bad reputation
Of bein' cold and grey
But on the coast of the south, to the east followed 'round
I find serenity I've never felt
There's a peace and a quiet in this island of ours
That can't be mirrored by anywhere else
Homes protruding from stones with their wood coloured black
Scattered cars in a line, steam risin' out the shack
One door at the front and then just glass out the back
For the view
And the blue is so bright
You'll need shades for your eyes
And a cable to pull over
Take a walk and feel like
Everything will be fine

Just wish you'd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks at least before you'd let him take you
I stayed true
I kind of knew you liked the dude from private school
He's waiting for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
He's not the right guy for you
Don't hate me 'cause I write the truth
No, I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
But f- it
I won't be changin' the subject, I love it
I'll make your little secret public, it's nothing
I'm just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet
To get back at me
Trapped and I'm lackin' sleep
Fact is, you're mad at me because I backtrack so casually
You're practically my family
If we married, then I'll guess you'd have to be
But tragically, our love just lost the will to live
But would I kill to give it one more shot?
I think not

You promised your body but I'm away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
I'm not cut out for life on the road
'Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much
And at the time we'd just go
So sue me
I guess I'm not the man that you need
Ever since you went to uni
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
That's when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know it's hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad and he
Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need
I guess I'm unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one there to share it with
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you, no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you, no

And since you left I've given up my days off
It's what I need to stay strong
I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7
I feel like writing a book
I guess I lied in the hook
'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could
The irony is if my career and music didn't exist
In six years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And lighting a spliff
I'll fall into a spiral and it's
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill
And I'll be writing my will before I'm 27
I'll die from a thrill
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge
Or did I make a mistake erasing?
It's only therapy
My thoughts just get ahead of me
Eventually I'll be fine, I know that it was never meant to be
Either way I guess I'm not prepared but I'll say this

And it's comin' around, around, around, around, around
I don't wanna miss one thing
We can turn the whole world down
And listen to the in-between
We are, we are the sound
There's nothing but the space we're in
The hurry and the noise shut out
Just stay here and be right now
♪
The shadows cling to the ceiling
And fracture the light
That lands in our eyes
Every moment changes the whole view
And just when it ends
I feel it again, again, again, again, again
I don't wanna miss one thing
We can turn the whole world down
And listen to the in-between
We are, we are the sound
There's nothing but the space we're in
The hurry and the noise shut out
Just stay here and be right now
Nothing else matters

Don't,x (10th Anniversary Edition),https://open.spotify.com/album/1upLfaShcnjVjey0FdY7aO,2024,3:39,"844,339,247","I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry, if I disappear""
I told her, ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble could wait
But then I jumped right in, a week later returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late a.m.""
Baby, if you wanted me, then you should have just said
She's singing
Don't - with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't - with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
And for a couple of weeks, I only want to see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place, and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together, and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
But we should get on the plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now, she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing
Don't - with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't - with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (get lost)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (get lost)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying at the same f- hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realise what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing
Don't - with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't - with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't - with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't - with my love

But how can I help myself?
Been inside for most this year
And I thought a few drinks, they might help
It's been a while, my dear
Dealin' with the cards life dealt
I'm still holdin' back these tears
While my friends are somewhere else
I pictured this year a little bit different
When it hit February
I step in the bar, it hit me so hard
Oh, how can it be this heavy?
Every song reminds me you're gone
And I feel the lump form in my throat
'Cause I'm here alone
Just dancin' with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you
And time is movin' so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancin' with my
Eyes, eyes closed
Eyes, so I'll keep dancin' with my-
Delusion is here again
And I think you'll come home soon
A word brings me right back in
Then it's only me that's in this room
I guess I could just pretend
The colours are more than blue
But I lost more than my friend
I can't help but missin' you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I pictured this month a little bit different
No one is ever ready
And when it unfolds, you get in a hole
Oh, how can it be this heavy?
Everything changes, nothing's the same
Except the truth is now you're gone
And life just goes on
So I'm dancin' with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you
And time is movin' so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancin' with my
Eyes, eyes closed
Eyes, so I'll keep dancin' with my
Eyes, eyes closed
Eyes, oh, I keep dancin' with my-
They're shutting the bar, they're cleanin' the floor
And everyone is already home, but I'm on my own
Still dancin' with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you
And time is movin' so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do

Forever changing, we make life interesting
Some days we're red, and some days we both think green
But I like the nights when we leave the canvas free
Grab a brush, and see where the feeling may lead
Nothing is out of our reach
Our words are mixing the pigment we need
Can we get started?
I keep falling
Deeper in dark blue
Brighter than white
Rainbows exploding
But I can't see nothing
Except you and your eyes
Maybe, we'll just paint the night colourblind
In every spectrum, we find the millionth piece
Connect the dots and everything in between, mmm
Dull in the moment, you'll turn it golden leaf

It's been weeks since I saw your outline
In my room is a silence so loud
This is what losing hope might sound like
Put me down so I'm in my place
Say it's over for breathing space
All I was, was a route to change
Is this just growing up?
I might seem too distracted right now
It's been so long I've been the punchline
I stand naked while these clothes dry out
Leave me drowning to edit the runtime
Put me down so I'm in my place
Say it's over for breathing space
All I was, was a route to change
Is this just growing up?
All this love cannot seal my fate
Low is all that I've been of late
Caught in webs I wove with my mistakes
But this is growing up
I can't help it, but I love you so, I can't take this letting go
I still feel that we could work it out or something
All I am is only flesh and bone, why's your heart so freezing cold?
