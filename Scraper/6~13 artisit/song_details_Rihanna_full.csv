Fool In Love,Talk That Talk (Deluxe),https://open.spotify.com/album/3sW7wD2qdMjs7KncaOoIJ5,2012,4:15,"15,590,231","Mama, I found a man
Who loves me and understands
Papa, he's quite a man
He adores me, he's my biggest fan
And don't get me wrong
I know he's not perfect in your eyes
But somehow he's flawless in mine
And you may tell me to run, run now
But I can't do that
We're too far down the hole
He's got a hole on my soul
So I guess I'm a fool
I'm a fool in love
But I'm willin' to stay here
And bask in the glory of his heart
I guess I'm a fool in love
But I'm willin' to look so stupid
'Til i've had enough
Mama, don't judge me now
I'm not trying to hurt you
I know this won't make you proud
Papa, did I let you down?
Are you ashamed of how your little girl turned out?
You'll see a monster
I see a smile
You say it's danger
And I'm in denial
But somehow I feel so safe right now
So I guess I'm a fool
I'm a fool in love
But I'm willin' to stay here
And bask in the glory of his heart
I guess I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to look so stupid

I can't even sleep at night
I can't get it off my mind

I end up behind bars

Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry

When she fits right down in my shoes
What do you expect me to do
If you're playin' me for a fool
I will lose my cool
And reach for my firearm
I didn't mean to lay him down
But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking
Now he's no longer living

You can see it through my chest
And I'm terrified but I'm not leaving

""How could you let us down?""
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way 'round
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
One by one, every trait
I tried but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
When I breathe in too deep
Going with what I always longed for
Feel like a brand new person (but you make the same ol' mistakes)
Well, I don't care, I'm in love (stop before it's too late, I know)
Feel like a brand new person (but you make the same ol' mistakes)
I finally know what it's like (you don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it's too late)
(I know there's too much at stake)
Making the same mistakes (and I still don't know why it's happening)
Stop while it's not too late (and I still don't know)
Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
Point is I have the right
Not thinking in black and white
Thinking it's worth the fight
Soon to be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for
Feel like a brand new person (but you make the same ol' mistakes)
Well, I don't care, I'm in love (stop before it's too late, I know)
Feel like a brand new person (but you make the same ol' mistakes)
So how do I know that it's right? (You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it's too late)
And I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe your story ain't so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons and she's got her regrets
And I know that it's hard to digest
A realization is as good as a guess
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons and she's got her regrets
But you've got your demons and she's got her regrets
Feel like a brand new person
So how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So, how will I know I've gone too far?
Stop thinking you're the only option, oh
Feel like a brand new person (but you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like (stop before it's too late)
Stop thinking you're the only option
In a new direction (but you make the same old mistakes)
So, how will I know I've gone too far? (You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it's too late)
Stop thinking you're the only option
Feel like a brand new person (but you make the same old mistakes)
And I don't know how to describe (stop before it's too late)
Stop thinking you're the only option
(But you make the same old mistakes)
(You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it's too late)

This feels like, so unreal (oh, oh)
I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
And I'm aggressive, just one thought ain't close enough
You got me stressing, incessantly pressing the issue
'Cause every moment gone you know I miss you
I'm the question, and you're of course the answer
Just hold me close, boy, 'cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken up, never mistaken
But I can't control myself, got me calling out for help

I can't take it, see it don't feel right

Love is testing me, but still I'm losing it
This time, please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it

Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it

Yes, it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity
My tummy's up in knots, and when I see you, it gets so hot
My common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock
Take on me (uh-huh), you know inside you feel it right
Take me on, I could just die up in your arms tonight
I melt with you, you got me head over heels (over heels)

And, boy, your love's enough with words unspoken
I said, boy, I'm telling you, you got me open

We fly higher than weather
And she flies it better
You know me, in anticipation for precipitation
Stack chips for the rainy day
Jay, Rain Man is back with Little Miss Sunshine
Rihanna, where you at?
You had my heart, and we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines, but you'll still be my star
Baby 'cause in the dark, you can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share
Because when the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella

When the world has dealt its cards

Goodbye
No, baby
Oh, silly me, I believed in your fairytales
Boy, I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride, all the tears that I cried
And it cuts like a knife
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips (ever gonna kiss these lips)
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy, it's the last time (It's the last time)
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies (never gonna hear your lies)
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time
There's no time to give it one more try
Ain't a thing you can do but wonder why
There's only time to say goodbye
Baby, goodbye
Cause I'm never gonna
Never gonna cry no more

Goodbye, goodbye
