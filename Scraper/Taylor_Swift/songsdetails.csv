But it's precious, adorable
Like a toy chihuahua barking at me from a tiny purse
That's how much it hurts
How many times has your boyfriend said
""Why are we always talking 'bout her?""
It's actually sweet
All the time you've spent on me
It's honestly wild
All the effort you've put in
It's actually romantic
I really gotta hand it to you, ooh
No man has ever loved me like you do
You think I'm tacky, baby
Stop talking dirty to me
It sounded nasty, but it
Feels like you're flirting with me
I mind my business, God's my witness that I don't provoke it
It's kind of making me wet (oh)
'Cause it's actually sweet
All the time you've spent on me

Were you just too smug for your own good?
Or bring a tiny violin to a knife fight?

They believed I was innocent

Then just be better at it
Everyone's got bodies in the attic
Or took somebody's man
We'll take you by the hand

Of never getting caught

Is a lot more sharp

Looking back I guess it was kismet
I waited by the stage door
Packed in with the autograph hounds
Barking her name
Then glowing like the end of a cigarette
Wow, she came out
I said, ""You're living my dream""
Then she said to me
""Hey, thank you for the lovely bouquet
You're sweeter than a peach

She was a menace
The baby of the family in Lenox
Her father whored around like all men did
Her mother took pills and played tennis
So she waited by the stage door
As the club promoter arrived
She said, ""I'd sell my soul to have a taste of a magnificent life, that's all mine""
But that's not what showgirls get
They leave us for dead

Hung them from my neck
I paid my dues with every bruise
I knew what to expect
Do you wanna take a skate on the ice inside my veins?
They ripped me off like false lashes
And then threw me away
And all the headshots on the walls
Of the dancehall are of the bitches
Who wish I'd hurry up and die
But I'm immortal now, baby dolls
I couldn't if I tried
So I say
""Thank you for the lovely bouquet
