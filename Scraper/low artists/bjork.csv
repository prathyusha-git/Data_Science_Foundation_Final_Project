In order to survive as species
We need to define our utopia
The Paris Climate Accord is a modern utopia
Impossible to imagine
But overcoming our environmental challenges
Is the only way we can survive
We have to imagine something that doesn't exist
Carved intentionally into the future
And demand a space for hope
Weave a matriarchal dome
Let's imagine a world
Where nature and technology collaborate
And make a song about it
Let's make a musical mock-up
For our destination
And then move into it
After disasters
In all mythologies around the world
One captures the spirit
With a flute and starts anew
Carved out of the first fauna
We arrive on a new island
With mutant species
Unknown hybrids of birds and plants
Our past is on loop
Turn it off

Auminginn villtist mömmu frá.
Sífellt í hring hann synti thar,
Og sá hana ekki neins stadar.
Mamma vissi vel um thad,
Og á vængjunum sínum kom thar ad.
Ósköp gladur vard unginn thá,
Og öruggur sinni mömmu hjá.
Ef ad tjörnin okkar frys,
Uti er gaman ad sleda á ís.
Thá er oftast úti svalt,
Og aumingja bra-bra thá svo kalt,
Med kalda fætur á köldum ís,
Króknar stundum, deyr og frys.

Above us floating
An oval ovule in a dark blood-red sky
Carries our digital selves
Embracing and kissing
My skin-mud dense by you
I anchor our darks, I anchor our darks
I sleep with one eye open
Watching our sub-selves
The keel of our ship
These obstacles are just teaching us
So we can merge even deeper
Into our own personal mineral
Fuse alloy, ship ahoy
The hostility a broken heart endures
The velocity of that injury
Is returned to the world
With the same grin showing teeth
When I was a girl
I felt love was a building
I marched towards
But deadly demonic divorces demolished the ideal
Now with your romantic intelligence
The sensual tenderness
We dissolve old habits and place a glass egg
Above us floating
In a dark blood-red oval void
Our love-making avatars
In a shell",https://open.spotify.com/track/1sfP3ugtRyyr9s5C3S8iaR,240

Did I imagine it would be like this?
Was it something like this I wished for?
Or will I want more?
Lust for comfort
Suffocates the soul
Relentless restlessness
Liberates me (Sets me free)
I feel at home
Whenever the unknown surrounds me
I receive its embrace
Aboard my floating house
♪
Wanderlust relentlessly craving
Wanderlust peel off the layers
Until we get to the core

Did I imagine it would be like this?
Was it something like this I wished for?

Or will I want more?
Wanderlust from island to island
Wanderlust united in movement
Wonderful! I'm joined with you

Wanderlust - Matthew Herbert Remix,Wanderlust,https://open.spotify.com/album/4vcSmyGyXHZ6p4OnLQPrDF,2008,22238,"Giving urban a farewell
Its habitants seem to keen on God
I cannot stomach their rights and wrongs
I have lost my origin
And I don't want to find it again
Whether sailing into nature's laws
And be held by ocean's paws
Wanderlust! relentlessly craving
Wanderlust! peel off the layers
Until we get to the core
Did I imagine it would be like this?
Was it something like this I wished for?
Or will I want more?
Lust for comfort
Suffocates the soul
Relentless restlessness
Liberates me (sets me free)

Whenever the unknown surrounds me
I receive its embrace
