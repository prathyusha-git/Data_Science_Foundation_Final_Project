Carved intentionally into the future

Weave a matriarchal dome

Where nature and technology collaborate
And make a song about it
Let's make a musical mock-up
For our destination
And then move into it
After disasters
In all mythologies around the world
One captures the spirit
With a flute and starts anew
Carved out of the first fauna
