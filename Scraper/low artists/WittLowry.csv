If you let me, I'll be
Out of my dress and into your arms tonight
Yeah, I'm lost without it
Feels like I'm always waitin'
I need you to come get me
Out of my head, and into your arms tonight, tonight
Yeah, I don't mean to make you wait
Just the pressure's been gettin' heavy
I know if I fuck us up, we'll be over, done, you'll forget me
Forget me, I'm feelin' bad that I act this way, 'cause you let me
They call me king, but I know my queen will be there to check me
Last year, was runnin' 'round 45th lookin' for SoHo
Last night, was ridin' down Rodeo lookin' for no ho
It's crazy what can change in a year, think that you know though
Go back and forth like a yo-yo, they live their life for the photos
They see me, I'm actin' solo, 'cause I'm afraid to commit
Now, can you tell me how I'm different than him, and him, and him?
Yeah, I know I'm always questionin' things, like, girl
Would you say that love cannot be found inside a vow or a ring?
She laughs and says, ""Only material things
Those are material things, imagine buyin' all my trust with a ring
Imagine spendin' all my love on a fling, got a thing for you
If I had the talent you had, I probably would sing for you, like""
I'm out of my head, out of my mind, oh, I
If you let me, I'll be
Out of my dress and into your arms tonight
Yeah, I'm lost without it
Feels like I'm always waitin'
I need you to come get me
Out of my head, and into your arms tonight, tonight
Yeah, I don't mean to make you wait or to contemplate about us
My ex, she loved to lie, guess that's why it's harder to trust
I been searchin' to find myself and not get too lost into lust
I heard once that you can try, but can't fill from an empty cup
That's no lie, and all I ever say is how I need time
If it was up to you now, you would be mine
I'm on the road more than I'm home
And still I find it's only you on my mind
The last three were gemini, I take that shit as a sign, it's funny
You can't buy time with your money
And you love goin' to the beach whether it's cloudy or sunny
And you love drinkin' all your wine until it hurts in your tummy
You call me, ""Honey, I'm tipsy
And really all I want is for you to love me""
Flashbacks to backroads drivin' back to my side of state
I know I need to tell you, I care before it's too late
Before someone steps to the plate, before you decide not to wait
Before you decide not to chase, then you call me up, just to say
""I'm out of my head, out of my mind, oh, I
If you let me, I'll be
Out of my dress and into your arms tonight (oh, baby)
Yeah, I'm lost without it
Feels like I'm always waitin'
I need you to come get me (oh)
Out of my head, and into your arms tonight
Tonight"" (yeah, yeah)",https://open.spotify.com/track/0b11D9D0hMOYCIMN3OKreM,186
Kindest Regards,Kindest Regards,https://open.spotify.com/album/5Py5aOEeAsp9oz7pD30wZL,2014,67174138,"Here to tell you the truth
Tell you I'm nervous
Tell you my story
Tell you I'm worth it
Tell you my flaws and my faults and my doubts
Give you my heart and what's left of it now
Tell you my hurt, tell you my pain
Tell you the thoughts I keep trapped in my brain
Tell you that nothing's the same
Tell you I'm nothing much more than a man
And tell you I fear I may never find love
Tell you I'm getting in touch with above
And right now, can't deny that I'm scared
All this music I wrote won't compare or warrant the buzz
Alone in my room
Dissecting each line that I rhyme
I don't know how I finish on time
Miss a drop date three times
I know that I let you all down
Well, I was the first in that line, so
Sever my soul from my body, engulf it in music, then give you something to relate
This is somewhere to go when your heart becomes cold and your friends become fake
As you stand on the edge of the world, you feel like you're destined to break
And your grandma is screaming, ""You're worthless!"", and calling you names to your face
Mom and I had to move to a place second time that I'll rhyme to paint this picture
And I can't deny I would hide in my room and would cry from dealing with ya
Pictures so vivid, you yell in the kitchen
I'm taking my boxes, I've made a decision
I'm done with your dissing, your father they're fixing
I tried to be nice but you just wouldn't listen
I couldn't wait for the day just to give you my take on the shit that you did
Silly old bitch, never be like you
Never be so rude, I hope
I wish alone and sit, you sit, but this is where we end it
It's crazy to me how the truth is often most offensive, battle tested
Learned my lesson to forgive, but not forget
I spilled my heart, opened my chest
Irrelevant you are to me, but part to me, honestly
Thought I should address, life often makes this mess
I've come to give you more while everybody gives you less, yeah
And, looking back on it all was a lie
At your friend's house and there's no other guys
Surprise! Now look who you're with—I'm not trying to diss
I'm just telling you this that your feelings may fade, but your memories stick
Hope you're happy with him
I honestly hope you're happy with him
And he does all the things that I would, and I tried, but I couldn't
Could keep going on, but I know that I shouldn't
I shouldn't waste any more time
Shouldn't waste any more lines when you're drunk off the wine
Do you find me crossing your mind?
We knew this would happen with time
But I think that we finally figured it out
That we would just never work out
I tried picking you up
You tried pulling me down
But now life without you is where happy is found
And right now I'm just focused on music
Trust you would lose it
Ripped out my heart, you abused and you used it
Love's not a label on Facebook
When I gave you everything like, ""Girl, wait, look!""
But you didn't care
I would just stare at my wall
And you gave me no reason at all when you left
Picked myself up when you made me feel less
Much better off, and at that I detest
Well, now let's just put it to rest
I wish you the best
My friends don't respond to my texts
Yes, I've been busy with 'Kindest Regards'
But is it that hard just to call?
I wanna hang out yet you shutting me out
And you put in no effort at all
Now, you got me confused like, ""What did I do?""
Used to tell you if I make it, I'll be bringing all you
Now, my circles are limited
Few of y'all walked out and left
That left no one to lose
I got nothing to lose
And nothing to gain by not telling the truth
Been barely believing in love
I still really don't even know if I do
But, if someone was ever to make me believe
Then that someone is you
I promise it's you
I never took action, you're Snapchattin'
Asking me where all my music is at
We're talking right now as I'm writing this rap
You're someone I wish that I always could have
And to be blatant, girl, your name is—
Still can't say it, never could say it
Scared you would hate it
Wonder what crosses your mind when you play it
I'm patient, I'm waiting for you
Even wrote 'Rescue' about me and you
Maybe one day we'll be, we'll wait and we'll see
Now, I'm chasing my dream and I hope you do too
And I'm hoping to prove I'm paying my dues
Dad would get drunk and pass out, I'm like, ""What are you doin'?""
Booze and you lose it—he knew it
So he got sober, so proud, I knew you could do it!
I'm out at a party, ya'll tell me to drink
Here's what I think—I think you look stupid!
Sinking my soul into music, I do it for free
And just know that I'm woven into it
My fans, we turned into fam
I'm here to guide you; give me your hands
Tell me your thoughts and your dreams and your plans
They told me I never could be what I am
Now look where we stand
We stand for everything we said we'd stand for
When they tried to give us less, we said, ""No, fuck that—we demand more!""
And we stand tall
Dan told me jump on the beat and go tell 'em the truth
That's what I do, I do this for you
I tell you my story to help you get through
And you see that this life is hard
The darkest nights make the brightest stars
I'm bringing y'all with me, let's raise the bar
I know y'all come feel this, whoever you are
Kindest regards

cause i'm trying to live a dream
and it means that it seems I got no wealth
and we know hell

it looks something like a letter turning off the lights
we can't pay the price
how i am i gonna write at night with no lights
and I want it more i see you charging up a bill that you can't afford
so i pray for the day that i can say that i gave you more

you know you deserve it
and one day in the future you'll realize that one day all the pain it was worth it
and i get you that house out in Florida with gizmo that view will be perfect
you should know that i feel like you raised me alone because daddy was worthless
never was working
drunk on the couch
i'm almost ashamed that i came from you know
you finally got sober
you figured it out
but you sit and you pout
no ones ever around when i cap in the gown for sobriety found
and forget about years about you letting me down
i'm surrounded by people who care about me now

Until I'm sitting on a bill I ain't worried bout a mill now i'm hoping that I bring
it to the people, hope the used to laugh and joke, they used to push me down
I had to find my soul inside I'm lost and found would have been better of without a
dad around I know it's sad to say, but can you blame me now?
Can you blame me now?
Yelling and screaming alcohol over us what were you thinking I'm tired of watching
you drinking
I tried to be nice, okay now I'm hoping to sink in
And when there was nothing to eat I had friends who were feeding me dinner Drived
to your house, stomach would growl
open the door and, you notice that I've been getting thinner been working all winter
been losing my mind, I've been stuck in my room it analysing my lines
But me, I'm tryna get to know me
Momma working at a two jobs ot we got two things in common
We fight and believe now I'm trimming the leaves on the family tree
I don't do this for me, me I do this for we
we got passion and heart, we're apart of a ream

Somebody said I changed a lot, but honestly a lot's been changin' me
They started signin' virtual rappers, we'll have to wait and see
If there's a place for me once they dumb the art down to make-believe
The dirt sits on the Tesla and Balenciaga trainers
Just so every time I see 'em, I'm reminded where I came from
I came a long way from three digits on the paystub
To some millions dollar deals I decided to walk away from
I push my limits to the borderline
So versatile, and you only hate 'cause you're the old design
They wanna steal your soul but they can never get ahold of mine
Been workin' every night, it's like my life is stuck on overtime

But you're so stuck in your bubble, you love to hear yourself talk
And you just can't understand why I don't fit in a box
I own my masters, motherfucker, just in case you forgot
Does it hurt to know you
Don't own all those average records you've got?
You said I fell off, but your views on success are so basic
You talk a lot of shit for someone that lives in their mother's basement
Funded all this outta pocket, never took a product placement
See, success to me is winning with the people that I came with
I push my limits to the borderline
So versatile, and you only hate 'cause you're the old design

Went multiplatinum off a song that didn't even make the album
Did LaLa a cappella 'cause I couldn't get the sound on
The truth is that the journey's more important than the outcome
Look, when I leave, I hope I leave 'em better than I found 'em
And my grandpa's got dementia, so I know nobody's prayin' for me
Fucked me up when people that I trusted started changin' on me
Feelin' like a titan, seems like everybody's aimin' for me

For the first time
Listen, my heart is breakin', maybe I lack the patience
But how have all your vices now become my obligation?
With every slip you take, you change, and damn, I fuckin' hate it
I might take every bottle in this motherfuckin' house and break it
I can't take it, as you've become a slave to somethin' faceless
You always say you'll change, yeah, you always say the same shit
How could someone so wise become so equally complacent?
You're about to lose it all, do you not care enough to save it, motherfucker?
I'm sorry, damn, it's been a long day
But think about it, have you ever asked if I was okay?
You see, your problems create problems, then you drink 'em away
It's not until you sober up enough that that's when you say (hey)
I fucked up again and slept in all of my clothes
For the first time in a while (for the first time, for the first time)
I fucked up again, and blocked out, I lost all control
For the first time in a while (for the first time, for the first time)
Yeah, you wasted years gettin' wasted, I don't need your sorry, just save it
You think I can't tell you're faded? I don't mean to be so abrasive
I know you have a disease, and that you're just scared to face it
I don't mean to make this 'bout me, but can't you see why I'm jaded?
I miss the you you are when you're sober, you've added years to your face
And not just because you're gettin' older, but 'cause you drank and you drank
It feels like the world's on your shoulders, you carry all of its weight
And the doctor said you're bipolar, you think there's been a mistake
And I know, I'm not your brain, it's not my place to tell you what is real
All that I can do is try to tell you how I fuckin' feel
Stuck by you through it all, I don't ever question if I love you still
The greatest gift that you could ever give me is to fuckin' heal
I never would've thought you'd let the liquor run your life
You drink when everything is wrong, you drink when everything is right
Not here to downplay all your pain or all the demons that you fight
But over family and friends, how could you pick a vodka sprite?
Another night and another lie, you try to hide it, I can tell
You're drunk again, 'cause on your breath, the alcohol is all I smell
We only have this life to live, why would you choose to live in hell?
If you won't get sober for me, at least just do it for yourself
Damn, I feel you fadin' away
I never let you hit rock bottom, maybe that's what it takes
For you to finally put the bottle down before it's too late
It's not until you sober up enough that that's when you say (hey)
I fucked up again and slept in all of my clothes
For the first time in a while (for the first time, for the first time)

Did you lose your heart in the darkness, deep in your pocket?
No, I don't care of the price I'd pay
I don't wanna spend my life that way
Tell me is the pain that you're causin' worth what you profit?
Yeah, they say that money don't buy happiness, just beautiful things
But I wouldn't mind the extra time and piece of mind that it brings
I wouldn't mind if I could afford AC in the spring
Or for the heat in the winter,
Not being bitter but they live like kings
And here we are in one bedroom we could barely afford
Hang your sheets up on the walls just to mimic the doors
Can barely afford to pay for a Ford, why you pay for your Porsche?
See, where I'm from nobody makes it to Forbes
And I'm so tired of this dead-end job
While I was workin' last night, my fuckin' car got robbed
There's glass everywhere, I'm searchin' for the things I lost
All the things I bought
You steal from me just to cut your cost
My mom's worked her whole life just to get me a life to live
So I spilled my fuckin' soul and gave everything I could give
I think we can agree that Sallie Mae is a bitch
And there's gotta be more to life than this
Why do you let us—
Why do you let us hate one another just for the dollar?
Did you lose your heart in the darkness, deep in your pocket?
No, I don't care of the price I'd pay
I don't wanna spend my life that way
Tell me is the pain that you're causin' worth what you profit?
Yeah, another day, another bill, lately hatin' how I feel
Need a tax refund just to buy a fuckin' meal
Your follows on your social's essential for signin' deals
Man, it's crazy how a fake affects a room full of real
My boss told me, ""Turn tables,"" I told him, ""Tables will turn""
What I'm laughin' at: What I make in a day is more than you earn
The waiters start to laugh like to mention that is absurd
But they never focus their vision, their vision focus is blurred
And they think I'm out of my mind, or ahead of my time
Or I'm the one that grinds and puts himself on the line
To learn how to win, you have to lose a hundred times
Honestly, I think that losin' is better than not tryin'
They say, ""Make money, don't let the money make you""
The question is, what if it's the only thing to save you?
Would you sell your soul for a price if they paid you?
Or would you keep it real and stay you?
Why do you let us—
Why do you let us hate one another just for the dollar?
Did you lose your heart in the darkness, deep in your pocket?
No, I don't care of the price I'd pay
I don't wanna spend my life that way
Tell me is the pain that you're causin' worth what you profit?
Yeah, I know that money don't buy
Happiness, but buys you more material shit
Then rewordin' how I think and what it means to be rich
I used to think it meant to flex a Rolex on my wrist
Feels bad to take more than you give, lately, hate how we live
I never want become the face that I hate
When the man in the mirror will laugh and spit in my face
And tell me that the money has made me another fake
I've been drownin' in my mind and my money's been addin' weight
Oh Lord, oh Lord, please save me
I should have known that somethin' man-made couldn't make me
I say I'm makin' music, or is music what creates me?
I never have an answer, same question every day
See, when we pass on, all our things are passed on to the next

I hate it when you're here but you're not here
Hate it when your friends turn to old peers
Hate it when you talk but you don't hear
Hate it when your energy feels weird
Last time I think I laughed, it was last year
Made more money last month than the past year
When everything feels fake, only facts here
I remember working back as a cashier, simpler times
Now it's been three weeks, still the page is empty
They hang on every word I fuckin' say
While I appreciate you, wait for my perspective
Gotta keep it real, there's somethin' else in play
Somethin' I can't explain, yeah
Like the lyrics I find in my mind were put in my brain, damn
Is it really that deep? Maybe it's me
Then one day, I came across what the Romans believed
And even the Greek
You see, they believe we create from our Genii
It's not in our genes, that got me to think
'Bout rappers who claim that they're more than just human
Promote what they pour in their drink
Was makin' me think, I needed a substance to create
With somethin' that wasn't in me
But pardon me, please
Fuck all that nonsense
I believe that my music is bigger than me
If I'm bein' honest
And I think that it's lame for an artist
To claim they're a god or a goddess
Because that type of thinkin' is silently killing off all of our artists
While the industry profit, fillin' their wallets, damn
Feel like I'm on a hamster wheel
While I focus on makin' the music
You don't need your hands to feel
Is it fair when we follow our passion
We barely can land a meal?
In an industry where they can take
They don't need hands to steal!
They told me, ""Go get a degree!""
Was stupid for followin' dreams
Your job was to push me to think
Instead you're just hurdling sheep
I spill out my soul into ink
I told 'em I need to pursue what I love
If not, then I'm makin' this money for what?
Buy shit from a brand led by someone that does
I needed to find out who I really was, now...
They would never get it
Said I couldn't do it, so they were shook when I did it
They never could see the vision, they never wanted me winnin'
I never need an opinion, I never was one to fit it
Too fast to follow along, then I'll bring it back in a minute
I take the beat for a trip and I'll bring it back when I'm finished
I see my room as a womb, and I build and grow while I'm in it
I'm livin', but am I livin'? I can't even tell the difference
Since the last four lines, it's been about one week
Anxiety hit me real hard, and I think
I've been sacrificin' my own mental to prove
The potential in me with the music they seek
'Cause the more that I'm makin', the more that they need
The more that I'm open, the more that I bleed
The more that they're lyin', the less I believe

I been back and forth, daily
Am I even making art, or did the art make me?
No wonder why I'm feelin' lost lately
Do they hate the art, or do they really hate me?
They're so negative on the daily
But I don't need your help, to me I'm twice as mean
Yeah, I'm twice as mean, it's seemin' like your dream
Is really only takin' shots at my self-esteem, mo'fucker!
You question why you should care
Like, ""This don't affect what I do""
But maybe, just maybe, if you change your thinkin'
Then you would find you'd start believin' in you
You see, as a human, you're made to create
Not just sit at a desk with some paper and glue
And maybe, just maybe, we do have a genius
So all of the blame and the praise is for two, damn

It's been a while since I've seen your pretty face
Yeah just always know these other girls will never replace
Yeah I'm wasting all my time on all these girls that don't mean nothing
Thinking way back to that summer, oo I knew you felt that something
You can't tell me there was nothing in this crush the longest one I've ever had

Cause you've been through a hailstorm
I feel like me and you could weather this weather

I hope you hear this so you know just how I feel about you
Too scared to tell you how I feel but always wished that you knew
And now I'm stuck here writing songs and all these songs are to prove
Do you ever miss me?
Remember last summer when you kissed me?
Honestly that night was the best
Yeah, but I think we'd agree that night was a mess
You see now at the time I had this friend that really liked you
And was talking to this girl that would do anything to spite you
Due to them, I never made a move
That was my mistake because they showed me what it's like to get walked on and be betrayed
Now I'm sitting on this train just thinking 'bout you and me

An idle mind is where the demons roam
Last night I met fear, doubt, hurt, hate, pain
Told me, ""If you don't change, then we don't go""
They'll give us life, and then we don't grow
They've got me thinking, ""Am I really in control now?""
This whole town doesn't really feel like home now
My family been sayin', ""Mark, you gotta slow it down""
Out on a date, she say, ""You really on your phone?""
""Wow,"" livin' through my phone now
I've been feelin' disconnected
Everyone around me, they would never get it
Do they love me 'cause I'm hurtin' or they get the message?
Only love me when I'm workin' 'cause they want percentage
I remember late night writin' here to tell you the truth
Back when I was too broke, servin' tables just to pay for a booth
Back when really, I had nothin' to lose
Back when—ugh! Fuck it, brace yourself for the news
Last year I saw my dad pass away right in front of my eyes
A couple fake friends showed me who they were in disguise
My ex-girl told me nothing but lies
So maybe I was just in love with who she was in my mind
I been lost inside my mind lately
I been losing track of time lately
It's like I barely know who I'm lately
I been prayin' for a sign lately
I been yellin' at the sky lately
My only question now is ""Why?"" lately
Why is it I'm weak if I show the people I feel?
And why is it they told me that time is all that can heal?
And in time who needs to heal me? Been searchin' for somethin' real
And I know that we attracted the energy that we deal
I been overthinkin', overthinkin'
And nowadays I find 'em over drinkin' on a weekend
The people yellin', ""Where is Mark? 'Cause we fuckin' need him!""
See, this is somewhere you can go when you feel like there's nothin' else to believe in
I never could plan the doubt, I never could plan the pain
I never could plan the number where people screamin' our name
I never could plan the love, I never could plan the hate
I never could plan the love would turn into hate when it's fake
I never could plan the fear, I never could plan the hurt
I never could plan that I will be helpin' people with words
I never could plan a heart that was put inside of my chest

Don't mean the edited one for the 'Gram
But I mean the one who needs love, has fear and doubt
And only comes out around fam
See, I'm just a man, I bleed and it's red
Been tryin' to quiet the voice in my head
Too weak to repeat all the things that it says
You're destined to slip when you live on the edge
And I'm doin' my best, but it's never enough
It's always, ""Hey, when you gon' follow this up?""
I give 'em so much of myself, my art, my soul
There isn't much left in my cup
Not prayin' enough, don't know who to trust
Don't follow for follow, I follow my gut
There is no more room for discourse anymore
It's: ""I'm right and you're wrong, and agree or shut up""
What in the fuck? When will we learn?
Together we grow, and divided we burn
There's over seven billion of us on Earth
And here I am talkin' 'bout puttin' me first
And all of my hurt, like anyone cares
I have a tendency to overshare
Crazy to look at a sea full of people
And still feel like there isn't anyone there
As everyone stares, I swear that I'm fine
Tears streamin' outta both of my eyes
They love to see all this raw and real emotion
So they can upload it online
This story is mine, they took and rewrote it
They'll do anything for a click and they post it
But never with credit, my art has been lessened to trends
While people pretend like they own it
Okay, duly noted, things change in due time
Things that I wanted all losin' their shine
Now all I want is to text, or to talk to my dad
But know I'll never get a reply
And that weighs on my mind, not tryin' to harp
But I have to live with this hole in my heart
And maybe the only real way that I know how to cope
Is by losin' myself in the art
I said things that were harsh and I never meant
I let discontent really mess with my head
So many things that I wish I had done and had said
Before I never saw him again
Time that I make amends and pull back the curtain
I barely was there, even when he was hurtin'
And I think of that, I think, ""Damn, what a terrible son""
And I question myself as a person
A human still learnin'
Huh
Just a human still learnin' (uh-uh)
Know I'll never be perfect
That's the only thing certain, yeah
Someone mentioned the music was savin' their life, they relate to it so much it hurts
And I thought to myself, ""I'm so glad I could help, but it's you who put in all the work""
So don't give me credit 'cause I'm just a human who loses himself in his words
I wonder if Steve ever thought that one day we'd be treatin' an app like a church
And hold up these content creators and athletes and artists as if they were gods
Until we decide they no longer have value, then they're thrown away and forgot
See, honestly, all that we are is a sum of our vices, our fears, and our flaws
And then at the end, we end up in a box and can't bring anything that we bought
All the things that we're not make us who we are
Nobody thought I would make it this far
Used to shoot for the sky 'til I realized that it had been proven
That humans are made out of stars
I spill out my heart, it's all that I know
Never been good at just lettin' shit go
Do you know how it feels to sink all that you have in your craft
And still feel like there's nothin' to show?
This here is a poem, a letter, a song
I don't know where in the fuck I belong
There's nothin' more lonely than bein' surrounded by people
Yet all of your people are wrong
I feel like a pawn, I feel like I'm trapped
There's people I miss I can never get back
But been learnin' that life's not about how much water we have
It's about how we look at the glass, that's a lot to unpack, yeah
Dan said, ""Jump on a track, give 'em all that you have,"" yeah
Ever since, I don't know what it's like to hold back, yeah
When the story's authentic, you don't need to act, yeah
Never needed to act, yeah
There's concepts I need to explore, and feelings I can't just ignore

I just heard that my old girl got somebody new and is pregnant
I spent my time just forgettin'
I spent my time on the music and travel the country
Those last couple lines, I've been said it
Last night I took a ride around my old town
Was the last time I felt somethin' for the first time
I took a ride by my old house
'Cause that's where I fell in love for the first time
Thinkin' back, December when I saved every penny that I made
Knew I'd be the greatest, I just gotta find a way
I couldn't even buy food from the place that I work
'Cause the food cost more than the pay that I made
And they told me I would never be shit
Run around in town, ""Am I meant to be shit?""
Always had a vision, and they never see shit
Wrote my first line, Witty is the meanest
So there back, get some receipt, people, while I work at the movies
Girls hit me up, now used to look through me
Sayin' I'll change, yeah, you never knew me
But maybe they're right, I just hope I don't lose me, now I'm
Wishin' I could rewind time
Want you back in my room, like I do with a movie
Broke up my heart and my soul many times now
You could see right through me
And when I fell down, you were never around
Now you need me, oh, you need me now? Please

Want you back in my room, like I do with a movie

You could see right
I just heard that my other ex-girl is engaged to be married
I think commitment is scary
Maybe that's why it just didn't work out for us
When you show someone your soul, do you ever stop carin'?
Sometimes I wish I could just rewind time
Want to change anything, want to relive moments
Even if I know we wouldn't work out, that's fine
When the first door closes, another one opens
Told me I was hopeless
Now the same people hit me up, I never noticed
Every minute that you spent hatin' on me
Was another minute that I spent workin' on my own shit, had to stay focused
Never could've hoped it, never could've planned it
'Til you feel like you have nothing, you would never understand it
Complements are always backhanded
I see people lookin' for a handout, I could never fuckin' stand it
I just make anthems
And spill out my soul on these pages
Was meant for whenever was random
Used pain as a paint for this painting
I just miss what could've been, but I should just water my grass
And not worry about if the grass will be greener
Damn, it's also ironic
I wrote my first lines while I worked at the theatre, now I'm

Lately I've been reminded, they say time's of the essence
You pulled me deep from the trenches, I guess we're here for confessions
And lately, I been reminded that love is patient and blind
I can write a million lines and never find the words to define us
I know it's best not to rush
I know you're unsure if you're worth, I know how deep that can cut
He broke you down, so you don't feel much, there's forty thousand strings
Holding back our past precautions not often I let you in
It's not often you let me in, I get it, I mean why would you to
Take a chance on me? Then I get, I mean why should you?
'Cause me, I'm just a waiter with lucid dreams of the music
And you, you could find any guy, open mind in a student
I say it, in case we lose it, I hope that that never happens
I know our love runs deeper than just lust and attraction
I guess it's all the little things lately that make me think
I remember nights by the beach and us laughin' 'til we can't breathe
Or that CVS down the street, I don't know if you would agree
But I think...
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better
Old flames still burn like new
Sometimes they're hard to sever
And these walls don't lie, all they speak is truth
In this empty room, all I see is you
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better
Lately I've been reminded that love is all that is timeless
The pain you paint on your face, I see strength behind both your eyelids
And lately I've been reminded, I'm flawed, and nobody's perfect
The distance isn't easy, but nothin' is when it's worth it
I'm workin' to bring you all that I sense the weight that you carry
I wish you would let it all out and trust me, because I can't see
I wish you wouldn't compare me, he loved you without your clothes
But no, he's never seen you naked, never seen into your soul
And I love the way I see your mind, wonder when I get deep with you
I wonder why you cry when I tell you that I believe in you
I wish that I could take away the pain of how he treated you
My favorite nights were nights when it felt like it were just me and you
Damn, and if you ever cannot stand me
I hope that I made an impact and showed your heart what love can be
Envision us with a family, envision us where it's sandy
I feel you bringing me close, they in love with lovin' what can be
I know...
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better
Old flames still burn like new
Sometimes they're hard to sever
And these walls don't lie, all they speak is truth
In this empty room, all I see is you
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better
I think about the nights you cried as you reminisce on your parents
And the way you know that money can't buy love as a parent
You're self conscious of your ears, your head's always down when you wear it
And you I never drink when I'm soggy drunk it's apparent
I know, I just love watchin' you grow, you feel the weight on my soul
I always mess with a ten, I'm always hot when you're cold
And if they told us our love was just for a season
I want you to know I loved you, I gave my all and I mean it
I know...
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better
Old flames still burn like new

I hope you and him live happily

I don't know what's real, you lied through your teeth

Just like our pics, I'd press delete

About a hundred facts I found out were lies
I know you used me just to pass the time
But you could never say I didn't fucking try
What you meant to me is what I mean to art
Was real with you from the fuckin' start
You played games with my fuckin' heart
And after you, I fell a-fuckin'-part, damn
I know we weren't perfect
I guess I thought we were worth it
I guess your love was uncertain, you're busy at the club flirting
Friends just keep feeding you bourbon
Car smelling like his cologne and your weed
For months I would think, ""Is he better than me?""
I know that he can't love you better than me
I wonder, was it your intention to cheat?
Can't believe I believed you
Keep telling myself I don't need you
When talking to her, I just see you
Alone, but surrounded by people
Maybe one day you'll change and he'll reap the benefits

I ended up all alone
You ended up with a lame
Was addicted though to the pain
And the constant games that you play
Just being real when I say that still (It hurts to know)
It doesn't feel right with you gone (Gone, gone)
It hurts too much to be left alone ('Lone, 'lone)
I know I was never in your plans (Plans, plans)
But it doesn't feel right in her bed (Bed, bed)

Still, you're who my family adores
Maybe that's why it's hard to ignore you
After all of the time that we spent
Sad to think that I still didn't know you
Woke up in a city that we've never been to
I wish I could show you
Even my music, I put it below you
Just know I would had done anything for you (It hurts to know)
Remember I told you I felt inadequate
Because you came from a family with money
And me, I have nothing, I work as a waiter
With visions of turning myself into something
The music was buzzing but I couldn't pay for a bill
Off of people just saying they love it
Had class in the morning, had work in the evening
Then write through the night with no food in my stomach
Just know that it's hard
Damn, girl, it's so fucking hard
I keep telling myself that I need to move on
But it's hard to get close when you have up a guard
I know everything changed, the old me would prolly feel shame
For the bottles I've bought on my card
You would go to the bar while I was stuck working the double
To pay for the tank in my car (It hurts to know)
And I guess that it's best I pretend like I don't give a fuck
Even though, to be real, I'm a mess
I've been trying to find anything I can find
Just to fill in the hole in my chest
And it's sad to believe that a picture with me
Is a picture of you and an ex
You should know that it takes everything within me
To delete when I'm sending a text, like
It doesn't feel right with you gone

Refusin' it, I'm foolin' myself
Oh, Foolin' myself
Oh, so naive, oh, I couldn't see

Hey, Mark, I know you're mad but I thought that maybe you'd answer
So maybe last night was the last time that we'd speak
Remember who was there when your dad was goin' through cancer
Remember who was there when your soul was broken and weak
You see, I took my time with you, you just took me for granted
I juggled with my demons, you never would understand it
So when you said, ""forever,"" I thought about it and panicked
I lie, but when I told you I loved you, I meant it, dammit
I know I was never perfect, and you hatin' me for it
You say the same shit in your songs and have them praisin' you for it
And we were sittin', talk for hours 'bout your music and tourin'
And even though you say you loved me, I was less of important
I know, I hurt way more than I show, it hurts way more than you know
I know I cheated, but you cheated us both
Your trust issues tore a hole at me that you couldn't close
We were distant due to distance, what's different when you were close?
You're different, I hope you know, we argue now over nothin'
I'm goin' out with my friends, all you hear is someone I'm fuckin'
I know you're not gettin' trust, but cut me some fuckin' slack
I wish that night never happened, but sometimes it's still playin' back
I try to ignore the facts, I'm not the person you thought
Now all that's left are moments and every ticket we bought
That means all our heart, bitter, swallow, might wash it down with some shots
So cheers... to what we lost

To be honest, since you left, I barely eat or get ready
I been tryin' to fill this void with anyone who would let me
And I just hate how now we're stuck inside this game
The loser is the one who shows they care, feelin' pain
I'm checkin' if you took down all our pictures, just so I can do the same
Fuckin' petty, wasn't ready for you to just up and change
And I know that you'll only miss me when you fail to replace
Girl, I lived across the map, how could you need more space?
How could you be so fake? See, I was real from the start
Every lie was like a knife that entered straight to the heart
Don't know who you are, how could I when you lied from the start?
You feel empty, so you fill up every night at the bar
I feel empty, but can barely fill the tank in my car
They love you after 3 a.m., but they don't love who you are
I can't lie, honestly I still think about you
And when I go out with my friends, I still drink about you
I'm sorry if I made you question how I feel about you
Put you over everything, but now I have to live without ya, aw, shit
I'm drivin' into a tunnel so I might break up
I promise I would've stayed if there was a way I could save us
If only you spent as much time on us as you do your make up
I tried... and you gave up
Oh, so naive, oh, I couldn't see

Running from Here,Dreaming With Our Eyes Open,https://open.spotify.com/album/0x8V30SsjfBNY2PuQ9TO3w,2015,10065985,"Yeah, it's always mundane, always the same
All about the same girl and the same pain
Now I got two girls with the same name
Wait, I'm feeling myself
See, it's been a whole week, and I can't even tell
Right between going to heaven or going to hell
Feel like I'm stuck in a cell
Told me I'm selling my soul, are you selling yourself?
I feel like I'm walking on shells
What should I tell? Feel like Adele
Feel like my hands in the nail is the way that they want me
Stay quiet and keep to yourself
Maybe we're living in hell
Maybe it's all in our minds, or all a matter of time
You have no vision, you're blind
And lately I'm losing myself, now I'm harder to find
I feel like I'm stuck in a bind
Feel like I'm stuck in a Vine
Looping a day at a time
Wake up, you're working at nine
Why are we told never get out of line?
And why would I think you would ever be mine?
You never gave me a sign
And now you're the one that I'm leaving behind
Running from something that's bigger than I
I'm, so sick of nothing, wanna be something, Sausage McMuffin
Just to ease the pain this morning while my stomach's rumbling
Minimum wage, another day that I can't pay
Nothing's stuck in fucking gray
You eat gourmet, I microwave oven
Running, you're stuck on a leash
Wanna see Spain, and I wanna see Greece
Wanna see things I would never believe
I wanna wake up with a view of the sea
I wanna believe, I wanna achieve
I wanna perceive everything I could be
Perceiving is key, we are what we see
And lately I've been in this rut, now I wanna be free
I don't wanna hold back for you, put it all on my back for you, I
I don't know what's after you, who's after you, who knows?
Lose myself while chasing after you, I only ever got half of you, I
I don't know what's after you, who's after you?
Who knows, and who cares?
'Cause I'm run, run, I'm running from here
You're watching me run, run, I'm running from here
You're watching me run, run, I'm running from here
I'm running from here, I'm running from here
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
I guess what I wanna say is I feel stuck
I do like a girl with a big butt
I either don't drink or get too drunk
And pass out on my best friend's futon
I need to move on from this basic shit
I wake up, eat, and go and take a piss
You do something fun and have to take a pic
And really life is a movie, go and make a flick
You gotta make a pick, you gotta take a chance
Can't see the world when it's in your hands
And when I first started, it was Ty and Dan
Now it's still us, plus a couple fans
I've been stressing and I've been working hard
Hard is not enough when you regard a star
Been shooting far and only hitting Mars
There is more to life than just girls in bars
There is more to life than just getting by
I know you drink the pain, so you can chase the high
When they say you can't, you gotta question why
You will never understand my plan to drive, damn
Still stuck in this town, think of ""The Lights"" while I'm riding around
I focus on me, I don't care who you found
I'm coming for king, only thing is the crown
I'm tired of feeling so down
They say that I'll make it as soon as I'm found
But fuck being found, I stuck to my morals and ground
I care about my passion, my heart, and my sound
I care about the people here holding me down
My ex was a mess who was messing around
Ignoring your texts, you're irrelevant now
It's over, and now, I'ma run 'til I'm found
I don't wanna hold back for you, put it all on my back for you, I
I don't know what's after you, who's after you, who knows?
Lose myself while chasing after you, I only ever got half of you, I
I don't know what's after you, who's after you?
Who knows, and who cares?
'Cause I'm run, run, I'm running from here
You're watching me run, run, I'm running from here
You're watching me run, run, I'm running from here
I'm running from here, I'm running from here
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
No time to wait
Running from something, I'm tired of safe
I wanna be someone you never replace
I only see pain when I stare at my face and
Damn, open your eyes, open your heart
Open your mind, you're taking your time
You're taking too long, they're gonna forget you without a new song
It's, kinda funny how the game works
Talk about money, bitches, is paid dirt
And we all end up in the same hearse
So your legacy is really what makes worth, and
I don't wanna be stuck in this loop
Complacent and basic is how you will lose
We're standing for something, we're able to choose
And honestly, Mark, I've been running from, you
I don't wanna hold back for you, put it all on my back for you, I
I don't know what's after you, who's after you, who knows?
Lose myself while chasing after you, I only ever got half of you, I
I don't know what's after you, who's after you?
Who knows, and who cares?
'Cause I'm run, run, I'm running from here
You're watching me run, run, I'm running from here
You're watching me run, run, I'm running from here

Nah, I never signed a deal, always independent

Like, ""Bitch, do I look like a fair?""
Nah, always steppin' on me, it's sleepin' on me

Not prepared to feast, it's time to eat
How can I copy you when you're a lesser me?
You made a lot of noise, I made a masterpiece
Still laughin' at a few who laughed at me (Hehehe)
All the way to your desk
All I see is my worst when you offer your best
And you know I don't normally flex
But we came up from nothing, TEAMWITT 'til our deathbed, yes
Here is a fact
Could hold my whole nation with knives in my back
Some people still owe me a sorry in fact
Can keep all that shit, I don't live in the past
I'm livin' to rap, I'm rappin' to live
I can't tell the difference, you get what you give
You only hurt you if you never forgive
You already lost if you never begin
It's what it is, talk all your shit
Confused if you think I'm not one to go savage
You live in a basement and post your reactions
Of people who made it 'cause you were to average
If something's you teach how our rappin' is here
Please give your opinion, I'm dyin' to hear it
See, all of the things that you did in the year
That still never led to a music career
Oh, yikes, here, let me help
""Witt Lowry sucks, he should be shelfed""
Lately he's soundin' like everyone else
You copied the shit 'cause that shit wouldn't sell
If you'd change a word, or a lyric or two
And put it back out and pretend that it's new
Then maybe you'll grow in the way that he grew
I'm glad I aspired, but credit me too
Day in my shoes, you wouldn't last
Listen to ""Hurt,"" listen to ""Crash""
Try to do good, try to give back
And spill out my soul over all of my tracks
Craps in the barrel, they look down and laugh
And wring us for every last dollar we have
It's easy to make your lil' rappers look bad
When you don't own half of good tracks that you rap, damn
(Hehehe, huh)
Get it all by ourselves, fuck your advance
Fuck all the dollars they gave you for marketing
I just want music to come from the heart again
I just want music to become an art again
I was still workin' while you were out partyin'
Wonderin' how did I build up an audience
I put in work and just thought it was obvious
Give me a mic and a beat and I'll body it
(Du-du-du-du) I've been nice, but don't push me
I rap from the heart and you call me a pussy
I think you're a coward, you talk like you would be
I'm mad 'cause is my life is where you think you should be
Like, what do you get from it? Posting online
And just spreadin' some negative shit all the time
Yeah, your comment was mean, but I think I'll be fine
Hate the life that you live, so you're hatin' on mine (gah)

If you want to keep your integrity
You can't go on for mass production, can you?
I mean you can't just become a little cog in the big machine

I should probably call my mom, it's been a couple weeks
Funny how I live the dream but I don't fuckin' sleep
They bring nothing to the table and they want a seat
Constant battle in my mind and all I want is peace
I keep my trophies on the low so they don't feel bad
""Last Letter"" at my show, I know they feel that
I show the people perseverance when I feel sad
I put the music out for free and yet I feel trapped

Therapy sessions to deal with the stress
Guess the pain doesn't stop once you got a blue check
Think that I'd give a fuck 'bout the drama
When there's generational trauma
My fame doesn't want to address
People I've never met try to come for my neck
Guess I'm easy to hate
But I'm hard to offend
You see, we could spend all of our time searchin' alternate timelines
And still wouldn't find one where we'd become friends
Knew to call for the place where I stay in your head
Is it torture to know you will never consent?
I told Dan, ""Send me somethin' that's close to four minutes
'Cause I've got a lot to get off of my chest""
I need depth to connect, I need time to reflect
Listen, I've got some faults that I need to accept
Like the fact that I never check in on my sis
Even though it's as easy as sendin' a text
Guess I always forget, there's no cards ever sent
I lost track of what's truly important to gain
Used to pray to the Lord to remove all the fake
And then I looked around, there was nobody left
Well, guess I was blessed, Mom says I should rest
Girl says, ""Mark, the truth is you're not like the rest""
They told me, at best I would work at a desk
Lookin' back, damn, it's funny how people project
I've got vibes to protect, I've got lines to perfect
This is workin' on somethin' 'til nothin' is left
This is somewhere I went when my life was a mess
Time I take all these demons and put 'em to bed
Rip 'em out of my head, they say, ""Rip me apart""
I still think about when I wrote ""Into Your Arms""
See, I poured out my heart
Just for people a couple years later to say, ""We just like Ava's part""
They don't care about art, they don't care how it's made
Guess our biggest and best work aren't always the same
See, the difference between being indie and not
Is I keep my percentage and they get the fame
Look, I'll take that train, cards are close to the vest
See, they're all playin' checkers while I'm playing chess
And since when did we start to steal art from real artists
For follows on TikTok and likes on the Net?
The blatant disrespect is appallin' at best, yeah
You let an AI dictate all the thoughts in your head, yeah
The bulk of your follows are bought, so where are your friends? Yeah
I put in the work and then I let the work do the rest
♪
Yeah
Had someone tell me I'm a sinner 'cause I cuss in my raps
What about the ones who made fun when my dad passed?
If I tell 'em, ""Fuck off,"" I'm bound to fit God's wrath
'Cause some people in the past decided that that's bad
Their music is mediocre, the effort is half-ass
Their album is ten tracks, they didn't write half that
Their label sent over demos and told 'em to rap that
That makes them a cover artist, I'm sorry, but that's facts
They tell me, ""Retract that,"" you see me laughed at
When all that really matters is I get the last laugh
How's that feel to have your mom and your dad pay every bill that you have?
Maybe I'm mad 'cause I never had that
She's postin' her Cash App, she enters a cap card
She used to use Facetune, but just to edit her butt
Takin' pictures of her and all the girls at brunch
It's a front, she's been miserable the last few months
Enough's enough, I'm lyin', but I spill my guts
I can't even write a line 'less it packs a punch
Don't ask for much, instead I never have to rush
You saved money, but it's funny, need money to save us
I'm done with the fake love, they told me they need songs

If all we have left is tonight then I wanted to say
Say no more, but, tell me this (what)
Can you taste the pain in me, on my lips
Question when I saw your face was, who is this?
I was shooting for the stars and was shooting from the hip
Just know that I would never change you
Bless the woman that made you
Bless the people who came around when
You were down and out and then saved you
Fuck the people who played you
Your wall is up I don't blame you
I just want you to know your worth
And to love you the way that God made you
Made you and know
All I wanna do is be there for you through it all
Think about the nights when I would wait up for your call
My ex made me believe you can't trust anyone at all

When I had no money we would eat and you would pay
Sorry if you ever felt I ever made you chase
Why you wasting time always staring at your waist?
I just wanna trust you love you more now every day
We're at this diner that we found
Somewhere between then and now
And I ask if you want jam for your toast
You spent the night the other day
So many things I could say
Instead I just shy away and I choke
Uh, and I'm supposed to be a poet
So open with my emotions
And all I can ask about is your toast
I guess I'm glad you didn't leave

And telling stories a second time when you feel they're important
The love I have for you is rare I was just scared 'cause it's foreign
That had me thinking should I stop or shoot my shot like I'm Gordon
And still I flashback to the crash that could've ended we
The glass smashed somewhere past that's when you said to me
""You'll be alright"", thought if I'm not then I'll pretend to be
I'm thankful every day you found your way and then was lead to me
We're bloody and bruised
Assessing our wounds
Airbag in my face, you can't find your shoes
In shock and I'm sad, in pain and I'm mad
Look down at my stomach, all I'm seeing is black, uh
Lights from the back, they're blue and they're red
The guy who hit us never was found, just left us for dead
A million things I wish I could say, that never were said
I'm sorry if I'm here but not here, got lost in my head
A million things I wish I could do, to show you I care
Just know when you feel empty and scared, I'll always be there
Don't care about how much money you make or clothes that you wear
I care about memories that we make, and time that we share
Let's keep it real
It's hard for me to trust, they all went fake on me
I hope you keep it real and never change on me

I miss when AI didn't run the world
And people would consume less than they would create
I miss when gas didn't cost what I used to make
Back when I used to make minimum wage
If low serotonins are linked to depression
Are SSRIs just for numbin' the pain?
Kinda like how my dad used to get drunk off the liquor
To quiet the thoughts in his brain
Look, as you can probably tell
Lately my head and heart have been scattered all over the place
I miss when people saw me as a person
And not as the product of what I create
I wish that we were encouraged to critically think
But instead they just label you crazy
Now I know if I start gettin' too deep on a track
There's no way that the playlist'll play me, damn
If I made Witt, then the question is am I also the creator of Mark?
How many of you state your name and your job
When somebody asks you who you are?
We've all been conditioned to thinkin'
That life is as simple as fillin' in boxes
I used to prioritize people who only ever
Thought of me as an option, now
I'm somewhere in between bein' alone and bein' lonely
It doesn't really matter what they say if they don't know me
As people push and pull, you start to question who you are
Now everyone around you wants to sell you for your parts, yeah
Like an old Jeep, or a Nissan, a Chevy
I guess you'll really find out who your friends really are
When the subject starts gettin' too heavy
I miss when we would take photos to capture the moment
And not just to post them online
I don't know when we're duped into thinkin'
That money was ever worth more than our time
I don't like feelin' like if I'm not postin'
Then I'm just a ghost and I barely exist
We're all addicted to this little box in our pocket
Somethin' no one wants to admit
I think it's crazy I'm labeled as strong
If I say that I go to the gym every week
But if I replace the word ""gym"" here with ""therapy sessions,""
Then everyone labels me weak
Either way, I been workin' on me
I miss the simpler times
I miss when people were genuine friends
Not because of your clout but because you were kind
I miss when I wasn't used to get clicks and views
By people desperate for attention
I know they're chasin' that dopamine hit that they get
When they see that they have a few mentions, damn
I'm somewhere in between bein' alone and bein' lonely
It doesn't really matter what they say if they don't know me
As people push and pull, you start to question who you are
Now everyone around you wants to sell you for your parts, yeah
I'm somewhere in between bein' alone and bein' lonely

Influencers out here influencin' him
Don't realize that they're not influencin' shit
But to buy some more products to make them more rich, motherfuckers
Tom wants attention
Don't realize real life is worth more than his mentions
He's stressin', works nine-to-five just to pay for his pension
He questions his purpose, feels low, so he posts to suppress it
""Let the comments rain""
A bunch of people leavin' likes, but don't know his name
A bunch of people leavin' likes, but don't know his pain
The biggest battle that he fights is his own damn brain, fuck
His self-worth is tied to an app
Another day, another panic-attack
Another person on his pics remindin' him of everything that he lacks
He doesn't cry, so instead he just laughs and says
I feel the push and the pull

But lately she's been feelin', it's hard and harder to move
She struggles to do the things she used to love and I knew
But she's supposed to be a mom, shit
Her feelings feel like they been thrown into a moshpit
And everyone keeps congratulating
Her like she just won a fuckin' Grammy
Since her granny passed away, she's been an inch away from lost it
Went to bed nauseous, woke up feelin' nauseous
Can barely pay the bills or fill the fridge in her apartment
Went online for help, but all she found was people talk shit
Her baby has to grow up in a world so toxic, damn
Was havin' kids a mistake? Heh
No one admits it, even if they relate
She hits a feeling that she's better replaced
Been gettin' high and drinkin' wine just to get through a day
Just too much on a plate, doctors tell her just to take more pills
Tried one, she don't like how it feels
Knows that people have it worse,
But it doesn't make her pain less real
Tells her friends, time will hopefully heal, 'cause

He started makin' music just to show 'em he can spit
Make a little money, buy his mom and dad a whip
Proved to everyone who doubted now that he could make it big
Motherfucker's on the way, uses pain to paint the people his picture
The ones that want the most of, they never started off with ya
Somehow he has it gone off and lost himself into liquor
Or sold his soul for a playlist to
Play his shit, can you picture this?
Almost losing your sister, then you losing your dad
Then you losing your love or the love that you thought you had
Then you losing yourself writing ""Losing You,"" calling MAX
You're blessed and you fuckin' know

Your team is lazy and jumbled, my team is there if I stumble

It's funny how they think that they're relevant

You had your chance, girl why you cryin'?
Oh it's different because you love me now, why you lyin'?
Oh I get it, you're a mess cause the last guy you met hit and left
And that's when I get a text, you confess that you're all mine
All lyin', I've becomin' numb to it
When I said I had a dream, you put a gun to it
When you find me on your mind, I'ma run through it
When you want me back I will never give a fuck to it - I'm on a new level!
I got some new devils, I got some new demons
We're getting deeper than pussies
And sharks, only swarm when it's you bleedin'

And you and him ain't everything that you wish that he was
You hit Witt and then quit, so in the long run
You just fuck with my feelings for fun, say it!
You love me right now, well, then prove it to me!
""I promise I'm different,"" That's hard to believe
'Cause you talk, talk, talk, never walk, walk, walk
Guess a lame motherfucker is all you gon' be
Never want to be surface, I swim in the deep
Man, I swim in the deep
Hate on my music, hate on my concepts
Honestly, this is just me being me
So fuck your opinion, I stick to my vision
Makin' this music and all the decisions
I'm sorry, fake friends—I was always too driven
That caused a division, you hate but still listen, it's funny
Rappin' 'bout money makes money
Nowadays everybody wantin' something from me
You stealin' my style, gon' have to tear it from me
I would never dumb it, dumb it down for you dummies, ugh
Tried to make everybody happy
That was my biggest mistake
I could show you how I feel
Yo, get the fuck up out my face
I'ma blow, run the show
That's something I fuckin' know
I do this all on my own

I won't stop for nothing, I say
Yeah, I'ma do this on my own and now I'm
Sick and tired of running away

Wait until they kill that YouTube icon
Tried to make everyone happier, was I wrong?
People wanna see you fail when you've givin' your all
Waste days if you wordy, but talk's fake
Whole life in the copy-paste
Talkin' 'bout my mistakes, I guess you can't relate
To the path that I shoulda take
It piss you off that I tatted my face
But like I promised that it's real, I'm not fake
You see the hate's just a part of the fame
You see my purpose as a part of the change
You been stuck in your ways, I been riding the wave, yeah!
So many things I've been dyin' to say
What's it take to see what's goin' on in my brain?
I'm doin' well, so I can't complain; I took the pain
And made it art that y'all see it today
You don't like it? You can fuck yourself!
And give opinion to someone else
I made the best of the hand I was dealt
People that talk the most can't handle themself
So you hear about it's annual wealth
Your bad vibes gon' damage your health
Lost in your pride and never asked for help
Look into my eyes and see what they reveal
I'ma be a legend, I promise that for real, yeah

I'm spillin' my world, you're spillin' your hate
It's okay, you're a lame motherfucker won't ever relate
I'm a shark in the tank, you're the ship that I sank
I can't rap about money, there's none in my bank
And to think, you'd ever stop hatin'
Biggest mistake was to ever start datin'
That's time that I wasted, no time to be waitin'
I should be at Red Rocks and chillin' with Peyton

Not hard but go hard when your girl wanna get it
Get hard in the back, of a car do you get it
Don't need your opinion, my life I'ma live it
I told 'em we'd do it and all of us did it
My mind is defined, so my body in tune
I was built in the womb, but my mind on the moon
And I'm locked in my room like a fucking cocoon

I seem to find
All the answers to the questions I don't like
But you make them all alright
Yeah!
I often wonder what really it is that you offer me
At least I feel your touch, even if it's just when you walk on me
Your mind is always elsewhere, it's there, it's on, then it's off of me
I want to feel your depth, but your heart is deaf when you talk to me, uh
I guess that's what we were taught
We open up depending on how many drinks we have bought
He wants your head and it's ironic, doesn't care 'bout your thoughts
You're one more drink away from drowning, feeling empty and lost
But me, I'm no better, she wants to fuck around and I let her

I know you're looking for one night and I've been stuck on forevers
I think it's sad that I'm naive to think that we could do better, but fuck it
I should've known from the start
And even after all this time, I still don't know who you are
There's more to life than likes and hoppin' bars and gettin' high inside your car
You're feeling distant, feeling far, your wall is up, I know it's hard, and so
Tell me something only you know
Give me reason not to go
You have my heart
If I have yours, then let me know
And tell me something only you know
You have feelings you don't show

A viscous game that we play
See, nowadays, they say love and hate are one in the same
You let me beat around the bush, until you're sick of my games
It's never fair because you cared and I just transfer the blame
I transfer my pain, a shame to know that you could do better
How selfish, is it my concern as if I'm making you wetter
How selfish, is it you just want me 'cause I make you feel better
And we just chop it up to being drunk, that's wine on your sweater
Alone but together, we always make it less than it seems
It's funny how if you have feelings, you're weak, so we say less than we mean
You hate waiting, we're not dating and not vocal
We're game-playin', I hate sayin', but still hopeful
I'm conflicted, I'm lost in a lot of women
I know our situation's been sticky since the beginning
She left me out in limbo, you deal with my indecision
Don't know if you'll ever love me or love the talent I'm given, but fuck it
I should've known from the start
How can I feel so fucking lonely with your hands on my heart?
Your hands on my chest, you whisper, ""What do you want to do next?""
Our generation's taken love out of sex, and so the question is left
Tell me something only you know
Give me reason not to go
You have my heart
If I have yours, then let me know

See, since you left, it always feels like there's somethin' that's missin'
Does he care more about your passion or favorite position?
Or would you rather never ask him to ponder the difference?
Last time we talked, your mom was workin' hard at stayin' sober
Still hope that you and her are workin' on becomin' closer
Sometimes it's hard to just accept that you and I are over
I guess I wrote this more for me because I needed closure
I wonder if you ever wonder if I'm doin' fine
Or if you ever have those moments where I cross your mind
See, time itself, it doesn't heal, you heal yourself with time
I've just become another someone that you left behind, damn
Oh, I'm weak to my knees
I find it hard just to breathe
Knowin' you could just leave
You said you'd never let go, you'd never leave me
You'd never leave me, you'd never leave me weak (leave me weak, leave me weak)",https://open.spotify.com/track/3fB8qQjIDCahXOabDb59yc,239

I was trying to find feelings
'Cause lately I've been feeling numb
It's not fair to you
You deserve the one
Stop telling me I'm the perfect one
'Cause perfect is perception
Perception is all that they could see
Saw people turn fake like make believe
Never gonna find fake in me
No, don't ever give a fuck if they hate you
They'd probably hate themselves too
A couple girls wanna date you
A couple years ago, I was see through
You would never make it from the same shoes
Never gave me credit when I paid dues
Need a couple beats to put the pain to
A couple years ago, that was me too
That was back when I could barely pay rent
Saving water bottles just to make cents
Spilled my soul each and every night
On a couple beats with Dan Haynes and
Was waiting tables and a waitress told
me that my stupid dreams never made sense
Had a 9 to 5,
couple of people hating and they still sitting at the same desk
I know, I know
I got this shit,
Don't fuck with lames who wanna be me
Put my all into this shit

We were held together by 4 letters
Took a a couple L's
Ended up in hell
Thought the love was real
Should've known better
Had to bounce back
Invest all the money my account had
While rappers rap about a round ass
I'ma fuck the game and take the crown back
This is a sound fact
Here's a soundtrack for everyone who doubted,
And even me, I even thought about it
Your fake love, I could do without it
Every fucking stage, I hear the people shouting
I'm the people's champ
I'm the new rock
This is new rap, this is new pop
This is new rock
I fit no genre
The one and only,
The new mantra
Fuck commas,
Don't ever stop it
Still underrated,
Started from the bottom
Only see me fall,
If it was fucking autumn
Got a lot of followers
Who would pad your bottom
I'm a fucking problem
Should say it twice,
I'm a fucking problem

Talk to myself when I need great advice
Stars shine the brightest in the darkest nights

How are you gonna fuck with me now
Funny how everything changed
Now they in love with the sound
Don't give a fuck what they say
You should come see me on tour
Had a catastrophe
You cannot play me no more
Maybe I should get high
Yeah, something to balance the lows
Something to deal with the pain
Someone to call on my phone
I'm in love with the truth
Did this all on my own
Only real will remain

Hometown,If You Don't Like the Story Write Your Own,https://open.spotify.com/album/1rKIT2C7BONrvYegtGjeAp,2022,1186020,"Yeah, remember how the music sounded under streetlights on late night drives
And how the moon would illuminate the passenger side
It's twenty to five, I just passed Deepwood Drive
I wish I knew then I was livin' in my simpler times
Sometimes I'd walk around Nevers, headphones on in the rain
'Cause songs always sounded better than the thoughts in my brain
See, last year taught me how much in a year things change
When I'm in town now and look around, nothin's the same, damn
I don't know what they even mean when they're tellin' me I need to come home
Feels like yesterday I packed the car with everything that I own
Know myself less than I know those roads
But my hometown no longer feels like home
I'm back in town, just not for long
The only time that I come back is to visit my mom
I traded oak and maple trees for a couple palms
Remember back when I would rap songs at Tyler and Sean's
Their downstairs felt like Madison Square
There was prolly never more than three or four of us there
Nobody cared, but we never cared
I guess I always knew the thief of happiness is when you start to compare
Now I'm in town, and feel like a tourist
This is where my mom and dad had their first mortgage
This is where my dad passed, not to sound morbid
Lately learnin' that the little things are more important
Places I would visit daily now are so different
My old house no longer even looks lived in
I can't get back all the holidays I've been missing
You really don't know what you miss until you're at distance
Until you, ugh, now
I don't know what they even mean when they're tellin' me I need to come home
Feels like yesterday I packed the car with everything that I own
Know myself less than I know those roads
But my hometown no longer feels like home
Mom's talkin' 'bout movin' now out of state
Lookin' for a place that has a little more space
So I may not be comin' back, and that's somethin' I need to face
All the memories we made here are slowly startin' to fade
And my mom got remarried, she says she's changin' her name
And my sister got engaged, and she plans on doin' the same
I'll be the last one in my family with my family name
Now who the fuck is even family? Guess the question remains, 'cause
I don't know what they even mean when they're tellin' me I need to come home
Feels like yesterday I packed the car with everything that I own
Know myself less than I know those roads
But my hometown no longer feels like home
I don't know what they even mean when they're tellin' me I need to come home
Feels like yesterday I packed the car with everything that I own
Know myself less than I know those roads
But my hometown no longer feels like home
All these photos are moments frozen in time
They teleport me to a place I can only see in my mind
Remember summer nights, chasin' our whiskey down with some wine
And in the winter, how the air would combine with the smell of pine
Remember sittin' at the park all alone with a broken heart
In my car spendin' hours just starin' up at the stars
Back when validation came from a friend, and not from a chart

Graduated, got a job and you been working a grind
You're never looking behind
I know you never found me crossing your mind
But I'd be lying if you didn't cross mine
From time to time I see some of your pictures online
Kindest Regards was hard, I left my heart on the line
I wrote a song for you, took a couple months of my time
How can you praise him for flowers and a bottle of wine?
You'll never be mine, remember the time I came to see you?
I thought it would just be you, but there's twelve other people
You see there was never ""We"" so we could never be a sequel
Thought it might've been a date that day, did anything to see you
But I'm nothing more than nothing, you're bluffing, saying you care
Our only real connection is memories that we share
I would never try to blame you, 'cause blaming you isn't fair
Not that you care, the stress is really starting to wear
And in my music, I took our story and I used it
Don't care how you were feeling, I'm busy dropping my new shit
Know people gonna love it, I'm buzzing after I do it
I'm gifted with the curse of honesty and the truth is
I loved you more than words, I didn't know how to prove it
Can't tell you that in person, but always could through my music
Everyone who said they cared isn't there, now I'm confused
I'm broken and bruised, lonely, open, empty and stupid and still I
I thought I had it all figured out
No, you would never fall for me now
I wonder if you wonder why I'm never around
I wonder if you, I wonder if you wonder what I'm doing right now
You can hear the pain in my sound, laughed as I fell to the ground
I wonder if you wonder why I'm never around
I wonder if you, I wonder if you wonder what I'm doing right now
And I can't lie, it hurt a little when you said you didn't want me
To know I never tried is what continues to haunt me
Every pic I see is you and him, his twitter trying to taunt me
You think I let it go? This is old and exhausting
Some offspring, family in a house is what I thought about
Sometimes I wonder if he'll get that now
See we know that you picked a different path
Me, I picked a different route
And I can't help but laugh at how this all played out
You're over me now, I'm hoping you found only the best
Remember when we used to rep that Kanye West?
Graduation and rotation 'cause you liked that best
And back then I didn't want you, now look I'm a mess
I open my chest and through me you can see no spine
My profile pic and lyrics I've been hiding behind
It looks like you found the love that I was hoping to find
The only you I love is the one that I create in my mind and still I
I thought I had it all figured out
No, you would never fall for me now
I wonder if you wonder why I'm never around
I wonder if you, I wonder if you wonder what I'm doing right now
You can hear the pain in my sound, laughed as I fell to the ground
I wonder if you wonder why I'm never around
I wonder if you, I wonder if you wonder what I'm doing right now
I thought I had it all figured out
No, you would never fall for me now
I wonder if you wonder why I'm never around
I wonder if you, I wonder if you wonder what I'm doing right now
You can hear the pain in my sound, laughed as I fell to the ground
I wonder if you wonder why I'm never around
I wonder if you, I wonder if you wonder what I'm doing right now
I often wonder if you ever did care
I wonder why in my mind is the only time you ever were there
See we were friends, but that felt more like pretend
This year is awfully clear, the real us is what I fear
The one where we were only friends and I acted like we dated
And nowadays our conversation is, ""Hey happy belated""
And every song I wrote for you, you know you actually hate it
Because you realize that you never felt the same when you played it
You never cared if I made it, that's why I waited, you know me
See, all the love that I've been getting through my phone feels phony
I rhyme a couple words together, every girl wanna blow me
We're in a world full of people, yet I'm feeling so lonely
If only I could tell myself there's plenty fish in the sea
But see the sea is full of sharks, fake guppies and greed
And as I find myself drowning while I'm fighting to breathe
I realise that I'm in love with what I thought we could

Mom always want a divorce
Dad calling mama a whore
Drunk, been drinking all weekend
A couple of coors
A couple of doors are broken
Covered the floor, damn
So he's told never to tell
If anybody finds out
He'll be put in a cell
Hit with a belt
There will be nobody to help
And so he prays every day
While he's stuck in this hell
All to himself
He holds every ounce of it in
All the kids who have things
Always laughing at him
All the teacher sees is pain
But he's playing pretend
Playing with friends is something
He wishes he can
But, nobody wants to give him a chance
Nobody wants to be with a man
Been looking in the future
But the future is so far in advance
Looking at the alcohol in his hand
Like damn, like why
Why god
Why do I do this again
And, why am I getting so drunk
See my dad was a drunk
I don't wanna be him
I, I know im searching for feelings
I thought I could find them in bottles of gin
I'm tired of losing my faith
And then looking to fake to replace all my feelings within I
I don't wanna lose myself, lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
Just to ruin, a silicone kingdom with you, with you
I don't wanna lose myself, lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
Just to ruin, a silicone kingdom with you, with you
She goes to read another message
Hoe, slut, stupid, and fake
She doesnt know how much she can take
She lookin at her body
Its her body that's she plans to replace
Fake, everything all over her face
It's fake, smile, leads up to her lashes
Never been askes about passion
Only been asked about passin the blunt to the left
Or a pick of a chest called him bitch and a mess
She's a wreck
Waitin for a text from a guy
He'd tell her that he love her but he wanna see her cry
He'd tell her that he love her but he beat her every night, with a pipe
That despite she might leave him for a guy with a tie and a job
A mike or a rob
She tired and sobs on the knob of a door
Yelling out ""Please I can't take no more""
And he's yelling out ""Fuck you, you cunt you whore""
Damn, she doesnt wanna be on the news
Only twenty two looking down the barrel of a 22
Looking for a move she can make
Looking at the bruise on her face
Never felt safe
Never felt late 'till the end of the month
Looking down at her stomach
Like what have we done
I was looking for love
And you were looking for fun
And now a life is in my body cause you wanted to cum
Like why, why god
Why do I do this again
And, why am I thinking that we can can find love inside lust
And we love to pretend
I, I know I'm searching for feelings
I thought I could find them by fucking with him
I'm tired of losing my faith
And then looking to fake to replace all my feelings within I
I don't wanna lose myself, lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
Just to ruin, a silicone kingdom with you, with you
I don't wanna lose myself, lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
Just to ruin, a silicone kingdom with you, with you
He's addicted to the worlds most dangerous drug
Don't wanna make you lose everything that you love
And we don't understand
Money doesn't buy love
So we pile up all our money just to buy
Some new cars, some new rims, a new binz
He doesn't have friends no more
An Ipod, an Ipad, an Imac
So rich that he's feeling poor
If he had one chance to go back
Wishes that he never bagged a whore
A couple more coors and a broken door
Shatter the coor all over the floor
Coming home at a quarter to four
Coming home is a bore
Looking at a gin bottle
Got a quarter to pour
At a local titty bar
I got a better a pour
No cover ones cover the floor
Really looking for more
And more money makes more problems
He don't understand how to solve them
Doesn't understand his son and his wife or his life
Every night when they fight
Now he's looking at 'em as a problem
That's a problem
Now he doesn't know what to do
Out of touch leaving ten every weekend or two
Thinking money maybe buys all the happiness too
'Till hes sitting in a room staring back at a 22
Like, what happened to life
It was so many years and I thought I was right
It was so many years never living my life
And im scared that my son turnes just like, me
Why me, my god
Everything I see really is a facáde
Fake love, fake hair, fake bills, fake, bi
We replace as a race and we try to play god
Like why, why god
Why do I do this again
And why am I getting so drunk
See my dad was a drunk I don't wanna be him
I, I know I'm searching for feelings
I thought I could find them in bottles of gin
I, I know we're thinkin' that we can find love inside lust and we love to pretend

If you planned on leavin', you should've burned me down
I was whole, but I've been fallin' to pieces
Wondering why you had to leave me (Yeah)
Been lookin' for peace in the pieces you left me in
You lied when you said you would love me forever
Then ruin what you and I had
Would never go back to you and I being just friends again
I don't know what else you wanted
I gave you my all 'til my all got exhausted
I lay herе alone in this bed, and I look at this room
And can't help but to feel likе it's haunted by you
What do I do?
When everything in here reminds me of you
Everything smells like your favorite perfume
And the truth is you've never been good with the truth
Isn't that true? I miss what we had
Now you're just someone I knew in the past
I see myself in the way that you act
I hear myself in the way that you laugh
You can't deny that, ""I made a mistake""
That's what you said when you called me that day
You're hanging with people I know that you hate
And even your friends have been sayin' you changed
Bumped into your sister, she said you been lost
Been fillin' the void with a couple of shots
Forgive what you did but it can't be forgot
We even talked about tyin' a knot and now
We both act like we don't exist
But deep down we know, it shouldn't end like this
And time will pass while we both resist
But deep down we know, it shouldn't end like, end like this
Deep down we know, it shouldn't end like this
And time will pass while we both resist
But deep down we know, it shouldn't end like (Yeah), end like this
You're not the first person to make me feel like I was homeless
See, you were the hardest to leave
You said that lovin' me felt like a chore
But I know that there's somebody prayin' we'd meet
Of course you don't see all the blessings in front of your face
When your eyes are always on your feed
I hate to think you and I fell apart
So instead, I reframe it as ""mission complete""
Go find what you need, couldn't find it in me
Maybe I should say ""thank you"" for settin' me free
Now there's this gap on your page where our pictures would be
Before you felt the need to delete every moment
I see, you just want me erased
I'm not just someone you were with for a day
Nah, I was someone that went to the ends of the Earth
Just to make sure that you were okay
Now nothin's the same, the same as it was
You shook my faith about fallin' in love
It sucks to know that on the list of the things in your life
There was nothin' you put me above
Damn, not even one, so this is goodbye
Hope you find the love you were hopin' to find
Think maybe the only real version of you that I knew
Is the one I made up in my mind, now
We both act like we don't exist
But deep down we know, it shouldn't end like this
And time will pass while we both resist
Deep down we know, it shouldn't end like (End like)

Last Letter,Last Letter,https://open.spotify.com/album/1BpKgHKJFd1qx6wpYjHs9M,2017,24516345,"I miss, I mi—, I miss you
Eh, fuck it!
This might be the hardest song I've ever had to write
Yeah, I dreamt about you last night
I only see you when I close my eyes tight
Yeah, I wish I told you how I felt before you left
But it just never felt right
Yeah,
♪
I wish I told you everything before you left
I won't forget the day that they found the growth in your chest
The cancer took ahold of your body and then it spread
I talk to you more now than I ever did—I'm a mess
This song will never capture the pain that I could express
I learned from you that nothing is perfect, but try your best
I know you had your demons that younger me didn't get
And out of all our demons, our biggest might be regret
Relate more than ever, remember back when I would only see you every other week
And every other Wednesday, you would take us out to eat
Mom and you had split, so we're living in between
Looking up the word ""divorced"" to understand what it could mean
But I don't understand, Mom is with another man
You been drinking heavier than me, wish just another can
Culture full of broken homes, we were just another fam
Coulda left like other dads, you, you had another plan
So you stuck around, dealt a life that you probably would never choose
You bottled it inside and that bottle turned into booze
The Jäger took ahold and your body took the abuse
But finally found some pride and cried when I got the news
I know, been hurting more than I show
Inspired by your story, couple things you should know
I met this girl at my show, teared up by what I was told
She said, ""I'm sober 'cause of you, you do way more than you know""
And I say
And I say, ""Ohh, please grant me the serenity
To accept everything I cannot change""
You, you always told me I had to do anything
To have you back, see you one day
I, I wonder if you see me when I fall, yeah
I wonder if you hear me now at all
Maybe if the world played this through speakers
I'd be loud enough to reach you, and you'll hear
My last letter for you
And I don't understand how you would stay so optimistic
You started chemo, fought the battle, never quit
That really left an imprint
And we would talk about our lives and after this
How we would live 'em different
See, Mom and you would put your differences aside
Every day she would visit, see the love and your vision
See the hurt in your smile, your wisdom is what I'm missing the most
I'll never be ready to let you go
I never felt so helpless inside a boat I control
You told me how you wanted to travel, next year you'll go
And your body had become fragile, not once that you lose your soul
We were told, it was progressing and you had less than a week
True love is every tear when we told you we had to leave
And how we would converse it, not once did we need to speak
That one day in late October you passed away in your sleep
I been cryin' when I think about it
I miss your smile, miss your laugh, and now I live without it
I told you music was my passion, and you never doubt it
And people tell me they relate, but now I truly doubt it
Remember cryin' on your grave and yellin' up to you, ""How did I lose my way?""
I won't forget that summer was some of my darkest days
Was asking for a sign, sat in my tears and prayed
When I saw that sign you sent me, that day was forever changed
I know, I know, I should've been a better me
Oh, blame me when we argue, I said things I didn't mean
Me and you are who I wish, you should have always been between
So I'm sorry for the lack of communication from me
I just wish that you were here, so you could watch me win a Grammy
But more importantly to build a family
I hope I make you proud and become everything I can be
I hope they play it loud and send this letter where I can't reach
Sincerely, Mark
And I said, ""Ohh, please grant me the serenity
To accept everything I cannot change""
You, you always told me I had to do anything
To have you back, see you one day
I, I wonder if you see me when I fall, yeah
I wonder if you hear me now at all

I knew for my dream, I do whatever it takes
Now here I stand, no one in my way
And now I'm surrounded by all that people say
Yeah, they told me time is of the essence
I ain't sweating, I'm blessed, blessing the tenants
While everybody changing, I never stray from my message
As I sit inside my room, it's a tomb to every invention
And every line that I never gave the time or attention
I'm learning my lesson, you looking for a mention, it's funny
What you would do for the approval of a room full of dummies
You think I made it? But I'm stuck here serving burgers for money
It's funny how I'm selling beef and you don't want beef from me
My written turned into a vision, my vision a reality
My chips are on my dream and you seem to try to devalue me
Value me as less, I got no desk or a salary
You value me by likes on my pictures, not personality
Living my own reality, manifested my vision
Looking at the sky, thanked God for what I was given
Based on how I'm living, I'm wondering if I'll get it
Your passion'll set you free and your fear is more like a prison
We're driven, living life, hope I'm doing it right
Went through hell with a knife, killed every demon in sight
I went through darkness of night to find the brightest of light
You only dreaming at night, I turn my dream into life
We're letting go of who left, you never thought it was right
So many nights I pray for the day
I knew for my dream, I do whatever it takes

I graduated, got a job and still I chose just to write like this
You see the people need advice like this
Building something out of nothing
I ain't bluffing with a sight like this
I know I'm nice when I write, you're like ""I don't get.""
It takes intelligence to listen, something I can't give
I flip the prespective, you see what I just did? Do you get it?
Now take a minute, no it takes you a minute to keep it real
I'm still broke, but got beautiful women
Who see me as an opportunity
Not human, was given an opportunity from no one ever
Who am I kidding?
Fought for my vision, built a team who all believe in my passion
I'm on my way out to LA, I wonder ""How did this happen?""
I turned my dream into a team who all believe in my rap and
You went from laughing to a picture when my lyrics are captioned
And honestly I want this more than ever breathing
The people that need a voice, I'm the voice of people believing
My family all believing it's all in me to achieve it
Don't do it because we want it, we want it because we need it
So many nights I pray for the day
I knew for my dream, I do whatever it takes
Now here I stand, no one in my way
And now I'm surrounded by all that people say

Can make myself comfy, I'm better off all alone
And what's with all the wind? Since I've got here it's been blowin'
But fuck it, this'll do, and between me and you
I never planned on leavin' to tell you the damn truth
It's all a part of life, some things you just can't chose
You've never know I exist 'til you're sick and you can't move
It's either me or it's you, it's either you or it's me
I never could be the one you really want me to be
So different, but we're the same, I eat when you can't eat
I sleep when you can't sleep, I breathe when you can't breathe
Take a second, let it resonate
I'm in everything you do, each and every day
I'm in everything you do, you were never safe

Waste your life away, every day you sit at a cubicle
I've been movin' into some other spots that are suitable
Haha, I hear you clickin' those keys
I hear you talkin' to your doc, got an appointment at three
He's gonna tell you you have cancer—what he means is me
They perceive to tell you things that might make me leave
Geez, slow down! Why are you drivin' so fast?
Oh shit, it's a quarter past, go quick, foot on the gas
Get your ass up in that office, do everything that they ask
They question if you been smokin', don't lie, we know that you have
Deep breath, but you can't breathe
He wants to see in your chest, what's that? Time to say ""Cheese!""
He can't believe what he sees, you can't believe what you see
I feel you're startin' to sweat, I feel the shake in your knees
Damn, I'm sorry that it's too late
He tells you ""Chemo might help,"" but you won't be saved
The next trip we take, it only goes one way
You wasted half your life just so you get paid
And all the money that you made, shit, you can't take
So you leave it in your bank for your grandkid's sake
Been feelin' all of your pain, I feel the way that you ache

But you'll never run from me
Mmm, but you'll never run from me
A couple months and now we lie in this bed
The chemo didn't work and now I've moved to your head
I see all of your thoughts, you think about being dead
You think about all the things you often wished you had said
Like a couple more ""I love you,"" a couple more ""I trust you""
A couple more nights prayin' to the one above you
You are never gonna be a single person but you
You spent your whole life in the mirror sayin' ""Fuck you!""
Where you gonna run to? I hear the room cryin'
I wish that I could say, ""You'll be okay,"" but I'd be lyin'
Could buy anything, but could never buy time
And it's sad that you only realize when you're dyin', shit
I can feel your lungs weaken
Who knew your last weekend would become your last weekend?
Family's in the room, I wonder what they been thinkin'
I feel your heart, it's so heavy, I feel your temperature's sinkin'
It's time, no one can keep you alive
The human kind make environment's perfect for me to thrive
I guess we both destroy the one thing that keeps us alive
So buckle up, motherfucker, it's time that we take a ride, so

A true DIY pioneer here, what the fuck do you mean?
So you sign a deal, now you just puppet to be
So you stealing ideas? So you stealing from me
I put my time into my music, not a song every week
The deeper the trench, the higher the peak
I got to document my lines before you rappers comin' stealin' from me, haha
And they say people lie, numbers don't
Put myself as a wallpaper on my own phone
To remember who was there when I'm looking for a loan
Well, I'm lookin' for some help, now nobody gotta phone, huh?
You were lyin' when you said you weren't lyin'
Every lie's another step to the fact I'm goodbyin'
Dodge a bullet when you left, yes, I'm off a good time
And I hear every single truth in your silence, yeah

I would rather have that than feel good about a lie
All I wanted is for us to have trust, but you gave it all up
'Cause you couldn't stop lyin'
You were lyin' when you said I wouldn't make it, you were way off
I would be fucking lyin' if I said I took a day off
They talk about the money that they have 'til they pay off
I got a couple loans and bills to pay off, damn
Well, I was on you Instagram last night
Saw 100k followers, only had 11 likes
Guess the numbers do lie when you pay the right price
Couple pictures of your ass like, ""My hair looks nice, huh?""
You're online and hopin' people wanna be you
Without your hair and makeup, won't let anybody see you
What's funny is the fact that you don't even wanna be you

So sad, I need a friend
Thought ya'll could sedate
Your mistake was putting a needle in
Ya'll broke skin
Now all the demons, they keep on creepin' in
Your mouth is full of shit
I might hit the lip when I piss in it
I took a pic and post it on my Twitter like
What's happenin'?
I hope that I can get a couple likes and find a badder bitch
With nice tits
A nice ass
Some nice lips
A nice rack
She said, ""You're coming too quick""
I said bitch, you define fast
I look up at the clock, how much time pass?
One minute
Oh yeah, you know a minute was straight drillin' that fine ass
She said, ""I think you're lyin', I'm tired and where's the wine at?
And where is all the weed? I'm in need of something to climax""
I said okay, uh, well let me see what I got
I start to search around my house, I found my ex-girl's top
I went from soft to jacking off, now I'm in need of a mop
Then I hear her yellin' from my room, ""Mark, I said I want pot""
Destined to flop
'Cause look at all the bullshit on top
My only chance at success is if Kanye tells me to stop
While I'm at the Grammy's and they hand me the award for best pop
And I think I'm joining One Direction now that Malik is lost
Need a moment to pause
I wanna say hi Miss Swift
If you ever gave me the chance then I could show you my dick
I could send you a pic
I don't care if Harry doesn't like Witt
Like B and J, Witt and Tay, we could take over this shit
Uhh
We could take over this shit
Me and you, we could take over this shit
Hahahaha
But for real, though
Yo
So why'd you send your daughter to college here in the first place?
You pay 20k and your daughter became a sperm bank
Was fuckin' five guys on the first day
She learned how to suck a dick
And still hasn't experienced her first A, damn
She's lookin' up from her knees
She knows about whiskey neat, double D's and the trees
She's gettin' high because the last guy, he left her with ease
Asking him, ""Please don't leave, you said you loved me""
On Tinder swiping right like which bitch gon' fuck me?
You know that I'm the man, five grams of protein and some money
And girls are saying they love me
And guys are wishing they was me
I'm offering nothing more than a washboard on my tummy
It's funny
I might go name my next album The Carter VII
And sell a bunch of copies outside of 7 Eleven
And make it sound like shit so that no one can comprehend it
Baby, must have fucked your ears
And then career
'Cause you ain't sellin'
I'm not dissin' who you think I'm dissin'
It's someone different
I try to be nice and no then one listens
So I'm pissed
And if I hear another bitch try to tell me how she is different
Like, ""I never get around""
But her pussy, I fit my fist in
Insisting that I'm so jealous
I'm jealous of who?
Your screws are loose for you to think I'm jealous of you
You're lame and never made anything but balls turn blue
Tellin' the truth
And when offended, then I'm talkin' 'bout you
And I'm talkin' 'bout you
Stupid ass bitch
Hahaha
Fuck you, you, you and you
Oh
I must be over privileged 'cause I comb my hair
While I'm looking through Wal-Mart
Target and Kohls for some clothes to wear
You stupid fuck, I got a hairy pair
Just for you to suck
And if I bust, I might just bust in your hair
Because I aim high
We are not the same guy
You are just a lame with no brain and a day job
My dad, he got laid off
Too drunk off the Jager
And still drove me all around the town
Wow, thanks, pa!
You could have fucking killed me
I could have been dead
Your only purpose on this Earth was your sperm
And now look what you did
You created the greatest rapper to live
And when I'm standing at the Grammy's
Hi, Granny!
Bitch, you ain't worth shit
Look at me win
I had a friend and he's irrelevant now
Come to find out
Found his tongue in my ex-girl's mouth
Karma's a bitch
And the last I heard is you was surfing the couch
The day you go out is a day that I feel bad for the ground
You're stealing my sound
You're wack and I don't wanna collab
Look at your past
I'm counting every rapper line that you jacked
You sound like me if I could suck on my sack
Like, ""Witt, drop shit so I can copy it and say I can rap""
I've come to attack
You bottom feeder fucks, I'ma blast
Stealing your art and then your lyrics
You're not real, you're an app
Not tweetin' you back
You're honestly the parrot of rap
You're making me laugh
I'm everything the rap game lacks
In fact
Go ahead, compare to the greatest again
They said that Em sounds like Nas
And Hop sounds like Em
And I sound like Hop
So where do we end?
Stop comparing me
Comparing what you can't comprehend
Can't wrap your head around the fact that I'm just nice with a pen
I'm standing up and talking shit, I'm never one to pretend
Never one that would blend
I'm not Eminem and I'm not Lennon

The War I'm Scared to Face,If You Don't Like the Story Write Your Own,https://open.spotify.com/album/1rKIT2C7BONrvYegtGjeAp,2022,5667676,"Even if you don't, I still remember it all
You were my shelter from the rain when it'd fall
I would call, but never came
I'm not perfect, but I swear I've changed
I still hear your voice, it ricochets off these walls
Give me the words and I'll explain why I faltered from grace
And for all I hold for blame
Just give me one more chance, I'll fight the war I'm scared to face
First things first, I know this letter might be long overdue
Just wanna tell you it's been hard for me to tackle the truth
And watchin' you become a shell of who I knew in my youth
You were the glue that kept the family from splittin' in two
Hate what you have to go through, I bet you feel so alone
You were my shelter back when everything was messy at home
When no one else was there, I knew you'd always answer your phone
Now when they ask you who I am, it hurts, you might not know, damn
Guess I'll remember for us both
Remember when we saw those whales and you threw up on the boat
Remember spendin' days at Fenway, those are days I miss the most
Remember how you cracked a smile when I told you that I wrote
And then you told me you believed in me and my dream-chasing
That's back when I'd record on a USB in the basement
And now I'm here helpless and honestly fuckin' hate it
I know you hate when I swear, but I don't know how else to say it
I remember all the stories you told me 'bout meeting Gram
I know you still remember her laugh, the touch of her hands
They try to say you can't, don't think anyone understands
She's a part of who you are like you're a part of who I am
And damn, when Dad and Gram look down
I wonder if it makes 'em sad where the fam's at now
And when I stand up on stage, where the music is loud
And look out, I swear I see their faces out in the crowd
What hurts the most is that you're here, but haven't seen you in years
But not because of lack of tryin', I want that to be clear
The situation's way more complicated than it appears
And when I think about it all, it always brings me to tears
I fear, as your memory fades
And the dementia makes its way through every inch of your brain
You'll forget about me and all the memories made
I'm not okay, I guess what I'm tryin' to say is
Even if you don't, I still remember it all
You were my shelter from the rain when it'd fall
I would call, but never came
I'm not perfect, but I swear I've changed
I still hear your voice, it ricochets off these walls
Give me the words and I'll explain why I faltered from grace
And for all I hold for blame
Just give me one more chance, I'll fight the war I'm scared to face
Just know it kills me to feel like I let you down
When all I really ever wanted was to make you proud
I miss all of the stories and the wisdom that would spill out of your mouth
Now when we have a conversation, you can barely make a sound
Everything's so different now, I have this hole in my heart
When you moved and Dad passed, the whole fam fell apart
Not havin' either of you here has been so terribly hard
The truth is y'all were the light when my thoughts got dark
I heard you had a birthday and I missed it
I look around the room and not a single relative's here on Christmas
Sometimes I feel the distance has led to us actin' distant
Nothin' is the same, things changed in an instant
And nah, I should prolly call
Always say ""I will,"" but I always drop the ball
Damn, you see the truth is I'm a coward tryna stall the inevitable
Fact, one day I'll call and there'll be nothin' you recall
And I'm appalled that this is how this all played out
A beautiful mind that we just have to watch fade out
See, you're the one who taught me how to make a home out of a house
And that happiness is found when you live in the right now
Not the future or past, just want my grandfather back
Woulda hung on to the moments if I knew they wouldn't last
Just know I'm grateful now for every single second we had
It's sad you'll never see a show or ever get to see me rap
And that's that, fuck, sick of feelin' stuck
Sick of feelin' like everybody has givin' up
Sick of always feelin' like I'll never be enough
'Cause I tried to wear your shoes, but I could never fill 'em up
I'll never know a world where I'm able to let you go
Even though I know to let go of the things that I can't control
It's sad you'll never see me with a family of my own
But know that when that day comes, you'll be a hero in our home, so
Even if you don't, I still remember it all
You were my shelter from the rain when it'd fall
I would call, but never came
I'm not perfect, but I swear I've changed
I still hear your voice, it ricochets off these walls
Give me the words and I'll explain why I faltered from grace
And for all I hold for blame

I can see you're all over my wishlist, I can see it all now
Now let's keep it honest, who'd you copy after?
Erase your socials, I own my masters
I'm a trendsetter to you trendy rappers
I would mumble too, if I was rappin' backwards
I would mumble too, if I was just a puppet
Talkin' 'bout my dick and how these bitches love it
Never had a filter, never one to fuck with
Told me turn my sound, now it's buzzing
I was taking back, told 'em, ""Fuck that!""
They're in love with money, they don't love rap
Tried to show love, get no love back
Never play me, that's a fun fact
And your album sounded like one track
I don't see a ceiling, I'm above that
Wanna see me fall, they would love that
Is anybody else bringin' love back, uh
No, I'm the only one
I know, I know I'm the only one
We have a lot to cheer, so they pour me one
Only one can judge, that's the holy one, yeah!
I can see blood in the water, I don't want none of you fishin'
I can sing anything honest, I don't want none of your business
Fuck with my vision, I can see 'em all over my hit-list
I can see you're all over my wishlist, I can see it all now

Fuck with my vision, I can see 'em all over my hit-list
I can see you're all over my wishlist, I can see it all now
Opinions from people that never get it
You buy every lie that they're sellin' to you
You stole my style, never gave me credit
You would buy my story, if I'd sell it to you
Remember back, I was surfing couches
My new estate got a fuckin' fountain
A middle finger for a fucking doubt
Keep it deep enough to watch ya fuckin' drownin' now
I can see blood in the water, I don't want none of you fishin'

Yeah
You were right, said I'd change and never do
Between you and I, think it hurts because it's true
I can't tell you why I put all the blame on you
Then say, ""You decide,"" what the fuck we're supposed to do?
Hate to see you cry and hate more that I'm to blame
When I realize I'm the one that cause you pain
This is real life and you're tired of the games
And you feel like I may never fucking change
When the highs get high and the lows get low
All I know is you're the one I love
As the tide gets higher and the world's on fire
You're the only one I'm thinking of
Put up wall after wall, was terrified to fall
Instead of leaving, you took time to break through
You have friends that are fam, and fam you can't stand
Guess in blood and in love, we don't choose
You say, ""You should try, not just try to win me back""
You disguise all your pain behind your laugh
Been losing sight of the future and the past
Now, who am I? Lately, I've been losing track of who
I wish I could make you love me
I guess so I could feel you hold me
I'm tired, empty, stressed and lonely
Lost on nights like this
The only one I want around me
Can't bear to see your life without me
I'm sorry for the times you found me
Lost on nights like this
Just because we have a heart
Doesn't mean we have a heart
Just because we make mistakes
Doesn't mean that's who we are
Said some shit tonight that I regret
I wanna learn how I can love you best
And just because I hide it well
Doesn't mean it didn't scar
Only time I feel at peace
Is when I lie in your arms
I have angels that I wish you met
And some demons I should keep in check, damn
Can't expect you to save me
I've been lost, haven't talked to my family lately
You know that that ain't me
Just know I love you, have love for the woman that made me
We're under the same stars
And I'm scared you won't love me the same when the day starts
Hate that I play a part
To the hurt in your heart, hear the hurt when you say, ""Mark""
You should try, not just try to win me back""
You disguise all your pain behind your laugh
Been losin' sight of the future and the past
Now who am I? Lately, I've been losin' track of who
I wish I could make you love me
Again so I could feel you hold me

I make art, you make memes, bitch, we are not the same
We are not the same, I'm just sayin'
I got my foot on they neck
'Til every one of them pay me respect
Buyin' designer and diamonds to flex
I called up my mom and I paid off her debt
Didn't do that just for likes on the 'net
Remember when we couldn't pay for the rent?
Not bad for some guy who complains 'bout his ex
Turned on all my old shit, to hear all the new shit
You're gonna do next, haha
1A0 wit
I diss my own blood, so don't think I won't diss
They told me God gave me a gift
Now how many writers you got? I been makin' a list
You shoot from the hip, I shoot for the sky
I'm shootin' for being the greatest alive
Dan said they aren't ready for POM5
Been workin' all night, I can sleep when I die
I'd rather cut my ties before I waste my time
You don't think about the boy, then why you hittin' my line?
Stick around long enough and watch the lames switch sides
Just hit my stride, yeah, I'm on my rise
I tried to please them all, instead I lost my mind
You wanna see me fall? Well bitch, get in line
Doesn't mean you found gold, just because that shit shine
Just hit my stride, yeah, I'm on my rise
This year red is all I see
Just me, myself and my team
You can rap over Witt type beats
But you can never be me
Three rappers in your top three
They don't profit off all those streams
'Cause some old guy up in an office owns the MP-3
We need less sheep, we need more thought
Stuck stayin' ""indie,"" 'cause I can't be bought
One on the charts when you said that I flopped
I look at my plaque and I smile a lot
The bottom is lonely and so is the top
Find you a girl with a plan, not a plot
A fake will jump ship, then they'll say I fell off
Then crawl back when they're feelin' empty and lost
I'm thankful for every fan that I got
They got you a playlist to sweeten the pot
You spend your advance on a chain and a watch
I spend my own money on shit that I got, hehe
I keep it real, feel like the only one
The game's been off balance, all you rappers are Napoleon
I'd rather cut my ties before I waste my time
You don't think about the boy, then why you hittin' my line?
Stick around long enough and watch the lames switch sides

You wanna see me fall? Well bitch, get in line
Doesn't mean you found gold, just because that shit shine
Just hit my stride, yeah, I'm on my rise
You sing that shit like you wrote it
You sing that shit like you own it
You even know you won't last
You're only here for the moment
Just know the chamber is loaded
Give me a time and a motive
I've got some friends in high places
You know, your label, they own it
I treat my room like a cocoon, I should get out more
They wanted honest music, but instead they fuckin' found yours
It's sad you're only known for stupid shit that you get clout for
Never needed your help, you see I did this shit without yours (hehe)

Creatures lie here looking through the windows
Monster, there are voices
In the darkness, and they say they won't go (yeah)
Stare long enough at the abyss and it seems to start to stare back at you
Lost inside my head, it's a scary place I've adapted to
Friends and family call and I tell 'em that, ""I'll get back to you""
Too busy on my phone, doom scrollin', spent the afternoon
Stressed out, head down, can barely leave my bed now
I hate thеse fucking feelings, they tell mе to try these meds out
But Doc, we've only talked for like ten minutes, I'm sketched out
Paranoid, can't tell if these people are foes or friends now
You know what it feels like to feel like nobody can help?
I talk but that I feel like you're losing yourself
I wouldn't even wish my enemies the hand I was dealt
Thought I could pave the paint to fame with some material wealth
But tears fallin' in the Tesla, I guess it's kind of ironic
Could feel so fucking broke inside somethin' I always wanted
My demons came to play, it feels like my brain they be hauntin'
Hate myself sometimes as much as they hate on me to be honest
I saw Fentanyl take the life away from my cousin
I watched alcohol steal the life away from my dad
I came from nothing, now I'm scared that might be what I'm becomin'
Look in the mirror, barely recognize the one lookin' back, so
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here looking through the windows
Monster, there are voices
In the darkness, and they say they won't go
Wrote a song when my dad passed, and they said it was trash
That made me wish that I put less of myself into every track
I know you can't just burn the orchard when one apple is bad
But the fact of the matter is that I feel I'm startin' to crack
And they say, ""Don't take it to heart"", well, how the fuck do I not?
When I put my soul inside somethin' and they say it's a flop
Constantly tear my art apart when this is all that I got
They wanna see me on a stage or me left in a grave to rot
I've been overstressin' 'bout overstressin'
I lie in bed and think about this life I'm manifestin'
Yeah, my depression's always yellin' that I'm destined for regression
Sad obsession with progression, still they think that I'm just desperate for attention
Broke dead about around this time, just last fall
At therapy tellin' my therapist I feel so small
Pushed everyone I love away, and fuck, it's all my fault
Is it better to feel like this or to feel nothin' at all?
I turned the lights down lonely
Remember back when we were cashing cans at the grocery?
Right there when I was drowning, but they're first to say, ""You know me""
So sick of people saying that they care and never show me
My grandpa once told me that inside an empty mind is where the devil likes to play
And everyday it's all the same, I just stare at an empty page
Ruminatin' 'bout all the things that are piled up on my plate
Time I take control of my brain, no, I can't just pray this away, so
Monster, how should I feel?

Don't know your worst so love is something that you never felt and
Your parents split so you don't even know if love is real, no
It's Friday night, your local dive got you diving back in
All these other men around all they are are practice
Daddy's money it don't make up for the sense you're lacking
And you tell your friends you're happy but we know you're acting
You don't know why, all you want is emotion
Another night, feeling empty and broken
A couple things you still needing to cope with
You're not alone, just know you're not alone
And you've been feeling hopeless now you're looking back like you own this
Like you own it, own it
And you've been feeling lonely so you're telling me put it on me, put it on me
And you've been sitting at the bar with eleven of your girls
Girl, I know you'll break my heart (break my heart)
Yeah, you've been looking like my ex, leave that ass on read
I might hit her with the XOXO
Don't play, you say you need to change but you don't change

You're feeling numb but me I'm colder than December, feel ya
I put you down like I ain't sitting at the same bar too
I talk about how you're a hoe but I play my part too
The DJ put on something for you to play my heart to
And I've been looking around the room and all I see is you
I don't know how, you still keep your composure
With all the weight that you hold on your shoulders

Want to say thank you to them
They gave us reasons to leave
Lost faith in falling in love
You came and made me believe
I've got hurt in my heart, deep
You'd have to fucking rip it out to see I'm insecure
I can't stop obsessing on my successes
No matter what I do I just never could see my blessings
So every conversation you try to gage where my head is
Cause it never seems to be on the top
And we're dissecting
We're spending our time on everything other than me and you
When I start to feel the pressure
You feel the pressure times two
We fight, you start to cry
I feel like I'm coming unglued
I walk away when really all I want to say is that I love you
Once again my stubbornness has got the best of me
When I want to get under your skin, I know the recipe
We're on the same team
Don't need to treat you like the enemy
I tell you that I'm fine
That's when you say you're testing me, I know you're testing me
I, I should probably let you in but I don't know how
I should probably let you win but I can't back down

Surrounded by a million people
Only feel like when you're there is when I'm not alone
Get off your fucking phone you say, you're rude for no reason
I want to tell you that I'm sorry
Yah, I tell you I'm leaving
You say you love the real me, even when I don't believe it
I said some shit I didn't mean
You say, why don't you repeat it, motherfucker
Now why don't you think about what you said
Instead of saying I love you, I'm going out with my friends
Instead of saying I love you, I say I'm going to bed
I hate the fact that they're sad so the battles
Inside your head killing my egos become bigger than my heart
I wanna end this fucking fight, it's just I don't know where to start
So you don't treat me like a product, you appreciate the art
I want you to know I care about you and it's easy and it's hard
I know it's hard but
If everything were to crash
I wouldn't give a single second that I spent with you back
So you make me a better me, you're everything that I lack

If you want the change, you gotta be the change
Now we're all the same
Nobody wanna take the reins, nobody wanna push their brain
Nobody will admit that they're fake for the facts they claim
You see we're all imperfect in a perfect way
And while we work all day, we're all work no play
We're slaved to the loans and the bills we pay
You consume a double cheese when the radio play
Mainstream, Mickey D's and my shit gourmet
I've been up for seven days straight
Trying to figure out my fate
Trying to figure out any way to put food on my plate
But I sold a few tee's so I'm eating today
Okay, I'm doing okay, could probably do better
Came home to a letter, eviction
I know I don't fit your description of a rapper
But me I'm a clearer, they threw all the cheddar
I know everything that glitter ain't gold
Life is the clay, you too busy to mold
Time here is taking it's toll
We spend all our time without passion and then we get old
Was told, I should go quit
But none of you see all the letters I get from these kids
Who hurt from within and don't wanna live
And tell me my music is all that can give them hope

Held down by a string, y'all looking for things
I'm looking to change the perception of people and all of the beautiful things that it brings
Yeah, record in my closet, don't make enough profit
Y'all used to have morals and somehow you lost it
Don't care about the money I spend on my coffin
I care bout the people attending
And often we're lost, lost in this world
We're selfish to think, I could find happiness in a girl
We're selfish to think we're elite, we destroy and deplete
Our whole planet no smarter than squirrels
So who wants to talk about that? Who wants to talk about facts
Maybe I'd be in your mag if I added tunechi or bap-bap
Or I talked about weed when I rap
But fuck all of that, the voice of the youth
The voice of the people, the real and the truth
The voice of the one who had nothing to lose
I speak for a heart that's been broken and beaten and bruised
I'm tired of holes in my shoes
Tired of having to move, tired of coming unglued
Tired of cleaning your table and serving you food
We are what we choose, if only you knew the shit that I've seen
I can't tell if I'm lucid or living the dream
I don't do it for me, do it all for the team
I remember back living when I was a teen
And my grandma she said I was worthless
And my teachers said I had no purpose
And my mama she said I was perfect
I'm sitting on Twitter while I should be working on verses

Sometimes I pick up on signs that you sent to show that you're near me
Sometimes I think about life after death and question the theories
I miss your smile and your voice, I still remember it clearly
I wrote a song called last letter, I put the volume on max
I wonder if you look down on my life and get a good laugh
And then tell Grandma and the others that you're proud you're my dad
I wish I'd cherished every single fuckin' moment we had
Now it's too late
So many things I wish I said, just never had time to say
How can you feel so close from a million miles away
It's crazy what can change in a year, a month or a day

It took too long to get you the help that you really needed

It's feelin' like something's jabbed in my back
The car's spinnin', my whole body's cut and covered in glass
And when we stop, I see my stomach slowly turnin' to black
That made me realize my whole life is truly fragile at best
Sometimes I stress until I physically feel pain in my chest
I ruminate, that's like my mind is always stuck on reset
I heard my grandma's fightin' cancer, Mom just sent me a text
I know we always butted heads and never saw eye to eye
But at this rate, I've seen too many in my family die
Apologize for holding grudges, such a waste of my time
So I just wanna say I love you while you're here and alive
Some people don't know the difference of being human and human-being

Don't know if you know
The lower your self-esteem goes, the more that these companies make
The more of yourself that you hate
The more that you look to replace, the more you'll be willing to pay
This hole got me stuck in a game
That you didn't even realize you were playin', so
It's okay to feel the way you do
Swimming in a love that they gave you
You drown
But they will never love you like I do
In this ocean, you're all I see
The truth is, you're as beautiful as beautiful gets
Wish you knew your flaws were just a shift in perception
Away from them being a gift
Does the dopamine hit when you post?
Worth it when you know people pick apart all of your pics?
You're sick of the comments that say, ""Does she even respond?""
When you don't, then they call you a bitch
It's just how it is, it's sad, it's true, man
Think we forgot what it means to be human
These apps are detrimental to our mental health
So we go buy an app to improve it
And call that ""improvement,"" but I digress
I know you're livin' with a lot of stress
Tryin' your best to find the line between work and rest
Haven't found it yet, damn
They see you were thick in the head
But not what goes on in your head, damn, yeah
Ask you how you are in the sheets
But not why you're not leavin' bed, damn, yeah
They sit there and stare at your lips
But don't hear a thing that you said, damn, yeah
They come out the woodwork
And then they get mad when you leave 'em on read
I know that you no longer wanna pretend
Like all the bullshit hasn't taken its toll
You're tired of strivin' to be what they want you to be
When you know you just don't fit the mold
""Sit there and look pretty"" is what you were told
By someone you used to consider a friend
You ask him, ""How am I supposed to feel pretty
With all of these hideous thoughts in my head?""
Never saw him again, at first you were hurt
That they thought your image was all you were worth
But then you realized you were wasting your time
On opinions of people who make you feel worse
You feel like you're cursed, you wanna move on
Remove every contact you have in your phone
You realize the more and more people pretend like they love you
The more you feel like you're alone, just know
It's okay to feel the way you do
Swimming in a love that they gave you
You drown
But they will never love you like I do
In this ocean
(They will never love you like I do)
They will never love you like I do
(Swimming in a love that they gave you)
(You drown)
(They will never love you like I do)
They will never love you like I do

Fallen,If You Don't Like the Story Write Your Own,https://open.spotify.com/album/1rKIT2C7BONrvYegtGjeAp,2022,916334,"Yeah
Kinda crazy to think at one point I didn't know who you were
Now we can't go to sleep without you stealin' my shirt
And we can't eat without you stealin' off of my plate first
Last night, you asked why I love you and I choked on my words
I wasn't the first to get to feel the warmth of your love
But I'm grateful that I'm here and not whoever it was
And I'm thankful that in you I found someone I can trust
Head over heels in love and realized I don't tell you enough
So, it's the way that you achieved
Everything they said that you couldn't
The way that you're still you even when nobody is lookin'
The way that you could have anybody and chose me
It's that inflection in your voice
When you're doin' somethin' you shouldn't
It's the way you give and never ask for anything back
The way you show me love in ways that nobody else ever has
The way you always seem to pick up my slack
Don't think that any song I'll ever
Write will sound as good to me as your laugh
See, it's the way you went above and beyond for my mom's wedding
The way that when you win, you can never let me forget it
The way you always take the ride with me to see my dad
No, you never got to meet him but desperately wish you had
See, it's the way you make up songs and you belt 'em out in the shower
Then tell me you'll write my album, you'll have it done in an hour
You're funny, you always put makin' memories over money
My favorite moments in life are the moments you say you love me, so
Show me your real love (I've fallen for you, I've)
(Fallen-fallen-fallen, fallen-fallen-fallen)
Show me your real love (I've fallen for you, I've)
(Fallen-fallen-fallen-fallen-fallen, fallen-fallen-fallen)
(Show me your real love)
(Fallen-fallen-fallen, fallen-fallen-fallen)
(Fallen-fallen-fallen-fallen-fallen, fallen-fallen-fallen)
(Show me your real love, love)
(Show me your real love, love)
Yeah, you're the one that taught me
Home is not somewhere, it's someone
I cherish all the memories we make, but I never wanna become one
To you, used to stay up on the phone until two
No need to post about your love on the Net when it's true
The only person that I wanna prove my love to now is you
It's the little things you do, how you light up every room
Set the bar over the moon, wanna tell you I'm proud
'Cause I've seen you hit rock bottom and you clawed your way out
You figured it out when others would've threw in the towel
I know how easy it can be to be consumed by your doubt
The past me used to dream about the things I have now
But any plaque I have still don't compare to seein' you smile
And that's real, I'm just spillin' how I feel
Never one that could commit, that's why I never signed a deal
But you changed me, don't think I ever told you, but you saved me
I wanna tell you why I love you 'cause I haven't lately
It's the way you write me notes when I have to leave for a trip
I love the feel of your touch, I love the taste of your lips
Just being with you is bliss, I love our drives to the city
They never feel as long as long as you're there with me, so
(Show me your real love)
I used to only think about numbers and winning Grammys
But lately, I've been thinkin' 'bout you and me and a family
We haven't scratched the surface of everything that we can be, so
(Show me your real love)
I love the bond I built with your sister, brother, and parents
The best part about all of this is we didn't plan it
See, you deserve the stars, the sun, the moon, and the planets, so
(Show me your real love)

You feel like my love was a lie
Like how could I spend so much time just to leave you behind?
Damn
All your things are on the kitchen counter
You're the type to think your point will matter
More than mine if you're the one to say it louder
I don't think that we should waste another hour
We were milk and honey, now we're sweet and sour
I can't fix it this time with wine and flowers

Was for your birthday, before you
Hurt me the worst way, I wonder what's gettin' into me
I wonder if your drink's in his mouth, tasting like victory
I wonder why at night every lie still plays like a symphony, I
Can barely focus, you never cared, I was broken
Been hurting since my dad passed, bet you wouldn't have noticed
'Cause you were busy blacked out, stumblin', losin' focus
Surrounded by all that's hopeless in life that you never chose
And here I go again, preachin' like I know who you are
Too busy stuck inside your phone to ever notice the stars
I miss the nights we'd sing Adele in your car
And had you wetter than the tears that you would cry if we're discussing your scars
I know your demons carry weight, don't know what it's like to be you
Know myself from the bottom, don't know what it's like to need you
You lied from the beginning, don't know what it's like to read you
My dad passed away and that day I flew out to see you
Remember? I'm thinkin' back to December
And how we talked about forever, now we talk less than never
I can't lie, sometimes I find myself re-reading your letter
I'm not saying I was perfect, still, I wish I woulda treated you better
Better, better, better for me
How could you think this would be
Better, better, better for me?
How could you think this would be?
On and on and on again, I fear these voices in my head
That tells me it's all lies and I should let you go
On and on and on again, I hear this voice inside my head
That tells me it's alright and I should hold you close
If you don't know how many times
I forgive you just so I can keep you by my side
I don't know why we waste our time
Spending all our nights in this gorgeous lie
Now maybe time was just against us 'cause you had just been broken when I met ya
I tried to take your pieces, and put you all back together
But the truth is coming out, I feel your void when we're together
Not sayin' that I was better, you drink to relieve the pressure
I know, let's keep it real
I know you loved to lie, but do you find you love me still?
'Cause he will never love you, like I loved you and I promise that is real
You can delete all of our pictures, but you can't delete your feels
You should be easy to replace
But every meaningless conversation, I see your face
I'm tryin' to fill this hole in my heart that you fuckin' made
I'm trippin', should've known that I would never find my happiness in all of these women
I need to find it in myself, that's for damn sure
Almost been a year since I got you from the airport
Crazy how time flies, I'm tryin' to hold on while
I wait for your car like, ""Come out at the bar at night""
Now how could this be?
Better, better, better for me?
How could you think this would be?
Better, better, better for me?
How could you think this would be?
On and on and on again, I fear this voices in my head
That tells me it's all lies and I should let you go
On and on and on again, I hear this voice inside my head
That tells me it's alright and I should hold you close
You don't know how many times
I forgive you just so I can keep you by my side

I hate the fact that I feel nothing or I'm reeling in pain
I need to shake this fucking habit, so I try, but I can't
And I look down on other addicts when we're one and the same
Remember back, I'm pushin' twenty, those were simpler times
That's when we met, and ever since you're never far from my mind
I broke my ankle playin' ball, and so it's you I'm prescribed
And even through all of the pain, you make me feel I could fly
A couple weeks, and now you're gone and now I'm feelin' the stress
I always wanted to feel something, maybe nothing is best
My friends and family start to question if I'm feelin' depressed
But I don't really give a damn, just put me back on the meds
I've been lost in my head
My homie Jack said he dealt with the same shit
He said he started drinkin' to deal with the pain quick
All you need is a fifth and it's cool to remain lit
So he handed me a bottle, said, ""Take about eight sips""
I'm faded, but I wanna feel straight numb
So I drink the rest of the bottle, liquor burnin' my gums
Woke up the next day at around a quarter to one
My peers would say that ""Man I had fun, right?""
I've been lyin', I've been sayin' I'm fine
But I've been feeling low and I don't know why
Another night, I feel empty inside
Down bottle after bottle of whatever I find
Feel the weight lift off me
Someone tell my mom I'm sorry
I don't wanna lie, I've been losin' my mind
They tell me ""Take a pill"" until I feel alright
The present day been feelin' sick, think I'm just bidin' my time
I take a shot of somethin' strong to keep that shit off my mind
All my friends started families and they left you behind
And here I am drinkin' any can or bottle I find
My body took you in as blood and so we're never apart
Some real shit, you the closest someone's been to my heart
But just like everything I love, you fuckin' tear me apart
Just like everything I love, you fuckin' tear me apart
I wanna be there for my son, daughter, wife—I mean my ex-wife now
I guess that time really flies when you're drunk on the couch
I wanna shake this fuckin' habit, I just don't know how
So you would love to see me sick until I almost drown
And so you keep me on the brink of barely livin' and death
As long as I'm alive, yeah, you know you're gettin' my cheque
You pray my son and daughter will follow me in my steps
You'll create our loves a fact that I'm broke and broken and in debt
Can go a day without food, I can't go a day without you
When I try, I get the shakes 'til my face turns blue
Lost my job, wife, life for a bottle of booze
You promised you would make me happy, we know that's not true
I tried every drug in the book, but they never hit me the same
I told my doc that I'm down, he put some pills in my name
It doesn't matter the problem, the fix is always the same
Always takin' the easy route, like I'm never willin' to change, damn
Now blamin' everybody but me
With you inside my system, everybody used to love me
But now my friends, family, my kids, they can't even trust me
Been losin' all my control and I let you fuckin' become me
No more! I said no fuckin' more!
I know you think I'm lyin', I said this to you before
This time I'm fuckin' ready, it's time to show you the door
This life is mine, it never was yours!
I've been lyin', I've been sayin' I'm fine
But I've been feelin' low and I don't know why
Another night, I feel empty inside

I had fell asleep with the TV on
I said ""Hey, you good?""
There was a brief pause
Then you said to me, ""He's fucking gone""
And my hands are shaking, my mind is racing
My heart is aching, don't know what to say
So I said the first thing that came to mind
Which was something like, ""You're gonna be okay""
""You're gonna be okay?"" What a foolish phrase
Like your whole life's not about to change
And your only options are to sit in pain
Or become so numb, you can't feel a thing
And the days will change, but they'll feel the same
You wanna run away, but you can't escape
Going nowhere fast down the interstate
Only say all that 'cause I know the pain
And to feel like you wanna disappear
I hope you know that I'm always here
The sad truth is I can't bring him back, but can lend an ear, so
You don't have to hurt alone, hurt alone
I can't fix it, but you won't be by yourself
And I know I'll never know, never know
What you've been through, all the messed up things you felt
But I could stay down, heavy in the pain, no
We don't have to talk if the words don't help
You don't have to hurt alone, hurt alone
I can't fix it, but you won't be by yourself
Yeah, I used to think, ""Damn, I wish I had a fam,"" until I realized that I had two
There's the one assigned to me out the womb, and the one that I got to choose
So know that you're fam to me, and for family, there's not much that I wouldn't do
Been losing your sanity, understandably, and the only way out's to go through
But they say you grow through what you go through
The truth is that I owe you
You were my lifeline in my dark times
Now it's my turn to console you
Even though I know the truth is nothing will
This trauma's gonna take some time to heal
I know the war of losing someone close
Still, I'll never know the way you truly feel, damn
But if you need to vent, or not be alone in your head
Just name the time and the place, I'll be on my way, I'm not one to just leave you on read
'Cause that's what you do for your friends and people you love
You don't let 'em drown when they wanna give up
And trust me, I know how hard it can be finding someone you can trust, but
You don't have to hurt alone, hurt alone
I can't fix it, but you won't be by yourself
And I know I'll never know, never know
What you've been through, all the messed up things you felt
But I could stay down, heavy in the pain, no
We don't have to talk if the words don't help
You don't have to hurt alone, hurt alone
I can't fix it, but you won't be by yourself
Don't know if you've ever thought of trying therapy
It's helped me find a little clarity
Been learning not to care about opinions from people who won't be there when they bury me
I was so desperate, I booked a session
Clicked the first place Google recommended
Someone answered and asked me a couple questions
Told her, ""Ma'am, I can't fix this depression""
I don't want attention, wanna run away
Said she couldn't see me 'til the 28th
That was twenty days, was thinking, ""Oh, okay, that's a lot of time when you're about to break""
I was about to break, I needed fucking help
I couldn't do it all by my-fucking-self
Hate the stigma put on my mental health
Society taught me how to hate myself
But I'm still breathing
Still speaking, heart still beating
Countless nights battling with demons
And I'm still here, guess I'm undefeated
And I was thinking, this could help
Maybe in my story you can find yourself
Hard to understand the hand that you were dealt
You don't owe shit to anyone except yourself
Yeah, accept yourself, know he's looking down
And just like me, know he's fucking proud
Your anxiety is gonna chop you down
Until you start believing that you let him down
But never let it win, the battle starts within
It's where you go from here, not where you begin
It's a blessing to call you a friend, and to know that you let me in, so
You don't have to hurt alone, hurt alone
I can't fix it, but you won't be by yourself",https://open.spotify.com/track/4PlS5NXbix1A37dQvkxfFi,245
Losing You (feat. Max),I Could Not Plan This,https://open.spotify.com/album/4dR2U031e2XkziQH53khB9,2017,25911892,"Yeah
Another night, I can barely sleep, I pray to God my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake, I pray to God my soul to take
I pray to God I'll be over-great
Not another wack rapper that they overrate
Y'all spoiled like the South in the Florida State
I'm always overworked and never overpaid
But I prayed for it, yeah
And when they told me that I couldn't, man, I had to find a way for it, yeah
Serve a table everyday, had to find a way to pay for it, damn
And when I started goin' numb is when I realized I was made for it, yeah
So it's ""fuck all my feelings,"" I feel like the villain
Feel like I overstepped boundaries, feel like you're better without me
Feel like I'm drowning, feel like I never had found me
I don't want no one around me
I don't think nobody knows how it feels when there's so many people yet no one to listen
I try to good with the talent I'm given
I try to see clear, yet attention's been blockin' my vision
Surrounded by fake—and, honestly—lately, debate how much more I can take
A couple more shots to the face
I often don't drink, so I'm searching for something to chase
She's putting my hands on her waist
Her tongue's in my mouth and I wonder what pain she can taste
I'm taking caffeine when I'm wake and tired of taking the pill with PM just to sleep when it's late, I dont
I don't know what to believe in
Did it all for the wrong reasons
And now I'm picking up the pieces
Of that person, I was more
I've been losing you, you
You, you
I've been losing you
I guess I've lost me for a while, well, welcome back
Lately I've forgot how a smile felt, now picture that
Thought that I could buy happy
Maybe buy a new car in all black
Put the whole entire team on the map
Everything I have now, had to work for all that
But, to see my dad again, I would give it all back
They just want me to rap
I feel like a slave to this shit
I know that I pray for this shit
But if I have one more fake convo with one more fake person, I might just go ape in this shit
Remembering back, we had no place to live
And you spent my rent money on clothes that you wear
And confusing your Instagram followers for people who care
And you'll never find happy when stuck in comparin', I know
I miss the feeling of feeling feelings
Now every song I write I've been dripping and oozin' real, and
I try to tell my story, yeah, feelin is less appealin'
Them rappers that like to mumble and already hit the ceiling, so fuck
Didn't fuck with me way back then, now it's ""Hey, what's up?""
Is it weird that I still feel stuck?
Think it's funny when I spill my guts 'cause I feel?
Feelin' like I need to stop playing, he's real
I spent last week in bed and the weekend was drunk
'Cause I honestly just couldn't deal
It's been seven days now without you, that makes one week
You turn into someone else after just one drink
Wonder if I'm on your mind when you think
And, honestly, I tried to help you find you—and instead lost me
I don't know what to believe in
Did it all for the wrong reasons
And now I'm picking up the pieces
Of that person, I was more
I've been losing you, you
You, you
I've been losing you",https://open.spotify.com/track/4mkuteIXG9CYuSRDvti0S3,236
Piece of Mind 3,Dreaming With Our Eyes Open,https://open.spotify.com/album/0x8V30SsjfBNY2PuQ9TO3w,2015,7858792,"You love hearing me vent, this is no heat from the vent
When the rent due, you don't know what I've been through
When we can't afford lights, I write in the dark with a paper I'm putting my pen to
Try to fuck with my mental, said my potential is minimum wage
Majority die before twenty five, forty years later we're put in a grave
I'm filled up with rage
This is the culture you sent me to save, society stuck in a cage
Remembering back in the day, feeling so real when I ride while I bump Kanye but damn
Real turned into Photoshopped Kim K
Everyday when they wake up, girls cake up on your make up all over their face
They think its okay, they're fucking their way to the top
They see all your money and stare at their waist
They throw up their dinner not knowing you fake
They'll never compare to those pics that you take
And this is the world that you fucking create
A world that your daughter can't even escape
So you were the one that was left to decay
A world in which I have been sent here to save, then 'Ye
I think were on the same page, cause I've been jackin' off to Kim since I was in the fifth grade
You see you show us how to live, but its a fib to get payed
Now Mr. West I got a question, who are the new slaves
See what media made, the pawn of the game is slaved up with T.V and radio playing
I ain't pointing the blame
I ain't pointing the blame, cause it all don't hang on you
I'm a slave of the truth and that's the point that I need you to prove
Well, we're slaved to a label, and its funny that labels are slaved to the youth
So why can't you see all the power in you
Kid from your class couldn't pass but he drew, till it turned into music you're listening to
Now we 're changing the world, motherfucking IQ
Walked in the label like yo what it do
So give me a mil, better off make it two
Creative control in a bowl full of stew
So you can ask Dan he was there with me too
Ugh, I don't like this dude, I ain't signing shit
Ten writers who can barely write a hit
Compare me too, check the writer list
There are images who the industry will use as a fucking tool just to get more hits
Do you get it yet, I'm sick of the lying
Indie when really your signed, making it hard for real indie art like mine
Money don't grow on a tree like pine
Lying to fans, robbing them blind, keeping them buying by keeping them blind
Airing you out it's a matter of time, stuck in a bind you can't buy time
Can't buy time, open your legs and never the mind
You're Looking for head and never inside
We're looking to find attention online
We only see surface we're lame and we're dry
Placing our value in things that we buy
We staring at ass, it's never enough
We're so disconnected from being alive
From being alive, so disconnected from being alive
Take a look in my eyes, then in my soul and see what you find
Yeah I used to get bullied so bad I would sit in my room and I'd cry
Now the same motherfucker like Mark where is the song I could buy
Now open your eyes, human but more like a virus
Greedy is spineless
Take from the earth and we fill it with violence
Take and we take we're the same as a tyrant
Never been silent
Learn what we know from a Facebook post
It's a joke now we're looking so mindless
Stupid we seem to define it
On the same boat, when they think we would sink then we fight it
Love is the only thing timeless
Live in an era where we value weed over love
So you can buy a drug but you can't buy love
So you can buy a bottle but you can't buy grub
So you can buy class doesn't mean you're not dumb
Most the people I know, they would rather feel numb
And so tell me when was the last time you had fun, other then when you fuck and turn up at the club
Man I'm sick of this wack shit, You're faker than Iggy Azalea's accent
You have to live in the past tense, me I'm the future in everything I put to action
What's a rap god to a rapping assassin
No one has mentioned my passion
Power through tinder you're looking for action
Now at the club and you're pounding the captain
Never found passion, living in fraction, lonely and asking what your life could be
Now when life gets hard you don't fight but instead you gon' light the weed
So you spend four years and you work real hard to go get a degree
Now you're working a five nine to five and you're chasing another man's dream
Most of us settle it seems, girl you're worth more than you fucking attempt for the guys
Nothing more precious than time, nothing more tragic then dying while being alive
We look at the sky, know that one day we'll decay in the dirt we let die
I'm here to deliver you all from the lies
And know that I gave you a piece of my, mind",https://open.spotify.com/track/3ycwGAW1B8Pn7ixNzTwH7D,213
Happier,If You Don't Like the Story Write Your Own,https://open.spotify.com/album/1rKIT2C7BONrvYegtGjeAp,2022,1078510,"Hold the pain, keep it silent
Hold the pain, keep it silent
No, my time only runnin' out
'Bout the way that I'm smilin'
Can nobody see I'm down?
Do my best to be okay
But that's all my feelin's allow
These thoughts slip from me always
All I think is how
Now nothin' feels the same
No, nothin' feels the same
Searching for where I belong
I just wanna be happier
Now, nothin' feels the same
No, nothin' feels the same
Learning from where I went wrong
I just wanna be happier (Yeah), yeah
The more I learn, the more I realize how much I have left to learn
Remember back when seven fifty an hour was all I earned
And Mom was workin' overtime, just tryna make things work
So every bill that came in the mail came with concern
I thought maybe a degree could change some things for her and me
Was even honored by the dean, that didn't matter at all
I bought the lie they sold to me at the expense of my own dreams
Said they had everything I need, just need to pay for it all
Well, fuck that
They used to tell me, ""Fuck rap, you need to take a step back
Look in the mirror, Mark, and look at yourself""
They almost had me thinkin' I should put my dreams on the shelf
They don't believe in me just like they don't believe in themselves
I took that chip and then I wore it proudly
Along the way I became fixated on those who doubt me
Somehow lost sight of all the blessings that were all around me
I let comparison and pressure almost fuckin' drown me
Was lost until I found me
I treated the world like it owed me
My self-worth came from comments from people that didn't know me
Feelin' lonely, feelin' like I let everybody else down
Barely recognizin' anyone now, and all I think is-
All I think is how
Now nothin' feels the same
No, nothin' feels the same
Searching for where I belong
I just wanna be happier
Now, nothin' feels the same
No, nothin' feels the same
Learning from where I went wrong
I just wanna be happier
I wanna partake in this rat race, don't have a lot but have faith
And how can I create when my mind is in such a bad place?
I finally made some money, but more issues is what that made
Remember thinkin' that I'll be happy once I reach that place
But not so much, I did it, I felt the rush
But on the way, I left some people and things I love in the dust
That's when I finally realized how now enough is never enough
I wear the smile on my face and nobody has called my bluff
I'm honest, I may have added some commas
But what's naïve to think that money could alleviate problems
I let the numbers become all the validation I seek
Now I know showin' my emotions doesn't mean that I'm weak
Despite what others may think
And maybe all along happiness was a choice
And I listened to their opinions instead of my inner voice
The old me just really wanted the world to love and respect me
Now I'm sick of livin' life for everybody except me
So don't text me, all I want is to fuckin' live in the moment
Should appreciate the journey a little more and I know it
Kept around the ones I trust and cut everybody else out
Barely recognizin' anyone now, and all I think is-
All I think is how
Now nothin' feels the same
No, nothin' feels the same
Searching for where I belong
I just wanna be happier
Now, nothin' feels the same
No, nothin' feels the same
Learning from where I went wrong
I just wanna be happier
Searchin' for where I belong
I just wanna be happier now

Tourist,Dreaming With Our Eyes Open,https://open.spotify.com/album/0x8V30SsjfBNY2PuQ9TO3w,2015,15070127,"And I know that we just met
I love the way you take it off
When I break down on your ass
And you're taking of the memories we made
I'll hope you take it all with you
I'm a tourist just like you
Did you went into my life for whatever
Forever feeling like you could do better
Better than me, I'm wishing oh T
Wishing you stayed but today is the day that you leave
As you packing your bags I'm watching you leave
Reading back over your letter to me
You got tears in your eyes
You can't hide it from me
Both our noses are running
While fighting to breathe
And I'm looking in the mirror like Mark
Got a cold heart how'd it get this far
How'd it get this hard?
Never letting anybody in
Now you're spilling your feelings all over the car
Europe is feeling like mars
Both of us know that I shoot for the stars
Check through your baggage you're packing a piece of my heart
Knew it was over before it could start
Damn, now all that I see are the memories
That me and you could achieve in a short time
Together a reason to season forever
You came in and left like the weather
Both you and I know less than no better
Remember the moment I met her
Forgive me for making you wait for my letter
I'm writing this song cause I told her
I'd never forget her, and I know
And I know that we just met
But yes, I love the way you take it off
When I break down on your ass
Wanna have it all
And now you're taking of the memories we made
I hope you sail, I hope you take it all with you
I'm a tourist just like you
And I know that we just met
But yes, I love the way you take it off
When I break down on your ass
Wanna have it all
And now you're taking of the memories we made
I hope you sail, I hope you take it all with you
I'm a tourist just like you
And I think I lost me while I try to find you
Remembering back to the night that we met
Came to my show and you stayed for my set
I'm puking and spilling all over my chest
Sometimes I admit I'm a mess
I fuck other rappers, you fuck with the best
Came all by your morals and buying a dress
Came all by your life and the likes on your breasts
I'm fucking impressed, see love is something that's been over my head
Or fuck if I do it again, and me, I'm no more than a tourist supporting a friend
I care 'bout the time that we spend, I don't want to pretend
Trying to find the line that defines that you're more than a friend
It's funny they say times is money, when time is the only thing that we don't spend
I did it again, I build up a wall with a tight rope to my heart
And I hope you don't fall, we've been through it all
I sit here and wait for your call
But settling down I don't think that we're ready at all
I'm busy I'm chasing a passion, looking back
Asking how did this happen and how is it now
That I found all the feelings I'm lacking
A tourist of time and our time isn't lasting
I know that we just met
But yes, I love the way you take it off
When I break down on your ass
Wanna have it all
And now you're taking of the memories we made
I hope you sail, I hope you take it all with you
I'm a tourist just like you
And I know that we just met
But yes, I love the way you take it off
When I break down on your ass
Wanna have it all
And now you're taking of the memories we made
I hope you sail, I hope you take it all with you
I'm a tourist just like you
I don't wanna watch you
Fly away
I don't wanna watch you go
Tell me where you stay
I don't wanna watch you, wanna watch you
Fly away",https://open.spotify.com/track/0NIboN7iVLUM33gBwF0eTe,218
