Guilty,Calvin Court,https://open.spotify.com/album/36Dm8jfwU9m7373RfMsBRr,2021,152601,"I have lost my way
Yet I'm here to say
I'm holding on
In my darkest hour
You're still reaching out
But the feeling's gone
I'm guilty to be human
Cause I just keep on losing
Myself in all the music
And I know I tried my best to be heard
Maybe these are my last words
Now you might've guessed
The reasons why I've left
But I just can't explain
Why I'm hurting you
Oh, I'm hurting too
I'm just not the same
I'm guilty to be human
Cause I just keep on losing
Myself in all the music
And I know I tried my best to be heard
Maybe these are my last words
Oh, I'm only human
I don't know what I'm doing
I'm guilty to be human
Cause I just keep on losing
Myself in all the music
And I know I tried my best to be heard
Baby, these are my last word

Five (Minute Friend),Calvin Court,https://open.spotify.com/album/36Dm8jfwU9m7373RfMsBRr,2021,265808,"I met a girl on an empty train
In the middle of the night
I could feel her eyeing me from across the car
But never did enter my sight
She asked where I was going
I misheard and said my name
She laughed for a moment
Then did the same
And as the door slid open
I looked around
And wondered if she would leave
Whooo Whooo baby
Take a ride with me
Whooo Whooo baby
Underneath the city streets
Oh, and I know it sounds crazy
But I didn't want it to end
Oh, I was falling in love with my
1-2-3-4-5-minute friend
Coming into the west coast
Had déjà vu right on her skin
I was trying to do everything I could to keep my cool
When she asked"" how you been?""
With her blue eyes begging
One thing led to the next
While waiting for our bags down at LAX
We stepped away
To where the music played
And as the door slid open
She looked around
And wondered if I would leave
Whooo Whooo baby
Take a ride with me
Whooo Whooo baby
Underneath the city streets
Oh, and I know it sounds crazy
But I didn't want it to end
Oh, I was falling in love with my
1-2-3-4-5-minute friend
Whoa Ah La La
(Ah La La)
Whoa
(Woo got me singing now)
Whoa Ah La La La La La La
Hey
Whooo Whooo baby
Baby
Take a ride with me
(Take a ride with me)
Whooo Whooo baby
(Baby)
Oh underneath the city
Underneath the city streets
I know it sounds crazy
(Crazy)
But I didn't want it to end
(Oh no)
Oh, I was falling in love
I was falling in love with my
1-2-3-4-5
Minute friend
Oh, she's alright
(She's alright)
Oh yeah, she's alright

Foolish,Calvin Court,https://open.spotify.com/album/36Dm8jfwU9m7373RfMsBRr,2021,3034901,"Feeling lonely, but that's alright
At least that's what I tell myself to get me through the night
I know I'm lost, but that's okay
Maybe I don't wanna be found anyway
I think about you every now and then
Wonder if you miss me or laugh about me to your friends
They said we were pretty good together
But we're they wrong
♪
I couldn't fall asleep tonight because of you
And I know it isn't right to call and say I broke your heart in two
I know that you loved me more than you showed
But I was foolish to think that I'd stop loving you
Soon as I let you go
I go out like everything's fine
Maybe even treat myself to something finer than wine
But no one leads me home to bed like you do
I'm craving you
I couldn't fall asleep tonight because of you
Oh and I, know it isn't right to call and say I broke your heart in two
I know that you loved me more than you showed
But I was foolish to think that I'd stop loving you
Soon as I let you go
But I'm not over you
It's true

(You're gonna like this. Check it)
Waking up on the bright side of the bed
With you
Made 2 am love that neither one of us regret
Oooo
In a couple hours we'll go separate way
Not telling anybody that we're on the same page
We got everybody thinking that we're just friends
But what they don't know is that you and me go crazy on a Monday morning
Laying it low, keeping it quiet don't want anyone knowing
You leave with me, sleep with me
Can't get you out of my head
Got that undercover love
in and out of the bed
Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh
Stop (Don't stop) let me catch my breath
Just looking at you makes me wanna release some stress
Honestly I bet we might've skipped a few steps
Right into ripping the sheets off instead
We got everybody thinking that we're just friends
But what they don't know is that you and me go crazy on a Monday morning
Laying it low, keeping it quiet don't want anyone knowing
You leave with me, sleep with me
Can't get you out of my head
Got that undercover love
In and out of the bed
Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh
They know that we're always talking, they know that you're making me laugh
They know that there must be something happening behind their backs
They know that we ain't always social, but we know how to have a good time
They know that they might need help reading between the lines
But what they don't know is that you and me go crazy on a Monday morning
Laying it low, keeping it quiet don't want anyone knowing

Spinning around again
You need someone to talk you down
You're wanting the touch of her hand
But she's not here no more
You're not here no more
So why you keep coming back?
Round and round and round we go
Round and round and round we go
Round and round and round until I can't see straight
Fall back into your arms for another mistake
Lying
You're lying so close to me
The breathlessness is killing me
Oh and I just you to leave
But I can't let you go
I want to let you go
But who would I be?
Oh oh Round and round and round we go
Round and round and round we go
Round and round and round until I can't see straight
Fall back into your arms for another mistake
Go to someone else arms, look into someone else's eyes
Play with someone else heart, mess with someone else's mind
Touch someone else's hips, kiss someone else's lips
I'm done crying your tears again and again, when you won't cry for me.
I wish you'd cry for me
But round and round and round you go
Round and round and round you go
Round and round and round until you can't see straight

That haven't happened yet
I think of all the places I would go if I could just afford it
And hey, I'm not gonna take it
When they say I won't make it
Cause I'll make it
As the world gets warmer, people stay cold
They're just cannon fodder, chipping away at their souls
If you think I'm losing the fight
I'll get back up
Cause I'm unbreakable
I don't get hurt like I used to
Cause now I finally understand
If I kept every promise I made to myself
I'd be a different man
But hey, I'm not gonna take it
When they say I won't make it
I'll make it
As the world gets warmer, people stay cold
They're just cannon fodder, chipping away, chipping away
If you think I'm losing the fight
I'll get back up
Cause I'm unbreakable
Unbreakable
I don't need the pain and sorrow
I won't give up on tomorrow
As the world gets warmer, people stay cold
They can say I'm wrong
