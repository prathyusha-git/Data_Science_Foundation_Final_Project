A.K.A. Zeltron, A.K.A. Big Ultra
Y'all niggas don't know what the fuck it is
When a real nigga step into a room with some alligator shoes on
'Cause you know we straight out the swamp, straight out the Everglades
Out of Florida, bitch-ass nigga
You feel me? Dade County, Get Sprayed County
Lauderdale or Slaughterdale
You already know what the fuck it is
Ay, Peggy, let me talk to 'em one time, hold up
Niggas be beggin' for shit to be different until they get it, then they treat it indifferent
People projectin' they bullshit at you 'cause they dissatisfied with the life that they living
Niggas' net worth be like 17 bucks while they begging for feet pics from shorties I been in
I can sniff out you proximity hoes, always near some shit going on, but never did it
I don't understand when people talk shit on me, they gotta lead with a lie or some fibbing
Friends acting like they don't wanna talk, then start begging for change, I don't know what it's giving
Niggas be tryin' to fuck on your bitch while they dappin' you up sayin', ""I see your vision""
Fake friends turning on me for nothing, they mad 'cause they failed even with an advantage
This is my fight, I just woke up as a child of the light
Jumped on the beat, had to tell it, ""Goodnight""
Y'all tried your best but the heat aimin' right
Kimber OG, I'm as high as a kite
Shop for success, well, I brought me a pint
Watch how I whip, I ain't stir-fry the rice
Get your head cracked just for rollin' the dice, uh
Now don't believe hype
Believe what you see, not what's said on the mic
Peggy Chun-Li, I kick out every time
Can't keep me down, so they try block the shine
Try fuck with my money, try fuck with my mind
Then acting like fucking they bitch is a crime
This ain't relatable, this ain't debatable
Somethin' happened to you, it's by design, shh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, man
JPEG motherfuckin' MAFIA
Makin' grown men emotional since 2008, at least
Now, walk around everywhere as me, you know
And you never catch me out here lookin' like these dirty-ass underground rappers
Locked in the Airbnb somewhere with a bunch of niggas, playin' with each other's dicks
Zero women around, loopin' records nobody wants to hear
Uh, look
On my knees for a God who can hear
I can't pray to no God I can't fear
I think I should have ran me a cult
Quarterback that ho like I'm Peyton on Colts
Fuck-niggas yappin' 'bout me on they alt
But when I see you, it's degrees of assault
You said you see him, you catching a case?
I hope not like the one you got in your vault
'Cause that shit is shaky
Heard the church service said, ""Come as you are""
So I showed up with a whole bunch of bitches that hate me
Told my main bitch to stop actin' expensive
Girl, pass me the mic, you as clueless as Stacy
I know that time heals wounds, but my time is money and I can't use time as saline
Pray, for all of my enemies, they either dead or hating, literally faking
Lame-ass niggas get exposed every day, and I don't gotta do nothing more than frustrate him
He's not a threat, bitch, I'm on him, a vet
I had marksman in basic, I never need training
Ay, they make a career from hating
Ay, they make a career from faking
I shit-talked my way right into a bag
You pussy in private, beg him for collabs
You pillow-talkin' to these bitches, it's sad
I don't know whether to slap you or laugh

And now your real life is all that you left with
Now, baby, tell me, what did you achieve
You blamin' me for the problems that you blessed with

Sling out wack tracks and Pitchfork loves it
Critic-core legend, certified bitch-made
Asshole niggas, thinkin' they got the best taste
At 27, I'ma asphyxiate on my own bullshit
While I'm lookin' for a fix

'Cause I could be like you, a keyboard warrior
YouTube confessin' in the comment section
Dick gettin' hard off a thumbs up blessin'
And when you get ignored
It's like, ""Fuck, now I'm stressin'!""
I took the high road
Instead of bein' the nigga that talk shit
I'd rather be the nigga that walks it
Hop, skip and jump 'cause I'm rich as hell
Stick to the script like an actor
