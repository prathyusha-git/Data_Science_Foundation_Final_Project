Child, it's broke
And I feel you slipping away
Child, you spoke
And the world fell silent again
Do you love?
Do you need love?
Child, undone
By fear of falling through cracks
Child, by one mistake
You've lost your way back
Do you love? (Something's gotta turn you round)
Do you love?
Do you need love?
When your angels shout
Is your heart strung out?
Do you love?
Do you need love?
When your angels fall
Have you lost it all?
Child, be still
In the storm to wave us goodbye
Child, we will
Return to dance with the sky
Do you love? (Something's gotta turn you round)
Do you love?
Do you need love?
When your angels shout
Is your heart strung out?
Do you love?
Do you need love?
When your angels cry
Does your spirit die?
Something's gotta turn you round (Something's gotta turn you round)
Do you love?
Do you need love?
When your angels shout
Is your heart strung out?
Do you love?
Do you need love?
When your angels cry
Does your spirit die?
Do you love?
Do you need love?
When your angels shout
Is your heart strung out?
Do you love?
Do you need love?
When your angels fall
Have you lost it all?
Do you love?
Do you need love?
Do you love?
Do you need love?
Do you love?
Do you need love?
