Uncut with that top side (style)
My brain fried, don't do drugs
Had two plugs, one just died (style)
I'm up late, no talk show
Things pop up, we duck low (everything about JPEGs, I like)
Talk with a hoe, had a bank roll
Shop 'nother clothes if you wearin' it slow
Ain't no way, y'all niggas never did shit for me (shit for me)
Gave up off their stock, had the recipe (the recipe)
Nah, I do this for my legacy (my legacy)
Pop off with my dawg, I need an extra three
You ain't never seen no things, I use most everything
Make you wanna branch out and say fuck everything (uh-uh)

I ask the bitch, "Do you like that?" (Do you like that?)
My young nigga stеp for me
Like Mo Bamba in the paint (gеt to steppin')
You don't know shit about me, nigga, who is yo' man?

Love (love), my dick could roll it up
Make her real like Whitney in the bathtub, satisfied (style)
I be on my lonely, worry 'bout no gossip
Niggas pocket watchin', all within my wallet
Just keep it on the hush, hush
Hang tough, they ain't like us
Just hang yourself if you need help
Uh, back in this bitch with the dope
She backin' it up for a gram
Baby, I cannot do nothin' with hope
I'ma try molly and Xans
Been tryin' get me to ghost, boy, you ain't Kai
One Twitch and you banned
90 degrees for a coat, hoe and I ain't showin' my hands
Uh, I make it harder to breathe
My Kimber like my emotions
I keep 'em both in my sleeve
I need more time to myself
I don't need advice, I just need to be
Back in this bitch, what's the issue?
You bitches ain't barkin' when you off the leash
Fuck 'em

Uh, they don't got nothin' for me
It's like I been workin' for crumbs
Now I'm feelin' free as my speech
Colin Kaep', I'm a free agent
Cap the salary, free up my teams
Y'all rap like replacements
They can't find a replacement for me
When I stalk your page and I see you livin' life respectfully
And I tell myself, "You ain't know her worth," and I draft apologies (fuck)

Why they still put on a front and nobody knows them?
Don't like when I talk like this? (Nah)
'Cause they know that this shit is for them
These crackers love talkin' 'bout me
And actin' like it's my job to ignore them
