Look at us, we've come so far
Every road travelled says who we are
Like a tide, we rise and fall
We sail on, through the storm,
So many changes in my life
Every precious moment has a sacrifice
There were times when I stood alone
I found the strength to carry on
And when I thought the walls were closing in around me
Oh baby you were my fight
I was standing in the dark waiting for the light to shine on me
When you came into my life like a thousand angels watching over me
Well I have nowhere left to go
And I can't take it any more
You were right there in front of me
Now I'm holding out my heart, giving all I've got
'Cause you're part of me, let it shine on me
In a time where worlds collide
So many teardrops from a strangers eyes
There's an answer inside of you
Close your eyes, see the truth
Just when you think the walls are closing in around you
Oh baby I'll be your fight
I was standing in the dark waiting for the light to shine on me
When you came into my life like a thousand angels watching over me
Well I have nowhere left to go
And I can't take it any more
You were right there in front of me
Now I'm holding out my heart, giving all I've got
'Cause you're part of me, let it shine on me
You don't need to hide in the shadows alone
All you have to do is stand up, you're not on your own
Take a look around you babe
