Sell off the licensing rights to your mind
You'll sit through some ads before you can see the light
Life doesn't mean a thing until you've almost none
You could have been anyone
You can find Jesus in every thrift store
And you can catch hell, condemned by the Lord's billboards
Wildfires opalize the skies
While they try thinking of ways to monetize
Ways to monetize
Life doesn't mean a thing until you've almost none
You could have been anyone
