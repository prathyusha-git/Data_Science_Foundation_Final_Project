You know, I've been thinkin' 'bout the night we met
Stood there in the kitchen, smokin' cigarettes
4 a.m. is messy, so we went to bed
Now it's fuckin' with my head
I say it doesn't faze me, but I think about you daily
You want me, but only when we're gettin' wavy
Go mess around and you can find yourself another
'Cause I don't wanna be your after-party lover (after-party lover)
You know it gets easy when you're bored and drunk
The later that it gets, the more it seems like fun
I wake up in the morning, phone is blowin' up
Enough just ain't enough so
I get out of bed
It's messed up in my head
I cycle like our meds
To feel good off the sex
I fought to block his calls, his texts, the end
Hmm, since I seem lax
I say it doesn't faze me, but I think about you daily
You want me, but only when we're gettin' wavy
Go mess around and you can find yourself another
'Cause I don't wanna be your after-party lover
You say it's complicated whenever you're not wasted
I'm crazy, still want us to be datin'
Go mess around and you can find yourself another
'Cause I don't wanna be your after-party lover
(Increase the volume)
(Smash it up, don't know)
(When I lose ya)
