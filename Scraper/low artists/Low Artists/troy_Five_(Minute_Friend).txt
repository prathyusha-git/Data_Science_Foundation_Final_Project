I met a girl on an empty train
In the middle of the night
I could feel her eyeing me from across the car
But never did enter my sight
She asked where I was going
I misheard and said my name
She laughed for a moment
Then did the same
And as the door slid open
I looked around
And wondered if she would leave
Whooo Whooo baby
Take a ride with me
Whooo Whooo baby
Underneath the city streets
Oh, and I know it sounds crazy
But I didn't want it to end
Oh, I was falling in love with my
1-2-3-4-5-minute friend
Coming into the west coast
Had déjà vu right on her skin
I was trying to do everything I could to keep my cool
When she asked" how you been?"
With her blue eyes begging
One thing led to the next
While waiting for our bags down at LAX
We stepped away
To where the music played
And as the door slid open
She looked around
And wondered if I would leave
Whooo Whooo baby
Take a ride with me
Whooo Whooo baby
Underneath the city streets
Oh, and I know it sounds crazy
But I didn't want it to end
Oh, I was falling in love with my
1-2-3-4-5-minute friend
Whoa Ah La La
(Ah La La)
Whoa
(Woo got me singing now)
Whoa Ah La La La La La La
Hey
Whooo Whooo baby
Baby
Take a ride with me
(Take a ride with me)
Whooo Whooo baby
(Baby)
Oh underneath the city
Underneath the city streets
I know it sounds crazy
(Crazy)
But I didn't want it to end
(Oh no)
Oh, I was falling in love
I was falling in love with my
1-2-3-4-5
Minute friend
Oh, she's alright
(She's alright)
Oh yeah, she's alright
(She's alright)
Oh, my five-minute friend
Ooooo whoo whoo
