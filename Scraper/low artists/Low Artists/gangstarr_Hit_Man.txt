The, the, the, the hit man
His power is so great
That's for real
Ain't about a whole lotta talk
It's, it's, it's about, about, it's, it's about a-a-action, can you dig it?
He got the eye and the heart to do it, yeah
From the roof with a scope, there's a whole art to it
Ain't no emotion when he pulls the trigger
Brief second of silence, then you see what he do to niggas
Pistols, rifles, grenades, whatever
He's a killin' machine, bought and paid for and clever
And way iller than the last nigga
Smoke a nigga in the club then dance right past niggas
Once in a while, there'll be one who'll stand out
Who's more than psycho, who'll take any man out
With a certain passion for sendin' bullets blastin'
A certain fashion to the way this nigga wax 'em
And this assassin gets mad satisfaction
From puttin' all this worthless scum out of action
A sense of pride in his skill
Looks in the mirror and salutes before he rides for the kill
You got the bag, pop? I got the thing-thing
It's in the sling, here it is, let me let it ring
With the doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Or do it lawn mower style, rrt
You got the bag, pop? I got the thing-thing
It's in the sling, here it is, let me let it ring
I got potatoes and the mufflers in the whole thing
With the fwt, doo-pa, doo-pa, doo-pa, doo-pa, doo-pa, doo-pa
Buckin' at niggas wigs while he's puffin' on cigs
Lay him down, then he bounce out of town to another gig
It ain't nothin', he don't need many friends
Funded different type of weapons, he got plenty of them
If you pass him on the street or see him in his spot
He's always calm, cool, collected, very rarely is he not
Hit man, with ice in his veins
Does the job so precise they up the price with his name
Shadowy figure, never too loose with the lip
Forty-four long in his coat, deuce-deuce on his hip
Baby nine in his boots and his trunk is full
This nigga's on some shit and can't be fucked with, fool
In the grimy world of highly-paid hustlers
First they get goons to muscle ya, then get him to touch ya
You wouldn't wanna get in his way, nor his associates
Or a tombstone bearin' your name will be appropriate
You got the bag, pop? I got the thing-thing
It's in the sling, here it is, let me let it ring
With the doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Or do it lawn mower style, rrt
You got the bag, pop? I got the thing-thing
It's in the sling, here it is, let me let it ring
I got potatoes and the mufflers in the whole thing
With the fwt, doo-pa, doo-pa, doo-pa, doo-pa, doo-pa, doo-pa, doo-pa
