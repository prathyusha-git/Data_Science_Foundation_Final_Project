Down and now I'm flyin'
I'm okay, okay
There's somethin' that I'm dyin'
To say, to say
We don't talk enough, no, no
It's only been an hour or so
My heart's workin' on this shit
That my head wants me to quit
'Cause we don't talk enough, no, no
We don't really talk enough
We don't really talk enough
Maybe that could solve so much
I know we haven't talked
But I think we don't talk enough

But I think we don't talk enough

Put it down to timin'
Behave, behave
Give me points for tryin'
Look my way, my way
We don't talk enough, no, no
It's only been an hour or so
My heart's workin' on this shit
That my head wants me to quit
'Cause we don't talk enough, no, no
We don't really talk enough
We don't really talk enough
Maybe that could solve so much
I know we haven't talked
But I think we don't talk enough
I know we haven't talked
But I think we don't talk enough
I know we haven't talked
