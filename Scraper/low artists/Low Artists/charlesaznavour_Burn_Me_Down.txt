We had a fire and you let it go out
If you planned on leavin', you should've burned me down
I was whole, but I've been fallin' to pieces
Wondering why you had to leave me (Yeah)
Been lookin' for peace in the pieces you left me in
You lied when you said you would love me forever
Then ruin what you and I had
Would never go back to you and I being just friends again
I don't know what else you wanted
I gave you my all 'til my all got exhausted
I lay herе alone in this bed, and I look at this room
And can't help but to feel likе it's haunted by you
What do I do?
When everything in here reminds me of you
Everything smells like your favorite perfume
And the truth is you've never been good with the truth
Isn't that true? I miss what we had
Now you're just someone I knew in the past
I see myself in the way that you act
I hear myself in the way that you laugh
You can't deny that, "I made a mistake"
That's what you said when you called me that day
You're hanging with people I know that you hate
And even your friends have been sayin' you changed
Bumped into your sister, she said you been lost
Been fillin' the void with a couple of shots
Forgive what you did but it can't be forgot
We even talked about tyin' a knot and now
We both act like we don't exist
But deep down we know, it shouldn't end like this
And time will pass while we both resist
But deep down we know, it shouldn't end like, end like this
Deep down we know, it shouldn't end like this
And time will pass while we both resist
But deep down we know, it shouldn't end like (Yeah), end like this
You're not the first person to make me feel like I was homeless
See, you were the hardest to leave
You said that lovin' me felt like a chore
But I know that there's somebody prayin' we'd meet
Of course you don't see all the blessings in front of your face
When your eyes are always on your feed
I hate to think you and I fell apart
So instead, I reframe it as "mission complete"
Go find what you need, couldn't find it in me
Maybe I should say "thank you" for settin' me free
Now there's this gap on your page where our pictures would be
Before you felt the need to delete every moment
I see, you just want me erased
I'm not just someone you were with for a day
Nah, I was someone that went to the ends of the Earth
Just to make sure that you were okay
Now nothin's the same, the same as it was
You shook my faith about fallin' in love
It sucks to know that on the list of the things in your life
There was nothin' you put me above
Damn, not even one, so this is goodbye
Hope you find the love you were hopin' to find
Think maybe the only real version of you that I knew
Is the one I made up in my mind, now
We both act like we don't exist
But deep down we know, it shouldn't end like this
And time will pass while we both resist
Deep down we know, it shouldn't end like (End like)
It shouldn't end like this
And time will pass while we both resist
Deep down we know, it shouldn't end like (End, end)
Deep down we know, it shouldn't end like (End like)
