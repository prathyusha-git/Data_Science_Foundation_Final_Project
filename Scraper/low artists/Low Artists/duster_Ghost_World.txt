Where did you go?
So far from home
You're all alone
Where is your ghost world?
Into nowhere
Fall from under
Are you gone now?

Where did you go?
So long ago
You left alone
You lost your ghost world
Come back home now
On forever
Lost and haunted
♪
Ghost world
Into nowhere
Home forever
In your ghost world
