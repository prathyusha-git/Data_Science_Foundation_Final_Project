It's the Age of Illusion
The Age of Illusion
Everyone is beautiful
Everything is fine
In The Land of Illusion
The water babies speak Japanese
And the faeries drink wine
Everyone is beautiful
Everyone is gay
In the Land of Illusion
We paint our faces with chocolate cake
And everything's okay

Hahahaha!
Let's go
Yo! Let's go
To the Land of Illusion
The Land of Illusion
Everyone is beautiful
Everything is chill
Everyone is famous
Evеryone is happy
Let's pop another bluе pill
Blue pills
I got mad blue pills
Blue pills
I got big black pupils
なぜ私は日本が大好きなのですか?
なぜ私は日本が大好きなのですか?
