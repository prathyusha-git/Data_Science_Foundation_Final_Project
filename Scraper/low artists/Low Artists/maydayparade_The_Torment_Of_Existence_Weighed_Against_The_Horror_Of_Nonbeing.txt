♪
You could call me a fiend
Say I'm as unbalanced as I'll ever be
Wait around for the hook
All while you're desperately clinging to me
You could say that I'm lost
Searching around to find my own soul
Digging under my skin
Wearing your clothes just to know that I'm home
Now it's over and over and right back to me
What's the point if you've got one
Now I'm closer and closer to all that I need
Wait around and you'll see
'Cause we all find love when we fall
We say that it means the whole world but it means nothing at all
♪
Me and all the lost boys
Spinning around in a circus we play
Hit me with it again
Once aint enough now I should be okay
Now it's over and over and right back to me (right back to me)
What's the point if you've got one
Now I'm closer and closer to all that I need
Wait around and you'll see
'Cause we all find love when we fall
We say that it means the whole world but it means nothing at all
I hope I hope you're happy now
I hope I hope you're happy now
Later you'll find out
Later you'll find out
This is a castle and I am the king
There's price that you pay for living this way
Every night on the stage forgetting yourself
For the ones that you love
You don't say what you need you just take what you want
Now it's over and over and right back to me
What's the point if you've got one
Now I'm closer and closer to all that I need
Wait around and you'll see
'Cause we all find love when we fall
We say that it means the whole world but it means nothing at all
