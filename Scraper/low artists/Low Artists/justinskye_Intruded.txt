Last night, you were here
And what we did, it was something special
Boy, I know that you can feel it too
Can you let me know? It's a no brainer
Stop making it hard for me
Loving you comes so damn naturally
And I don't wanna regret taking you back
Seems like we can't resist every time we cross paths
You can't escape my love, so true, yeah
Like I invaded your heart, intruded
You could walk away, but you know that's foolish
'Cause it's like that, yeah, it's like that
Got him coming right back for all this loving
You can't walk away 'cause it's so damn good
I don't care what they say, all my loving goes to you
Yeah, you
Pushing me out of my elemеnt
Can't let it go 'cause it's Heavеn-sent
What if I never get this feeling again?
So I'm going out my way (going out my way)
Tryna make you say (tryna make you say)
That (that)
You making it hard for me
'Cause loving you comes so damn naturally
And I don't wanna regret taking you back
Seems like we can't resist every time we cross paths (oh)
You can't escape my love, so true, yeah
Like I invaded your heart, intruded
You could walk away, but you know that's foolish
'Cause it's like that, yeah, it's like that
Got him coming right back for all this loving
You can't walk away 'cause it's so damn good
I don't care what they say, all my loving goes to you
Yeah, you (you)
It's enough now, babe
You're the only man I'd chase
When you're out there searching
For someone who gets your way
They will never take my place
I can see it in your face
So just let me be yours
Oh, oh, oh
