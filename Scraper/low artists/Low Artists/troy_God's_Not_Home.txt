Hey brother, where you been?
Since the fall, since the sin
Oh, I wanna let you in
But I won't get hurt again
Woah, the angels cry every night
Oh, wondering where you go
God's not home (home, home)
God's not home (home, home)
God's not
Your sweet misery
Must love the company
Of our broken family
That once was heavenly
Woah, the angels cry every night
Oh, while you're reaping what you've sowed
God's not home (home, home)
God's not home (home, home)
God's not home (home, home)
God's not home (home, home)
God's not
(Home, home)
I hope you found what you were looking for
'Cause all the pain I carry in my soul
Is all because you left me here alone
God's not home
God's not home
(Home, home)
God's not home (home, home)
God's not home (home, home)
God's not home (home, home)
God's not home (home, home)
Oh, God's not home
