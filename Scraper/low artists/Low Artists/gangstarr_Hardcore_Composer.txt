Now I got you lookin' stiff, you numbskull
You're at a standstill
Fakin' hard with your rhymes, ain't got no hand skills
So I easily drop you and stop you from rhymin'
Send you home to moms all bruised up and cryin'
Then if you want, you can go call your people
You're gonna need a mob against me 'cause I'm lethal
Not that I'm a violent brother, no, to the contrary
My vocals carry then I bury
MC's in holes they dug for themselves
Couldn't be themselves so they sold theirselves
To a company exec who doesn't have respect
For real rap music so he wants to get
An MC that starts out street to cross over
But not me, 'cause I'm the hardcore composer
I'm harder than the hardest, hardest hard can get
I'm harder than the hardest, hardest hard can get
You ain't a writer, nor a fighter, you're just a biter
I think you need to save all that because in spite of
The reputation that you think you have
The crew already knows that you're really a crab
So I'll grab the mic with haste and send you out of this place
Back to trace my flow, but don't waste your time, bro
It only takes a minute and a second for me to switch
And rearrange real quick
'Cause I can kick plenty styles, rhymes stretch many miles
I'm the authentic, yes, the lyric unloader
The truth exposer, the hardcore composer
♪
I'm harder than the hardest, hardest hard can get
Harder than the— than the— than the— than the— than the
Hardest, hardest hard can get
Are you delirious, curious suckers?
You better act like you've been known
I mack and hold my own with the mic, just to stagger a bragger
Retire a liar, and very easily I'm passin' by ya
'Cause you didn't wanna give the credit
Where it was due, yeah, it was you
Uh-huh, it was you and your crummy corny ass crew
So we shall enforce that you lost
And plus you oughta find another type of life
And yes, another source of income, here's some advice
You can't rap this nice, I broke ya over and over
I told ya I would mold ya, why? (Put it on 'em!)
Because I'm bound to give original sound as your ears pound
Bringin' pleasure and pain and brains start to gain
From musical measures, formin' stanzas, combining
Providing answers to mystical questions
Never typical inventions
Developed by my gifted, unlimited mind
Suckers wanna talk, but they mimic the rhyme
'Cause they're eager to find the secret behind
The way that I stomp all comp just like a Timberland
It's the Guru and Premier, it's them again
Droppin' fly tracks and takin' things over
And never sellin' out, 'cause I'm the hardcore composer
I'm harder than the hardest, hardest hard can get
I'm harder than the hardest, hardest hard can get
Harder than the hardest— than the— than the hardest— than the
Than the hardest, hardest hard can get
I'm harder than the hardest, hardest hard can get
