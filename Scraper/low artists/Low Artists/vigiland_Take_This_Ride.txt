Feels like I've lost my way
I hadn't slept in days
Another drink, another day
Another girl that didn't care
There was no heart to break
But she woke a feeling
Something I never thought I had in me
She's surely too good for me
I keep telling myself
O-oh, don't you dare choke now
She's seen all your worst behavior
But she still don't wanna change her soul
So don't fuck this up now
Look in her eyes, cause this is where your future lies
'Cause this is where your future lies
♪
She hears what's in my head
Those thoughts I've never said
When everyone was scared to feel
Me and her, we kept it real
And they tell me love is dead
But she found a feeling
Something she always feel I had in me
She's surely too good for me
Saying over again
Don't you dare choke now
She's seen all your worst behavior
But she still don't wanna change your soul
So don't fuck this up now
Look in her eyes, cause this is where your future lies
'Cause this is where your future lies
♪
I can't think, where I'd be
What if that day she took a different street
Whenever we take this right
I know this is where my future lies
♪
'Cause this is where your future lies
'Cause this is where your future lies
