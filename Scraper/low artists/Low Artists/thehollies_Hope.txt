When nothin goes your way
Your heart begins to pay
However hard you try the problems seem endless
It's your own bed you make
Not gonna go away
You just break down and cry must be a way out of this
No use feelin sorry for yourself
'Cause you've got something else
Hope
There's gotta be a little bit of you and me
Hope
The only way we're gonna keep our sanity
Hope
There's gotta be a little bit of you and me
Whatever it takes hold on
Keep ridin through the storm
Don't dream of giving up
Don't dream of givin in
Just gotta keep your head the answers all within you
Don't think of losin heart
It's tearin you apart
Just gotta carry on you know you can get through
No use feelin sorry for yourself
'Cause you've got something else
Hope
There's gotta be a little bit of you and me
Hope
The only way we're gonna keep our sanity
Hope
There's gotta be a little bit of you and me
Whatever it takes hold on
Keep ridin through the storm
Well I want what you want that's right
So baby don't give up the fight
Hope
There's gotta be a little bit of you and me
Hope
The only way we're gonna keep our sanity
The only way we're gonna keep our sanity
The only way we're gonna keep our sanity
Hope
There's gotta be a little bit of you and me
Whatever it takes hold on
Keep ridin through the storm
