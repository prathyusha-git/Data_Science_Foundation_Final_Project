Shy for the shadows
♪
Like you've been here before
Can't find a place in this world
You don't belong, moon child
♪
Do you want to be here?
You feel empty just near it
We are the same damn thing
I've been emptied beneath it
♪
Stretch our legs searching below
Chewing through its grip
I can't find the bottom
Just drifting in darkness
But I don't want the shore
♪
'Cause I've been there before
Come to me like a ghost
♪
Whispering, "I don't know"
Come to me like a ghost
Whispering, "I don't know"
