When you wake up screaming
You have to do what you can
To turn a city sidewalk into a desert island
There's so much here to ignore
The world's much uglier than we gave it credit for
I don't need a god to punish me
I'm perfectly capable of doing it on my own
So leave me alone, oh
It's a shame to make the same mistakes
But I'm afraid people don't change
You'll never save the moth from the flame
You made a tape, and play it loud
To try and drown the demons out
Afraid of what will grow in me
A sap to drown the family tree
My body's just a thing to eat
And where they find me
A star is shining
Burning my shadow's shape in the concrete
