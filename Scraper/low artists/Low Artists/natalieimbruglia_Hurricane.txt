It came on like a hurricane
And I don't understand
And it moved me like a slow dance
Still I don't understand
It pushed me like a tailwind
And I don't understand
And it came in through the back door
And I don't understand
Still I don't understand
You're all that I could be
And I'm falling on my knees
Hurricane
You pulled me out of the past
And landed me in today
Hurricane
It picked me like a cherry
And I don't understand
And it killed me with the craving
Still I don't understand
It thrilled me to starvation
And I don't understand
And it stripped me ugly naked
Still I don't understand
No I don't understand
Hurricane
You pulled me out of the past
And landed me in today
Hurricane
You Pulled me out of the past
And walked me into tommorrow
Hurricane
You're all that I could need
And I'm falling on my knees
You're all that I could be
And I'm falling on my knees
Hurricane
You pulled me out of the past
And landed me in today
Hurricane...
