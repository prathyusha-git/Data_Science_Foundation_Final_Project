Finding something to share
Making things feel alive
Feel the falling inside
What you're doing to me
Late and blooming crush
Like a laugh or a scream
Going through my veins
Intoxicating the heart
And harnessing my head
Falling into your touch
Lights get brighter
And lights get harder to see
And disappear
Keeps breaking me off
Breaking me up
Experience is enough
It's in the hang and it's free
You can take what you want
What you're doing to me
Petals falling apart
Tumbling up
♪
And gentle down again
Into your arms
And floating away
Stay a day in your eyes somewhere
Lay here, ain't enough
