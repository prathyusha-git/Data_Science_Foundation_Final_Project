I look to the east and I look to the west
Trying to find a place where there's rest
You know where I go
You know it's the same show
People turning their backs
Not wanting to know
Look there son, you'll find hungry mouths
Saying "Please feed me, well I'm only a child"
All around you'll find fallow ground
But you can't plow a field with a hundred missiles
You know the score
You know it's war
Death and destruction
We gotta change it now
Lord only knows how
To turn it into more
Where have all the rainbows gone?
Where, where, where?
My old pa says he'd seen better days
Where, where, where?
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Speak to me, Lord
Speak to me, Lord
Come on down with Your fiery sword
Rid this place of all this hate
Show Your face before it's too late
You know the score
You know it's war
Death and destruction
Death and destruction
Death and destruction
We gotta change it now
Lord only knows how
