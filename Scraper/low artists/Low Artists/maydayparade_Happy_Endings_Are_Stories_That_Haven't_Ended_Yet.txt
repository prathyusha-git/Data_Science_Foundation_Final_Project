Keep me dizzy, spinning circles around my head
Believe me that it's worth the rush
Til we collide, with heavy hearts and open minds
I'm all by myself, don't leave me hanging
Shakin' like I've caught on fire
We all get stuck in funny ways sometimes
You and every friend of mine
(We'll find a way, to run away, tonight)
♪
You could be my compass
Teach me how to read these broken lines
Hold me like a lover
We'll find a way, to run away, tonight
Tell me when it's over
Promise that you'll always keep me in mind
Burning like a soldier
I'll find my way to you and save the day
