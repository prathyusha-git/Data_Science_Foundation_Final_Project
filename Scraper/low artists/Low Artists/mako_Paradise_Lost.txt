A day late, a dollar short
Feels stuck up in here, here before
Just too good to be true
Daybreak, another morn'
I was meant for something more
That night I left you
I was searching for something I had all along
You don't know it's good 'til it's gone
Oh I made my mistakes
But I tried to stand tall
Like you taught me, you taught me that day
Can we get back to the way it was before
Can we go back to the days before the fall
When we, we had nothing
And nothing was enough
Oh it feels, oh it feels like paradise
Paradise lost
♪
Breathe to me what I saw
Shadows running up against the wall
Oh what can I do?
Met an angel I've never seen before
Whispering a song to my head
That night I left you
I was searching for something I had all along
You don't know it's good 'til it's gone
Oh I made my mistakes
But I tried to stand tall
Like you taught me, you taught me that day
Can we get back to the way it was before
Can we go back to the days before the fall
When we, we had nothing
And nothing was enough
Oh it feels, oh it feels like paradise
