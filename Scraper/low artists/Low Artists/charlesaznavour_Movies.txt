Yeah!
I just heard that my old girl got somebody new and is pregnant
I spent my time just forgettin'
I spent my time on the music and travel the country
Those last couple lines, I've been said it
Last night I took a ride around my old town
Was the last time I felt somethin' for the first time
I took a ride by my old house
'Cause that's where I fell in love for the first time
Thinkin' back, December when I saved every penny that I made
Knew I'd be the greatest, I just gotta find a way
I couldn't even buy food from the place that I work
'Cause the food cost more than the pay that I made
And they told me I would never be shit
Run around in town, "Am I meant to be shit?"
Always had a vision, and they never see shit
Wrote my first line, Witty is the meanest
So there back, get some receipt, people, while I work at the movies
Girls hit me up, now used to look through me
Sayin' I'll change, yeah, you never knew me
But maybe they're right, I just hope I don't lose me, now I'm
Wishin' I could rewind time
Want you back in my room, like I do with a movie
Broke up my heart and my soul many times now
You could see right through me
And when I fell down, you were never around
Now you need me, oh, you need me now? Please
Wishin' I could rewind time
Want you back in my room, like I do with a movie
Wishin' I could rewind time
Want you back in my room, like I do with a movie
Broken my heart and my soul many times now
You could see right through me
And when I fell down, you were never around
Now you need me, oh, you need me now? Please
Wishin' I could rewind time
Want you back in my room, like I do with a movie (movie)
Could see right through me (movie)
Could see right through me (movie)
Could see right through me (movie)
You could see right
I just heard that my other ex-girl is engaged to be married
I think commitment is scary
Maybe that's why it just didn't work out for us
When you show someone your soul, do you ever stop carin'?
Sometimes I wish I could just rewind time
Want to change anything, want to relive moments
Even if I know we wouldn't work out, that's fine
When the first door closes, another one opens
Told me I was hopeless
Now the same people hit me up, I never noticed
Every minute that you spent hatin' on me
Was another minute that I spent workin' on my own shit, had to stay focused
Never could've hoped it, never could've planned it
'Til you feel like you have nothing, you would never understand it
Complements are always backhanded
I see people lookin' for a handout, I could never fuckin' stand it
I just make anthems
And spill out my soul on these pages
Was meant for whenever was random
Used pain as a paint for this painting
I just miss what could've been, but I should just water my grass
And not worry about if the grass will be greener
Damn, it's also ironic
I wrote my first lines while I worked at the theatre, now I'm
Wishin' I could rewind time
Want you back in my room, like I do with a movie
Broke up my heart and my soul so many times now
You could see right through me
And when I fell down, you were never around
Now you need me, oh, you need me now? Please
Wishin' I could rewind time
Want you back in my room, like I do with a movie
Wishin' I could rewind time
Want you back in my room, like I do with a movie
Broken my heart and my soul many times now
You could see right through me
And when I fell down, you were never around
Now you need me, oh, you need me now? Please
Wishin' I could rewind time
Want you back in my room, like I do with a movie
Like I do with a movie (movie)
Could see right through me (movie)
Could see right through me (movie)
Now you could see right through me (movie)
Could see right through me (movie)
Could see right through me (movie)
Could see right through me (movie)
Could see right through me (movie)
No-Now you could see right
