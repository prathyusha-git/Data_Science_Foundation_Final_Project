Never Le Nkemise
I'm indestructible, gangster number one
play now, cry later
the harder they come, the harder they fall
Os, you can't stop me
You can try, but you won't survive
Cause I'm a muthafuckin' ninja
Zef Side Represent, you fuckin' with the best
Ninja the fed kapper
y'all naaiers
clit fucker
Danger/Danger/Danger
Looks like I'm gonna need my
click click
that black glock nine millimeter
Every day's like bulletproof vest time
When you're rollin' through the muthafuckin Zef Side
And now we don't stop at the roadblocks
In the day look around three-sixty degrees
If you bustin' the muthafuckin' doughnut
I'm not even trusting a roadblock
I'll pigs bust caps in the back, of your head
bang, now you're dead
whatcha gonna do, huh?
Maybe go run tell Zuma?
He doesn't give a fuck
That's why we keep it muthafuckin' gangsta
I'm not scared of you
But you muthafuckin' scared of me
Yeah, the Ninja has become the enemy
I'm indestructible, gangster number one
play now, cry later
the harder they come, the harder they fall
Os, you can't stop me
You can try, but you won't survive
Cause I'm a muthafuckin' ninja
If you don't like funerals, don't kick sand in a Ninja's face...
