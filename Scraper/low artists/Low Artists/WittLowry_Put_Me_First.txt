Ooh, baby, yeah, I know it hurts
But right now, I gotta put me first
When you cryin', screamin', yeah, I feel the worst
But right now, I gotta put me first (yeah)
I don't wanna waste our time
I know you gettin' tired of tryin'
I know you gettin' tired of cryin'
We're so good at pretendin' we're fine
If it helps, put the blame on me (on me)
Have your friends come and hate on me (on me)
Fool me once, and I can't trust you
Fool me twice, now I can't trust me, now I can't trust me, and
Never think you'll get me
You gеt drunk and text me
And you say the worst day of your lifе was the day that you met me
Always so petty, say you won't stress me
Wish I could talk, I'd explain if you let me
Think you should know right now that
Just because I carry it well, doesn't make it not heavy
It's heavy, and
Ooh, baby, yeah, I know it hurts
But right now, I gotta put me first
When you cryin', screamin', yeah, I feel the worst
But right now, I gotta put me first
Hmm baby, I know it hurts
But right now, I gotta put me first
And they say, "In love, sometimes it just don't work"
But right now, I gotta put me first
Wanna love you, but I don't love me
I don't wanna stay, but I don't wanna leave
Strung you along, contemplated all week
It doesn't sound better when I put it on beat
Tears in your eyes, no good at goodbye
Think you were in love with the me that you made in your mind
You feel like my love was a lie
Like how could I spend so much time just to leave you behind?
Damn
All your things are on the kitchen counter
You're the type to think your point will matter
More than mine if you're the one to say it louder
I don't think that we should waste another hour
We were milk and honey, now we're sweet and sour
I can't fix it this time with wine and flowers
Time I turn my hurt into a superpower, now
Ooh, baby, yeah, I know it hurts
But right now, I gotta put me first
When you cryin', screamin', yeah, I feel the worst
But right now, I gotta put me first
Hmm baby, I know it hurts
But right now, I gotta put me first
And they say, "In love, sometimes it just don't work"
But right now, I gotta put me first
