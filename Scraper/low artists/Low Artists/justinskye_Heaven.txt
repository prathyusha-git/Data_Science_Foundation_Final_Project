Whoever said I need a halo
To make it out alive
Don't think I'll ever be an angel
I'm floating in the sky, I might have never been this high
Paradise ain't for
When you got someone who lights your dark
You make me feel like heaven all the time
All the time, all the time, all the time, yeah
You make me feel like heaven all the time
All the time, all the time, all the time, yeah
You got me feeling like I'm finally here
But it's no wonder you gon' leave me hurt
'Cause you make me feel like heaven all the time
All the time, all the time, all the time, yeah
I always feel like I'm forsaken
With you, I feel saved, yeah
My heart has always hit the pavement
I've never been a saint, but maybe that'll change
Paradise ain't for (ain't for, no)
When you got someone who lights your dark (lights your dark)
You make me feel like heaven all the time
All the time, all the time, all the time, yeah
You make me feel like heaven all the time
All the time, all the time, all the time, yeah
You got me feeling like I'm finally here
But it's no wonder you gon' leave me hurt
'Cause you make me feel like heaven all the time
All the time, all the time, all the time, yeah
Slowly fading, drifting deeper
Take me home, I've waited for this moment
Don't you know that love still catch you any far?
Don't you know that love shots better in the dark?
I've been slowly fading, mm
You make me feel like heaven all the time
All the time, all the time, all the time, yeah
You make me feel like heaven all the time
All the time, all the time, all the time, yeah
You got me feeling like I'm finally here
But it's no wonder you gon' leave me hurt
'Cause you make me feel like heaven all the time
All the time, all the time, all the time, yeah, yeah
