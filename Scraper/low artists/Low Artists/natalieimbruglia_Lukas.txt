They call him Lukas
Climbing the stairs to talk to you
Coming to tell his stories
Every single one of which is true
Hello Lukas
I'm pleased to meet you, now how do you do?
So they go driving
Out to the river like lovers do
You smell of the summer
Maybe the summer just smells of you
One day I'm gonna be a famous writer
Some book like Love in the Afternoon
It was all Lukas could say
Maybe one day we could run away
Run away
Ooh, I thought you'd never ask
Ooh
Ooh, I thought we'd never last
Ooh
Now here comes Lukas
He'd done everything he wanted to
It was twenty years later
Come back to do what he'd promised to
He'd come back to make her happy
But these things don't always wait for you
And poor Lukas was late
'Cause when he got back she'd been married a day
Gone away
Ooh, I thought you'd never ask
Ooh
Ooh, I thought we'd never last
Ooh
And Lukas would say
For a million lonely people, another lonely day
For a million hearts that open, a million break
And the world's just a fallen angel in my way
High up in heaven you can hear them say
Looking for Lukas, but Lukas was always running away
