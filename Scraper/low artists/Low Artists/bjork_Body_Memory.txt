First snow of Winter
I'm walking hills and valleys
Adore this mystical fog!
This sfucking mist!
These cliffs are just showing off
Then the body memory kicks in
I mime my whole mountains
The moss that I'm made of
I redeem myself
I've been wrestling my fate
Do I accept this ending?
Will I accept my death?
Or struggle claustrophobic?
Fought like a wolverine
With my destiny
Refuse to accept what was meant to be
Then the body memory kicks in, and I trust the unknown
Unfathomable imagination
Surrender to future
Oh, how to capture all this love
And find a pathway for it
Like threading an ocean through a needle
Ribbon through a keyhole
Can't fathom the grasp
I can't grasp the fathom
Then the body memory kicks in
My limbs and tongue take over
Like the ancestors before me
Show me the flow
My sexual DNA
X-rays of my Kama Sutras
Summons different bodies
Compares spines and buttocks
And back of necks
Then my body memory kicks in
It simply takes over
Beastiality
I redeem my body
I wasn't born urban
Toxic doesn't agree with me
A love lured me here
Into a stagnant state
My myths, my customs, ridiculed
Vacuum-packed molecules
Then my body memory kicks in
On this Brooklyn dance floor
Sweating with these rhythms
Rotate this matrix
I'm trapped in legal harness
Kafka-esque, farce like patriarchy
Avoid it to confront it
Then the body memory kicks in
My warrior awakens
My turn to defend
Urban didn't tame me
Then my body memory kicks in
Bosoms and embraces
Oral, anal entrances
Enjoy the satisfaction
If the other is growing
