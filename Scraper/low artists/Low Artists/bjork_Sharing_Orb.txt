Come into my home
Murder my family and leave me alone
Ceaseless hunger ran
Until the sea is silent and deadly quiet
But for an engine
There is another kind of light
As inside you is another resource
Enormous love, she's a sharing orb of water
We all call her our mother, mother
(How do you say love
Out to but seize my blood
Ooh, never enough
Your weapons, your noisy spears in my skull)?
They drive me offward into the deadly lights
There's another kind of light
As inside you is another resource
Enormous love, here's a sharing orb of water
We all call her our mother, mother
