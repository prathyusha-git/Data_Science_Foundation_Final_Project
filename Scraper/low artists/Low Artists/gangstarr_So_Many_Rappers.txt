So many rappers have come and gone
I guess this rap game has really done them wrong
So many rappers tryin' to get their name out
Many got caught up for just havin' their chain out
So many rappers couldn't handle showbiz
While I'm steady rockin', so you know what it is
So many rappers made this their dream
Then quickly, most have disappeared from the scene
So many one-hit wonders, it's like a spin of the wheel
You know I stay consistent and get it in for real
So many rappers wanna rock like this
But they got no stamina and they don't talk like this
Plus I've learned to avoid the traps
I truly love this shit, that's word to MTV Raps
They'll get their little run and have a little fun
Some'll go for popularity, to a little, then to none
Some'll get jacked 'cause they floss too much
Others'll leave the game 'cause they lost too much
Some got bodied before they were totally on
It's like when keepin' it real goes totally wrong
Some get beat by managers, and shiesty execs
Others are brainwashed by their unlikely success
Well, I have proven time and time again
That I'm built to last, so watch me shine again
So many rappers have come and gone
I guess this rap game has really done them wrong
So many rappers tryin' to get their name out
Many got caught up for just havin' their chain out
So many rappers couldn't handle showbiz
While I'm steady rockin', so you know what it is
So many rappers made this their dream
Then quickly, most have disappeared from the scene
Many had major deals, big money and all that
On 106 & Park, in magazines and all that
So many had all that, so how did they fall flat?
That's why my motto has always been to just fall back
And watch the whole circus go by, I'm that guy
As soon as I appear on the scene, nigga, it's shy
So many pranksters with so many gimmicks
Wonder where they're at now, probably somewhere lookin' timid
It's all madness, there's too many to count
Everybody and their mom wanna rap, no doubt
Many come out with a bang, and their own new slang
Then end up back in the hood without a goddamn thing
Some make noise, they hit the top of the charts
Still, the shit that I kick will be stoppin' they hearts
So many rappers in search of fame
And most'll be lucky if we remember their names
