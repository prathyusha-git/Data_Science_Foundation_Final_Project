I hate tellin' good people bad news
I hate, I hate
I hate tellin' good people bad news
Word to God, if Big and 'Pac was still here
Some of these weirdos wouldn't act so cavalier
We all know that the game has changed
It's crazy out here, rap's got a bad name
Think about it, what if bling never happened?
And the true artists were gettin' rich from rappin'
Word to God, some should give
Let's delete the politics so real Hip-Hop can live
Beef is what's up now
Careers are gettin' shut down
The media wants something meaty
People are fuckin' greedy
Music and culture is like a foreign language
You be better off stagin' a fake beef in Spanglish
Compadre, can you handle the whole weight?
¡Ay, Dios míos!, watch'em swallow your whole plate
You used to support your fam' off of this
Now you can't even buy spam off of this
And I don't deal with swine, I ain't Dr. Phil
I'm truly up in here, your mind
Nowadays it's like everybody's losin' it
Instead of them preservin' this gift, they're all abusin' it
It's not drama, they want us reachin' for the llamas
Causin' hysteria, the new Hip-Hop criteria
And they forgot about the blood, sweat and tears
Now we see the results of all the blunts, chicks and beers
Word to God, if Big and 'Pac was still here
Some of these weirdos wouldn't act so cavalier
We all know that the game has changed
It's crazy out here, rap's got a bad name
Think about it, what if bling never happened?
And the true artists were gettin' rich from rappin'
Word to God, some should give
Let's delete the politics so real hip-hop can live
I hate tellin' good people bad news
I hate tellin' good people bad news
I hate tellin' good people bad news
