You hit me on the late night
I was coming through to get my head right
I can't even lie I had a drink or two
Anything I can to get my mind off you
Twisted fantasies in my head
And I don't wanna talk I wanna show you instead
You hit me right on time
Wonder where you at when you're not on my mind (hey)
What happened to the vibing, boy, you killed it
Another fuckboy off the list, as I predicted
How come shit could never be consistent?
Try to find another me, won't get it
What happened to the vibing, boy, you killed it
If you wanna come down, my way
Let me remind you, replay
If you just trust me, you'll stay
If you nuh trust me, no way
Give it to you right at the top, I don't wait
If you want something that you can't say
If you nuh trust me, won't wait
If you can't trust me, won't stay
Smoke just a little bit, vibe just a little bit
Drink just a little bit and I'll get rid of it all (hey)
Get rid of it all, baby
We smoke just a little bit, fight just a little bit
Drink just a little bit, can we get rid of it all
Get rid of it all, baby
And I ain't tryna play innocent
When you look into my eyes like that
And you're looking at the time I left
You're something, you know what, baby
Tryna tell myself
It's a little burnt out, I guess
But I'm constantly trying, oh, no
If you wanna come down, my way
Let me remind you, replay
If you just trust me, you'll stay
If you nuh trust me, no way
Give it to you right at the top, I don't wait
If you want something that you can't say
If you nuh trust me, won't wait
If you can't trust me, won't stay
(Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up)
Yeah-yeah
All dem other girls that I love got my mind really fucked up
I got a little fear that I'm gonna drown if I love you too much
If I love you too much
I cannot take it to the internet, that shit be looking too forced
It be looking too forced
Now you jumping into conclusion
Telling me I do not love you enough, woah, woah, woah, woah
I know I got a lot of issues, baby (issues, baby)
It doesn't mean I do not love you, baby (love you, baby)
Reset my brain when you touch me, baby, woah, woah
Cutie dress, who you goin' to see?
I get insecure when you're looking like this
Come baby girl, let me fuck you in that dress
You can never ever go scot-free, ooh, I
I understand everything Justine
I know you are trying to adjust me
After this promise, you will never cross me
Don't fuck with my trust
If you wanna come down, my way (my way)
Let me remind you, replay (replay)
If you just trust me, you'll stay (you'll stay)
If you nuh trust me, no way (no way)
Give it to you right at the top, I don't wait (oh, yeah, oh-oh, oh-oh)
If you want something that you can't say (oh, yeah, oh-oh, oh-oh)
If you nuh trust me, won't wait (oh, yeah)
If you can't trust me, won't stay
