Love comes but once in a while
Now that you're here I'm beginning to smile
Why do they want us to walk when we can fly
Our love is burning inside
Why is it something that we have to hide
Why do they want us to walk when we can fly
We'll always feel the same
If they break us up we'll only have ourselves to blame
But we know they're playing games
What affairs to show we can make it go
If they only had wings
then they'd be sharing in all of our things
Why do they want to walk when they can fly
What affairs to show we can make it go
Fly fly fly fly
