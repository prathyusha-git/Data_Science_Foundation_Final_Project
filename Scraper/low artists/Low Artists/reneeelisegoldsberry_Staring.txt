You walked in the room and you arrested me
Ain't no man got the best of me in so long
Try-na keep steady but you got me shook
Wasn't ready for the way you look
I'm so gone
Need something to hold on
You are the headlights and I'm the deer
About to get hit but I'm standing here
Glad I got eyes cuz I get to see
This man in front of me, you got me
Staring
You got me swearing
That I ain't never gonna leave
All I wanna do
Is spend my life standing here staring at you
Staring
You got me swearing
That I ain't never gonna stray
Baby everyday
I'm a be here cuz I can't look away
Mercy, mercy me, your physiology
I got chills over all of me
It's insane
Bet you hear my heart racing from over there
Catch me watching you
I don't care
No shame
Bless me with your name
You are the headlights and I'm the deer
About to get hit but I'm standing here
Glad I got eyes cuz I get to see
This man in front of me, You got me
Staring
You got me swearing
That I ain't never gonna leave
All I wanna do
Is spend my life standing here staring at you
Staring
You got me swearing
That I ain't never gonna stray
Baby everyday
I'm a be here cuz I can't look away
Call me a doctor cuz I'm 'bout to faint
Feel like I'm drunk or I'm sniffing paint
Six feet, dark meat, crispy skin and all
Somebody check my cholesterol
It's just unlawful the way you look
I'll lock you up for that breath you took
From the F to the I to the N to the E
Look what God made for me
You got me
Staring
You got me swearing
That I ain't never gonna leave
All I wanna do
Is spend my life standing here staring at you
Staring
You got me swearing
That I ain't never gonna stray
Baby everyday
I'm a be here cuz I can't look away
