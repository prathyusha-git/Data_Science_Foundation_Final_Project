I remember the first time that I felt this weight on me
Yeah, I was only 15
And just like the first time in that teenage misery
Yeah, I wish things were as easy
But I might save the day
Yeah, I might change the world
Things will be fine
Things will be fine
The sooner you trust someone, the better you will feel
So please, put your trust in me
As soon as you do, I'll say when I've made up my mind
But you know things will be fine
'Cause I might save the day
Yeah, I might change the world
You could be the one
To drag me out this hole
Yeah, I might save the day
Yeah, I might change the world
But I need you the most
Yeah, I need you to hold
Things will be fine
Things will be fine
Things will be fine
Things will be fine
Things will be fine
Things will be fine
I tried to forget that I was only your lover
