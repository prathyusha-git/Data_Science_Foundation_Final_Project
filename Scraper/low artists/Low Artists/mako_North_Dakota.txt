I think that I'd love North Dakota
I saw it once inside a magazine
Get this chip up off of my shoulder
Settle down somewhere the grass is green
'Cause California dreams has too many sleepless nights
I wanna feel the earth beneath my feet
Been searching for relief from all these city lights
I just need a place to let me be
Let me be free
Let me be whole again
Let me be me
Let me take hold again
Let me be free
Let me be free
I took a ride in New York City
But, it was too much cocaine and the girls ain't cheap
I had to get out before it killed me
Running good ain't running at that speed
'Cause California dreams has too many sleepless nights
I wanna feel the earth beneath my feet
Been searching for relief from all these city lights
I just need a place to let me be
Let me be free
Let me be whole again
Let me be me
Let me take hold again
Let me be free
Let me be free
