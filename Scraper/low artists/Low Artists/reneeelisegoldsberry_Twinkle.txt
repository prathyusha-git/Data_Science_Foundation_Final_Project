Twinkle, twinkle, little black girl star
Dark and lovely shining bright and far
Wouldn't dare call you fair, cause you're too fine
Nothing better than your front, but your behind
Show me, show me, show me your light
Bitsy, bitsy, baby on your climb
When the rain comes down, don't change your mind
You are destined to get to the tip top
Nothing scareder than the sun, than a raindrop
So show me, show me, show me your life
I wanna tell them
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Hey, little star
Ooh, ooh, ooh
(You will buy)
Every diamond ring can make the mocking bird sing
So don't hush about anything
(When you cry)
The Lord always hears you so keep singing to light
(Wear your crown)
On top of the highest hill
Don't tumble like Jack Jill
Right in the water you spill
(Round and round)
Let the wheels of your mind
Claim every nursery rhyme
It's time
Shine, shine, shine
Little star
If you're happy, baby, just say so
Clap your hands and let the whole world know
Don't you dare hold your power and fight it
God gave you joy and don't be hiding
Show me, show me, show me your life
Show me, show me, show me your life
Show me, show me, show me your life
