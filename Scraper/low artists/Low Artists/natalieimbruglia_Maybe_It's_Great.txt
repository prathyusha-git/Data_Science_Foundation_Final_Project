I can't stop thinking it's not right
I haven't got the fight
We don't see eye-to-eye
And I guess I bought into the lies
And you're not here tonight
I'm sick of asking why
Was it ever happy ever?
After all the shit that we've been through
Nothing new
Maybe it's great
When you've got something to lose
Maybe it's great
That the lies, they told the truth
Maybe it's great
When there's nothing left but you
What to do
I remember
Do you remember?
Come on, come on, come on
We can get this right
And I guess we bought into the lies
I haven't got the fight
We don't see eye-to-eye
Maybe it's great
When you've got something to lose
Maybe it's great
That the lies, they told the truth
'Cause I believe in miracles
But face-to-face the two of us don't have a clue
And I been wondering if I can ever top the feeling
That I have with you
Maybe it's great
That there's nothing left but you
What to do
Someone tell me what to do
Someone tell me what to do
Someone tell me what to do
Maybe it's great
When you've got something to lose
Maybe it's great
That the lies, they told the truth
'Cause I believe in miracles
But face-to-face the two of us don't have a clue
And I been wondering if I can ever top the feeling
That I have with you
Maybe it's great
When you've got something to lose
Maybe it's great
When there's nothing left but you
Just you
