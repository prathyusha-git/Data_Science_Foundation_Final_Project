Yeah, I know I got scuffles ahead of me
When I'm speaking my mind, it's unsettling
I know liberal feelings is delicate
Fly the plane when you feed 'em they medicine
Got the doctors prescribing us ketamine
Because it's more than these shadows I'm wrestling
Drip my bitch in Dior, she decadent
Work so much, you think Peggy was Mexican
They still thinking that Peggy a joke
Got procedures in place for the heckling
When they wanna sneak diss they say veteran
I'm like Kelly, Beyoncé, Michelle
Say my name or I can't really tell
Niggas rap like they castin' a spell
Niggas vague, my presence is felt
I'm direct they go everywhere else
I been ratchet since Kenan and Kel
Don't know who you are, be someone else
Don't just copy me, bitch, be yourself
When you got it, they hate you or steal
They gon' laugh every time that you rap
'Til them raps start paying they bills, yeah
Uh, 45 on the hip, ready, pronto
Two cups, champagne and a rhino
Weapons registered, ready to unload
We don't use it, we beat him like Harpo
All my bitches in love with the co-co
Got my side bitch sniffing Jack Harlow, uh
All my bad hoes bringin' that
Work home straight to my gamer chair
5'9' knocking down hoes as tall
As Angel Reese, I don't care
Hoe, don't read my sign, I know I ain't shit
Let's not even go there
Heard you fucking my bitch
I fucked yours too, let's keep that shit square
Ayy, ball on me, ayy, fall on me
Ayy, put it all on me, babe, what?
What? What? What?
What? What? What?
