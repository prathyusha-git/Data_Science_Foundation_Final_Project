Close your eyes,
Listen closely:
All that you learnt,
Try to forget it.
(Sweet intuition)
Bunk logic, bunk logic,
(Sweet intuition)
Grow up to instinct,
(Sweet intuition)
And sweet intuition.
(Sweet intuition)
What makes you tick,
Try to remember her.
All that you learnt,
Try to forget it.
(Sweet intuition)
Believe in, believe in,
(Sweet intuition)
Believe in instinct,
(Sweet intuition)
And sweet intuition.
(Sweet intuition)
Sweet intuition,
Sweet intuition,
Sweet intuition,
Sweet intuition.
And inside,
We're all still wet,
Yearning and longing.
Repeat after me:
(Sweet intuition)
Bunk logic, bunk logic,
(Sweet intuition)
Grow up to instinct,
(Sweet intuition)
And sweet intuition,
(Sweet intuition)
Sweet intuition, honey.
(Sweet intuition)
Sweet intuition,
(Sweet, sweet intuition)
Sweet, sweet inuition honey,
(Sweet)
Sweet...
Sweet intuition,
Sweet intuition.
