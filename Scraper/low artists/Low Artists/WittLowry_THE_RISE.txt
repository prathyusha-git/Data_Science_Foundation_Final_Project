It's a goddamn shame (woo)
You been lookin' for change, but you never wanna goddamn change (nah)
Stupid motherfucker, better stay in your goddamn lane (woah)
I make art, you make memes, bitch, we are not the same
We are not the same, I'm just sayin'
I got my foot on they neck
'Til every one of them pay me respect
Buyin' designer and diamonds to flex
I called up my mom and I paid off her debt
Didn't do that just for likes on the 'net
Remember when we couldn't pay for the rent?
Not bad for some guy who complains 'bout his ex
Turned on all my old shit, to hear all the new shit
You're gonna do next, haha
1A0 wit
I diss my own blood, so don't think I won't diss
They told me God gave me a gift
Now how many writers you got? I been makin' a list
You shoot from the hip, I shoot for the sky
I'm shootin' for being the greatest alive
Dan said they aren't ready for POM5
Been workin' all night, I can sleep when I die
I'd rather cut my ties before I waste my time
You don't think about the boy, then why you hittin' my line?
Stick around long enough and watch the lames switch sides
Just hit my stride, yeah, I'm on my rise
I tried to please them all, instead I lost my mind
You wanna see me fall? Well bitch, get in line
Doesn't mean you found gold, just because that shit shine
Just hit my stride, yeah, I'm on my rise
This year red is all I see
Just me, myself and my team
You can rap over Witt type beats
But you can never be me
Three rappers in your top three
They don't profit off all those streams
'Cause some old guy up in an office owns the MP-3
We need less sheep, we need more thought
Stuck stayin' "indie," 'cause I can't be bought
One on the charts when you said that I flopped
I look at my plaque and I smile a lot
The bottom is lonely and so is the top
Find you a girl with a plan, not a plot
A fake will jump ship, then they'll say I fell off
Then crawl back when they're feelin' empty and lost
I'm thankful for every fan that I got
They got you a playlist to sweeten the pot
You spend your advance on a chain and a watch
I spend my own money on shit that I got, hehe
I keep it real, feel like the only one
The game's been off balance, all you rappers are Napoleon
I'd rather cut my ties before I waste my time
You don't think about the boy, then why you hittin' my line?
Stick around long enough and watch the lames switch sides
Just hit my stride, yeah, I'm on my rise
I tried to please them all, instead I lost my mind
You wanna see me fall? Well bitch, get in line
Doesn't mean you found gold, just because that shit shine
Just hit my stride, yeah, I'm on my rise
You sing that shit like you wrote it
You sing that shit like you own it
You even know you won't last
You're only here for the moment
Just know the chamber is loaded
Give me a time and a motive
I've got some friends in high places
You know, your label, they own it
I treat my room like a cocoon, I should get out more
They wanted honest music, but instead they fuckin' found yours
It's sad you're only known for stupid shit that you get clout for
Never needed your help, you see I did this shit without yours (hehe)
Fire
