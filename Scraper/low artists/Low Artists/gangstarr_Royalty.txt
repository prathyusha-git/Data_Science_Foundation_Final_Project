A Gang Starr has got to be the sure shot
And it's like that
A Gang Starr has got to be the sure shot
And it's like that
A Gang Starr has got to be the sure shot
And it's like that
A Gang Starr represent
One of the meanest and the cleanest
And still, I'm kind of fiendish when I'm at this
Been doin' this for eons, peons best to catch this
Vision of excellence, precise rappin' ability
'Bout to make some dead presidents mackin' a million, G
The money, though it's got people acting funny, yo
As soon as some niggas get some light, they be like dummies, yo
Products and puppets and pawns, gettin' played out
When authentic niggas step up respect be laid out
Major effect to your sector, I'm the corrector
Live and direct, wavin' my mic like a scepter
Supreme exalted, universal leader
Descendant of the kings and queens, the overseer
The overlord, cream of the crop, crème de la crème
Spent years building with cats in the streets so they my men
Again Gang Starr has done it
Remember too much jewels back in the days? You'd have to run it
Check it, the ground be hot under our feet
So we be listenin' to beats to keep the cypher complete
Whether you kids be holdin' on the block all day
Or you be puffin' lye out in the back hallway
Or whether you be in school, or in the library
Wherever you are, baby paw, realize that your essence
Is divine, son, and let it shine, son, as we refine, son
Ayo, this shit'll blow your mind, son – we're royalty
Whatever I do
I won't accept nothin' less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do
I have to stand out from all the rest
Whatever I do, wherever I go
I won't accept nothin' less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do
I just wanna stand out from all the rest
And all the girls, they want to spoil me
My honey anoints me with oils, G
After work, she greets me, and treats me like royalty
Works with me, giving herself, by my side
She don't sweat me for loot, my fame, or my ride
A lot of ladies out there be looking lovely
But they don't got no control of their life – inside, they're ugly
Word to Bugsy, and to Red Alert
Sway and Tech, and Funkmaster Flex to make your head jerk
Chicks go berserk when they see us in the spot
K-Ci, JoJo, and Preemo–creepin' to the top
And to the sweethearts out there breakin' hearts
While we're taking part of this hip-hop art
Listen, yo – the best way, it ain't always the fast way
And yes, the best way, it ain't always to act nasty
I'll open up the door always, before you pass me
Baby doll, because you're royalty
Whatever I do, wherever I go
I won't accept nothin' less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do
I have to stand out from all the rest
Whatever I do, wherever I go
I won't accept nothin' less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do
I just wanna stand out from all the rest
Gang Starr has got to be the sure shot
And it's like that
A Gang Starr has got to be the sure shot
And it's like that
A Gang Starr has got to be the sure shot
And it's like that
A Gang Starr has got to be the sure shot
And it's like that
Ohhh yay oh yeah ohh
Whatever I do I only want the best
Somebody out there wants the best
Don't you settle for less
Yeah, yeah
Told you to do real
