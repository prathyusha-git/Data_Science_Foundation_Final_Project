Bitch, I'm Ben Carson
You know a nigga hood rich
I got my degrees with no fees
On some goon shit
Came up from the streets in the D
On some coon shit
Foodstamps, pool sticks
Bitch I live in Maryland
Gifted with the hands
Give you D's like you failing
Kick a nigga ass if he mess
With my patience
Fuck a blue state
Got these red nominations
Split you in half like a twin bitch
I'm cooning for cash
I'm a dog, I will swarm on that ass
Good with the money and math
I'll Chuck up the cheese
You tokens will never get past
