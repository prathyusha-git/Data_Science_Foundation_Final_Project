It's King Equality with lines cocked back to add on
Word to everything, that's what I put that on
Yo, I sat on the sidelines, watched you foolish men
Fake hooligans, now it's time for us to duel again
Yeah, it's me, takin' you savages to school again
I rule again, women are preparin' my food again
I'm like the imperial bandit, stackin' my loot again
Ancient warrior, street fighter, contemporary
Intelligent comrade, enemies I've been sent to bury
You see me at seminars, clubs and bars
I own this shit, rollin' with gangsters, thugs with scars
You see me from a distance, tryin' to analyze the righteous
Caught a scandal and a crisis from this vandalous psychic
Government name Keith Elam, put in work per diem
Still a fly-ass nigga, a magnetic human being
B-A-L-D-head to the Slick, I'm wettin' 'em quick
You are now rockin' with the best
Gang Starr
The God Universal Ruler Universal
I came to give you exactly what you asked for here
You are now rockin' with the best
Gang Starr
The God Universal Ruler Universal
Doin' a whole lot up in these streets
Well, it's the Justice Equality Ruler Universal
Carefree, sun see, light speed react nuclear thermal
Three-hundred-sixty degrees, we comin' full circle
Open the portal, now you witness God's immortal verbals
Shinin' light infinitely like the cosmosis
Modern science would define this rhyme as osmosis
Go through your faction or sect, we're laser beam focused
You see, if rap was a crime, we'd be on Wanted posters
Keith, we kinda like the team that killed the White Lotus
My feet firm in the ground and Guru on my shoulders
Deep concentration is the formulation at begin
Poison pen, maestro chop the violin
I try to stop but my mind keep firin'
Try to advance, you hear them ambulance sirens
You ain't get it? Here's the summation
Nigga, fuck what you heard, it's Gang Starr Foundation
You are now rockin' with the best
Gang Starr
The God Universal Ruler Universal
I came to give you exactly what you asked for here
You are now rockin' with the best
Gang Starr
The God Universal Ruler Universal
Doin' a whole lot up in these streets
