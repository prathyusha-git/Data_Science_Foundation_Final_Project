You bought yourself a little freedom
Yeah I know you saved up, yeah you saved up
So make it last
You got some brand new sneakers
Little darling lace up, darling lace up
And make it fast
They'll try to make you talk
Don't give them nothing
You're up against the wall
Waiting for judgement
Open your prison door
Nobody's watching
You only get one shot
You better run for your life

You better run for your life

Is it everything you dream of?
Now that you've got your eyes up, got your eyes up
Off the ground
You hear me yelling at your treason [?]
Little rebel rise up, go and rise up
And make us proud
They'll feed you sense and doubt
Play on your conscience
But you'd rather risk it all
Fighting for justice
Here's what you waited for
Everyone's watching
You only get one shot
You better run for your life
