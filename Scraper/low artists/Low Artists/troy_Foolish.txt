Feeling lonely, but that's alright
At least that's what I tell myself to get me through the night
I know I'm lost, but that's okay
Maybe I don't wanna be found anyway
I think about you every now and then
Wonder if you miss me or laugh about me to your friends
They said we were pretty good together
But we're they wrong
♪
I couldn't fall asleep tonight because of you
And I know it isn't right to call and say I broke your heart in two
I know that you loved me more than you showed
But I was foolish to think that I'd stop loving you
Soon as I let you go
I go out like everything's fine
Maybe even treat myself to something finer than wine
But no one leads me home to bed like you do
I'm craving you
I couldn't fall asleep tonight because of you
Oh and I, know it isn't right to call and say I broke your heart in two
I know that you loved me more than you showed
But I was foolish to think that I'd stop loving you
Soon as I let you go
But I'm not over you
It's true
I'm not over you
I couldn't fall asleep tonight
I couldn't fall asleep tonight because of you
And I know it isn't right to call and say I broke your heart in two
I know that you loved me more than you showed
But I was foolish to think that I'd stop loving you
Soon as I let you go
