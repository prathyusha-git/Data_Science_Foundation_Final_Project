I've named this one JPEG
Uh, no debit, I want credit
These dudes actors, straight jackers
Never learned to be a rapper
Kill masters, ice white like Casper
JPEG presentation
All these pussy niggas passive
Garcon, Garcon, Garcon, Garcon
Does this ski mask make me look fat?
♪
And I'm fresh out the bag, on my life
Nigga, go on bust a sag, on my life
My homie told me, "Kick that Super Saiyan long as it can sell"
25 packs on the real
I feel like another spoke on the wheel
Two kills, one shot
The crack rock hit your face like Botox
I won't stop you on 4chan
Bitch, I got the fo' cocked
And when I pull it you gonna call cops, hoe stop
I'm on the coast now
Niggas playing with the Peg, no sound
Rappers coming at me smoking on that PCP
Fuck around and end up on Smack DVD
I wonder if my momma ever seen me cheese
Nigga, I been wild ever since I passed my CDCs
25 cities in a row
I'm switching up the coast
Give my ego some hope, I tell 'em
No debit, I want credit
These dudes actors, straight jackers
Never learned to be a rapper
I kill masters, bringing math to disasters
Toe-tagging, ice white like Casper
Flow tragic, you should pick another tactic
I'm so ratchet, all these pussy niggas passive
I'm too graphic, more blunt ashes
Nigga, fuck your fabric, you average
♪
All the pain and suffering was temporary
Nowadays I swear that they was never ready
For me coming from nothing to get it varied
Determined to prove that I would be legendary (sheesh)
I only got one life to live, yeah
But I'm gonna do whatever's necessary
Until I'm dead and buried
Up in the cemetery
All that other shit is secondary to me
I put that on my life, that's word to my momma
That's why I grind and I serve for them commas
Because that's what it's like being birthed from the bottom, ayy
I know you heard that I'm poppin', ayy
Came from the dirt now I got it, ooh
No way on Earth that I'm stopping, no
Quit trying to ride on my wave
Like I'ma surf in the tropics
No debit, I want credit
These dudes actors, straight jackers
Never learned to be a rapper
I kill masters, bringing math to disasters
Toe-tagging, ice white like Casper
Flow tragic, you should pick another tactic
I'm so ratchet, all these pussy niggas passive
I'm too graphic, more blunt ashes
Nigga, fuck your fabric, you average
Fuck your fabric, you average
Fuck all your fabric, you average
All of these niggas is passive
They pussy, they better pick tactics
Learn to be rappers
I swear these dudes is some actors
Pussies is passive
Niggas is passive
