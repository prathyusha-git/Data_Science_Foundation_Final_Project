Like a virus needs a body
As soft tissue feeds on blood
Someday I'll find you
The urge is here, ooh
♪
Like a mushroom on a tree trunk
As the protein transmutates
I knock on your skin
And I am in, ooh
♪
The perfect match, you and me
I enter, contagious
You open up, saying welcome
Like a flame that seeks explosives
As gun powder needs a war
I feast inside you
My host is you, ooh
♪
The perfect match, you and I
You fail to resist
My crystalline charm
Like a virus, patient hunter
I'm waiting for you
I'm starving for you
♪
My sweet adversary
My sweet adversary
♪
My sweet adversary
