Gotta get back
Gotta figure out a way
I'm losing my senses to you
Where did it go? The bluebird I should follow back home
But where is home?
Guess it won't amount to much
♪
Won't be long before I crush
I'll stand in line
Don't believe a thing they say today
Seems we all get lost amongst
Pigeons and the crumbs
♪
All alone but I'm in a crowded room
I'm sinking in the quicksand tonight
You pick me up and I shine across the sky
Till morning then you color me in
Guess it won't amount to much
♪
Seems to me I've lost my touch
I'm back in line
Don't believe a thing they say today
Turn around and walk away
♪
Everything will go your way
I pray
Seems we all get lost amongst
Pigeons and the crumbs
♪
Gotta get it in time
♪
Gotta get it last time
♪
Don't believe a thing they say today
Turn around and walk away
♪
Everything will go your way
I pray
Seems we all get lost amongst
Pigeons and the crumbs
But don't believe a thing they say today
Turn around and walk away
♪
Everything will go your way
I pray
Seems we all get lost amongst
Pigeons and the crumbs
