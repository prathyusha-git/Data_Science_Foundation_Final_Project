Pullin' up new G wagon
Look at us, ooh, we braggin'

And I ain't gon' let up
Know these bitches mad at me soon as they get up
Know your man lookin' at my page when he get up
Know the cash, hit the bank when the phone lit up
All action, no gas
Big talk, big facts

Pop that pussy, and shake that ass
Have a good time, I'ma throw this cash
Pop that, I'ma shake that ass
And I'ma make it right back, yuh
If you're mad, let me know

Would have said it with your chest if you meant it
And your nigga left, but you still won't admit it

All action, no gas
Big talk, big facts
