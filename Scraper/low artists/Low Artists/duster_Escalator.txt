Time elapsed in my grave
Because nothing connects
Like the foam on a wave
Insignificant hex
Jacket draped on a chair
Are you waiting to leave?
Are you going nowhere
Or are you looking for me?
Do you
Imagine what your heart seeks?
Were you born on the down
Like us mysterious freaks?
Lost count
How many days in a row?
Lost count
How many days in a row?
