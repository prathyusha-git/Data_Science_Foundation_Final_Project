Im a smart girl. But I do stupid stuff sometimes.
In a dark world, Where truth's the only light.
Don't feed me sugercoated, Words I don't want that no I want actions.
If you want me back then take me back then.
Its not about the picture, Its about the stupid Sh*t you did that got me thinking back to life then and back then.
Feeling so high school right now, more alcholic water in the pool right now.
I'm not tryna' be cool right now, I'm tryna' be with you like fool right now.
If real life I'm a smart girl. But I do stupid stuff sometimes.
I deserve truth. I'm real its only right.
Don't feed me sugercoated.
Facts about this world like I'm not in it.
Lies about how hard it is been winning.
Its not about the ending, It's about the way you living if your hearing this then chances are you living.
