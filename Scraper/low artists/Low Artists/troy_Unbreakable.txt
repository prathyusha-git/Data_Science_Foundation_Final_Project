I reminisce about the good times
That haven't happened yet
I think of all the places I would go if I could just afford it
And hey, I'm not gonna take it
When they say I won't make it
Cause I'll make it
As the world gets warmer, people stay cold
They're just cannon fodder, chipping away at their souls
If you think I'm losing the fight
I'll get back up
Cause I'm unbreakable
I don't get hurt like I used to
Cause now I finally understand
If I kept every promise I made to myself
I'd be a different man
But hey, I'm not gonna take it
When they say I won't make it
I'll make it
As the world gets warmer, people stay cold
They're just cannon fodder, chipping away, chipping away
If you think I'm losing the fight
I'll get back up
Cause I'm unbreakable
Unbreakable
I don't need the pain and sorrow
I won't give up on tomorrow
As the world gets warmer, people stay cold
They can say I'm wrong
But I'm unbreakable
Unbreakable
Unbreakable
Unbreakable
Unbreakable
Unbreakable
Unbreakable
