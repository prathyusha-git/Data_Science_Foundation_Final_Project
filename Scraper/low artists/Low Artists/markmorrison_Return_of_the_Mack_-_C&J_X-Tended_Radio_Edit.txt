Ooh, come on, ooh yeah, well, I tried to tell you so
(Yes, I did)
But I guess you didn't know, as the saddest story goes
Baby, now I got the flow? cause I knew it from the start
Baby, when you broke my heart that I had to come again
And show you that I'm with
You lied to me
All those times I said that I loved you
You lied to me
Yes, I tried, yes, I tried
You lied to me
Even though you know I'd die for you
You lied to me
Yes, I cried, yes, I cried
Return of the Mack
It is return of the Mack
Come on, return of the Mack
Oh, my God, you know that I'll be back
Here I am
Return of the Mack
Once again, return of the Mack
Top of the world, return of the Mack
Watch my flow, you know that I'll be back
Here I go
So, I'm back up in the game, running things like half my swing
Lettin' all the people know that I'm back to run the show
'Cause what you did you know was wrong
And all the nasty things you've done
So baby, listen carefully while I sing my comeback song
You lied to me
Cause she said she'd never turn on me
You lied to me
But you did, but you did
You lied to me
All this pain you said I'd never feel
You lied to me
But I do, but I do, do, do
Return of the Mack
It is return of the Mack
Hold on, return of the Mack
Don't you know, you know that I'll be back
(Here I go)
Return of the Mack
Oh, little girl
Return of the Mack
Once more, girl
Return of the Mack
Up and down
You know that
I'll be back round and round
Ahh, Mark
Stop worrying about your big break
You lied to me
Cause he said she'd never turn on me
You lied to me
But you did, but you did
You lied to me
All this pain you said I'd never feel
You lied to me
But I do, but I do, do, do
Return of the Mack
It is
Return of the Mack
Come on
Return of the Mack
Oh, my God
You know that I'll be back
Here I am
Return of the Mack
Once again
Return of the Mack
Top of the world
Return of the Mack
Watch my flow
You know that I'll be back
Don't you know
Return of the Mack
