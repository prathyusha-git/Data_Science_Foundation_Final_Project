I know you haven't gone away
But I'm counting down the days
'Til you and I won't see each other
I'll never be the same
So when I wish upon a star
So you stay inside my heart
And live inside my memory
To wonder very far
And I hope you know that...
No matter where you go
You'll never be alone
Please know that
Every day I'll think of you
No matter where you are
We'll never be apart
Just know that
Every day I'll think of you
Please know that
Every day I think about you
I should've found a better way
To not drive myself insane
But the thought of every part of you
Is worth the brutal pain
But for now I'll hold your hand
And celebrate the things I can
I'll pull you close 'cause you're my home
And I'll never leave again
And I hope you know that...
No matter where you go
You'll never be alone
Please know that
Every day I'll think of you
No matter where you are
We'll never be apart
Just know that
Every day I'll think of you
Please know that
Every day I think about you
