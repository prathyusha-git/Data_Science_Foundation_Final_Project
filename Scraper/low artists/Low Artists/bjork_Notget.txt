Once you fell out of love
Our love couldn't carry you
And I didn't even notice
For our love kept me safe from death
♪
You doubted the lights
And the shelter it can give
For in love, we are immortal
Eternal, and safe from death
If I regret us
I'm denying my soul to grow
Don't remove my pain
It is my chance to heal
We carry the same wound
But have different cures
Similar injuries, but opposite remedies
♪
After our love ended
Your arms don't carry me
Without love, I feel the abyss
Understand your fear of death
I will not forget
This Notget
Will you not regret
Having love let go?
After our love ended
Your spirit entered me
Now we are the guardians
We'll keep her safe from death
