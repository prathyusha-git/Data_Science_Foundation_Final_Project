Imagine a future and be in it
Feel this incredible nurture, soak it in
Your past is on a loop, turn it off
See this possible future and be in it
♪
Hold fort, for love, forever
♪
We're just momentary vessels
We're just carrying
Trust your head around
Guide your stare elsewhere
Your love is already waiting
You're already in it
♪
Hold fort for love, forever
♪
Watch me form new nests
Weave a matriarchal dome
♪
Build a musical scaffolding
Between sleep and awake
Day and night (between sleep and awake)
♪
You say I mirror peoples' missions at them
Now you mirror at me who I used to be
What I gave to the world, you're giving back at me
Hold fort for love, forever
