Day by days are passing on
Let us return to take what's ours
Stars come out to take a name
They call it
They know a name
♪
They call it out
I hear what they're saying
♪
Come with us
Went to it with open arms
There goes a time that made a perfect place
For us to pray
I dream afraid we have no say
Everything is ours to have
We contemplate
♪
Everything belongs to us
We contemplate
They know a name
They call it out
I hear what they're saying
♪
Come with us
♪
Come back up and pray again
Heaven in the sullied wind
♪
It's a perfect place
