If I were the sun, way up there
I'd roll around almost anywhere
Oh, I'd be the moon when the sun goes down
Just to let you know I'm still around
That's how strong love is, oh yeah
That's how strong my love is, baby, baby
That's how strong love is, yeah
That's how strong my love is
I'd be the weeping willow, drown in my tears
You could go swimming whenever you're near
Oh, I'd be the rainbow when tears are gone
Wrap you in my colors, keep you warm
That's how strong love is, yeah, yeah, yeah
That's how strong my love is, baby, baby
That's how strong love is, yeah, yeah, yeah
That's how strong my love is
I'd be the ocean so deep and so wide
I'd shed your tears whenever you'd cry
I'd be the breeze when the storms are gone
And dry your eyes and keep you warm
That's how strong love is, yeah, yeah, yeah
That's how strong my love is, baby, baby
That's how strong love is, listen to me now
That's how strong my love is
I'd be the ocean so deep and so wide
I'd shed your tears whenever you'd cry
I'd be the breeze when the storms are gone
And dry your eyes and keep you warm
That's how strong love is, yeah, yeah, yeah
That's how strong my love is, listen to me now
That's how strong love is, wow, wow, yeah
That's how strong my love is
Listen to me
That's how strong love is, yeah, yeah, yeah
That's how strong my love is, baby, baby
That's how strong love is, oh, oh, oh
That's how strong my love is
