Been with you since grad school, no one else was like you
For real
Don't know a thing about you 'cause now I never asked you
For real
Drinking just to stay awake so I don't have to fall asleep
Next to you
There's so much more I'd rather do then lie in bed and counting sheep
Like we do
I dance another hour but I don't want to
I take another shot still I don't want to
These shots and squats are never fun without you
Yeah drinking isn't fun enough without you
♪
Drinking every cup, like we never had enough, yeah
We ruled
Memories of the days when I couldn't get enough of you
Red and blue
There's many things I wanna do, oh, darling if you only knew
If you knew
Let's travel back in time and do the things that we used to
Me and you
I dance another hour but I don't want to
I take another shot still I don't want to
These shots and squats are never fun without you
Yeah drinking isn't fun enough without you
♪
We dance another hour 'cause we want to
We take another shot just 'cause we want to
'Cause shots and squats are never fun without you
I'm just so fucking lucky to be with you
I'm just so fucking lucky to be with you
