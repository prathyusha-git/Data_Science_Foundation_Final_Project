Think about you girl
Yeah
Tell me where to go when your heart ain't in it no more, and that's all I know
Holdin' on to my soul, taught to stand tall, never fold
This the concrete that started growin' the rose
Gotta stick to the code
Fresh like Harlem, partin' disrespect, no curves is, uh
So watch how your mouth run
Used to play the field all day, instilled in me what you see today
Trapped in this rat race for snakes that only wanna eat today
So tell me where to go, where I can't feel pain no more
See, I been doin' the most, but got nothin' to show
'Posed to grow like beautiful afro
See, now I don't know, and I don't know
Back to the wall we was kept from, so
Hustle 'til the summer's up, wish you would one-up
That was all mentality, scared of bein' a casualty
Make us lose our sanity, bein' how I don't know
Was back to the wall, but we still kept our fronts up
Hustle 'til the sun up, wish a nigga would run up
That was all mentality, scared of bein' a casualty
Made us lose our sanity, bein' wooed by vanity
Tell me where to go when your heart ain't in it no more, and that's all I know
Holdin' on to my soul, taught to stand tall, never fold
This the concrete that started growin' the rose
Gotta stick to the code
Used to love her, I thought for sure that she would have my child
When I hugged her, I thought for sure she wasn't even wild
When I fucked her, was thinkin' of you 'cause I'm still a child
That's my inner child
It takes a weak-ass nigga to take a weak bitch traits
Now turn around and take that look off your face
You don't know who you are
You been workin' almost a decade, you ain't gettin' far
I took them notes you wrote and put 'em in a glass jar
Used it as a ashtray, you don't know the half of OD'ing on black tar
Oh, I forgot that wasn't me, that was some other niggas
Me and my bitch war story 'bout exes
Sometimes a breakup could feel like Brexit
Whatever, make up, you know who you mess with
And when I look back, it's still on read
And now your real life is all that you left with
Now, baby, tell me, what did you achieve
You blamin' me for the problems that you blessed with
Now, when a bitch has no identity
They have to inherit other niggas' methods
I won't pretend that my scars never bleed
I got that kids blood, I ain't even elected, hold up
It's about to get rough, uh, it's about to get hectic (chyeah)
