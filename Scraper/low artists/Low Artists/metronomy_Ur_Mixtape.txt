A murder in the skatepark
She was the most beautiful girl I've ever seen
I acted a fool
But introduced her to some cool music
At least that's the way it seemed to me
After the drop phase
I never heard from her again
I guess it just wasn't meant to be
Ten years later
I was near Old Street
And a strange ran right up to me
He said
You loved my sister
I loved your mixtape
So let's have a drink mate
I loved your mixtape
I loved your mixtape
I loved your mixtape
I loved your mixtape
I loved your mixtape
I loved your mixtape
I loved your mixtape
I loved your mixtape
I loved your mixtape
