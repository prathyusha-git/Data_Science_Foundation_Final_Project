Well you see old Annie, give her a lift
'Cause Annie's been workin' on the midnight shift
If Annie puts her hair upon her head
Paints them lips a bright bright red
Wears that dress that fits real tight
Starts stayin' out till the middle of the night
Says that her friend give her a lift
Well Annie's been workin' on the midnight shift
If she acts a little funny, seems a little strange
Starts spendin' your money for a brand new thing
Tells you that she wants to use the car
Never explains what she wants it for
Brother, it ain't no if
'Cause Annie's been workin' on the midnight shift
Well early in the mornin' when the sun comes up
You look at old Annie and she looks kinda rough
You tell her, "Honey, get outta bed"
She says, "Leave me alone, I'm just about dead"
Brother, and this ain't no if
'Cause Annie's been workin' on the midnight shift
If you got a good mama that's stayin' home
You better enjoy it 'cause it won't last long
When you think everything's all right
She starts spinnin' around in the middle of the night
Brother, that just ain't no if
'Cause Annie's been workin' on the midnight shift
Brother, this ain't no if
'Cause Annie's been workin' on the midnight shift
