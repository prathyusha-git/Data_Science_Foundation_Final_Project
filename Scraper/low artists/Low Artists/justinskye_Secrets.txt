Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Mmm, oh
Yeah
Oh no (yeah)
Not tryna hide your loving (loving)
I just need a moment
Sometimes I wanna end the call at night, and not be a problem
Open conversation (uh), can I have your patience?
Sometimes I need a little space and
I'll be, I'll be back in the morning
I know, know that you know (I know that you know)
That you'll be one of my secrets
Take it or leave it
I know (I know, know, know)
Know that you know (I know that you know, know, know)
That you'll be one of my secrets
Take it or leave it
I just need some time to myself
I don't need your help, right now
Can I put the phone back down? (No-oh-oh-oh)
I just need some time to myself
I don't need your help, right now
Lemme put the phone back down (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
I just wanna turn the lights down
Blow a tree in the background
Lying here in my night gown
Take a sip as I watch the sundown
Then I saw your text, didn't reply and now you're upset
Said there's tings that are on your chest
When you know that I just need rest, yeah, hey
I know (I know, know, know)
Know that you know (I know that you know, know, know)
That you'll be one of my secrets
Take it or leave it
I know (I know, know, know)
Know that you know (I know that you know, know, know)
That you'll be one of my secrets
Take it or leave it
I just need some time to myself
I don't need your help, right now (right now)
Can I put the phone back down? (Can I put the phone back down?)
I just need (hey) some time to myself (to myself, yeah, yeah)
I don't need your help, right now (right now)
Lemme put the phone back down (lemme put the phone back down)
I know (I know yeah), know that you know (I know that you know, yeah)
That you'll be one of my secrets
Take it or leave it (take it or leave it)
I know, know that you know (I know that you can hear me boy)
That you'll be one of my secrets (secrets)
Take it or leave it (leave)
