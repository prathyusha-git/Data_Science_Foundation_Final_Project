I didn't see it coming yeah, I know it's kind of out of the blue
It's four in the morning and I'm talking to you
I'm trying to slow the river but the memories are flooding in
Maybe I'm drawing, maybe I'll swim
It's been a long time and I know we're doing fine
But I was wondering if you're happy and if I'm ever on your mind
'Cause there's been so many nights in too many crowded rooms
Lost in a drink, talking to strangers, just wishing they were you
Just me and you, just like old times
It's always been you, just me and you, just like old times
Walking 'round the city and I'm taking in the places we've been
Looks different in daylight but it's a wonderful thing
Reading through the letters that you wrote me
For the first time in years
I couldn't help thinking was there something I missed
It's been a long time and I know we're doing fine
But I was wondering if you're happy and if I'm ever on your mind
'Cause there's been so many nights in too many crowded rooms
Lost in a drink, talking to strangers, just wishing they were you
Just me and you, just like old times
It's always been you, just me and you, just like old times
I'm not saying it's your fault (it's your fault)
It's been a lifetime building walls (building walls)
And I'm just trying to find a way to make peace with myself
With myself
It's been a long time and I know we're doing fine
But I was wondering if you're happy and if I'm ever on your mind
'Cause there's been so many nights in too many crowded rooms
Lost in a drink, talking to strangers, just wishing they were you
Just me and you, just like old times
It's always been you, just me and you, just like old times
