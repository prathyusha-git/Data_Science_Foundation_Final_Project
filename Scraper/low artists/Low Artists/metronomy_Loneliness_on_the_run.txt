How would you like to show me how it's done?
Loneliness is always on the run
Never again will you fear anyone
'Cause loneliness is always on the run
Loneliness is always on the run
Loneliness is almost doneㅤ
I never thought that I'd meet anyone
As lonely as the shadow of the Sun
Yeah, I never thought I'd fire the starting gun
Loneliness is always on the run
Loneliness is always on the run
Loneliness is almost done
Covered in dirt, my feelings hurt
Yeah, this time for real
And under a stone, I found the home
Of something appealing
Washed up, down on my luck
I found everything I need
