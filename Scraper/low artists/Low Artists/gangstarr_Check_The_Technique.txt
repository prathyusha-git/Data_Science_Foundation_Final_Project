You puny protozoa, you're so minute you didn't know the
Gang has been watchin' you, but instead of just squashin' you
I'm scoopin' you up out of the muck you wallow in
Like a chief chemist, other scientists are followin'
Plannin' to examine you on a Petri dish
Stickin' you and frickin' you, just a teeny bit
I'm clever with science, but never relyin'
On false words from cowards who forever be tryin'
Insistin' they come off, I let 'em get some off
Then come back with drum tracks their ears could get numb off
Blockbustin', like makin' love I'll never stop thrustin'
Into your system, so just listen
I'm like a neurosurgeon, operatin' with a purer version
I write prescriptions of words that fit in
They don't get prescribed as I kick it live
'Cause it's more than a style, it's conceptual genius
My effect on the scene is to project that I mean this
You deadbeat, wait until you see my next feat
I get respect for the rep when I speak, check the technique
Check the technique
Check the technique
Check the technique
Check the technique, see if you can follow it
I'm rushin' you like a defensive end
As I recommend that you comprehend
I could stomp you in a battle, contest, or war
What will occur will be the portraiture of your immature
Insecure for sure meek weak visions of grandeur
To really awaken you, I then will be breakin' you
Taxin' without action, extractin' the snake in you
Makin' you succumb to the drums of Gang Starr
By far we are truly gifted ones, son
But if you were to speculate or estimate us losin'
You'll be dyin', tryin' to face the fate of your delusions
'Cause miscalculation is all you're statin'
So I'm trumpin', puntin' punks just like footballs
'Cause I'm gonna put y'all back in the mess hall
To clean up the slop and stop all the bullcrap
Your rap's crazy wack, so don't try to pull that
You're lackin' the vernacular, I'm slappin' ya and cappin' ya
And closin' your jaw, 'cause you can't mess with Gang Starr
The Guru and Premier always dope with the blessed beats
Dance your ass off, hops, check the technique
Check the technique
Check the technique
Check the technique
Check the technique
Bon voyage, sayonara, arrivederci
Your ass gets busted, doodoo mustard, you tried to work me
You irk me, because you copy and falsify
And I don't care how many step up, 'cause you all could try
To wish and fish for a style, here's a fishin' rod
These rhymes are hittin' hard, constantly I'm gettin' large
Inevitably, I readily kick a spree
Of lyrics so deep, so don't sleep, but just peep me
Puttin' methods on records, expandin' for each millisecond
Thirty-three RPMs displays the art of men
And as my rhymin' builds, you see my time is chill
And then I look upon weak ones
I'm teachin' each one so they become redone
Essays are relayed to twist you up like French braids
Or tighter like corn braids, 'cause I got a strong rage
Force like police raids to never be delayed
I once was the least paid, but I made the grade
'Cause this ain't a slave sale, and I ain't the same stale
Rapper, no I'm not a phony microphonist with no class or
No type of real appeal or real talent
And it makes me violent, man
To see all of these peewee league MC wannabes
Makin' G's for some dumb companies
Have lots of money but no idea of what is wack and what is dope
So check out what the Guru wrote
'Cause I will prevail, give you tales as I unveil
Hell in a brain cell so I can stay paid well
Now I'm in the driver's seat and rockin' the liver beats
Bouncin' and boomin', I'm blastin' you to the next seat
Sheek and Unique with lots of kick like a cleat, check the technique
