Step up, step-step up, step up
Step-step-step-step-step up
Step-step, step up, step-step, step up
Step-step, step up
Once you step in the arena, cheater, you're gonna be amazed
When you gaze at the armor on this leader
Fully clad and glad to fight a 'cause, I won't pause
Fear is a joke, slowpoke, I'm like claws
That'll rip, 'cause your gift is merely flesh
Superficial and I wish you would give it a rest
But if you don't, I'll unsheathe my Excalibur
Like a noble knight, so meet your challenger
A true hero, while you're a true zero
Gettin' beat to a pulp, so that you can't run for help
I heard a gulp in your throat, 'cause you hope that I'll be merciful
But coo-cluck, I made you strut as I rehearse a few
Battle drills, and watch your bladder spill
Yellow fluid, check how I mellowly do it
Face defeat to this beat, you can tell I'm into it
As I'm pullin' out my lance to kill you and advance to
The winner's throne, 'cause I own you once you step in the arena
Step up, step up, step up
Step-step-step-step-step up
In the arena, or rather coliseum
There's people gatherin' by multitudes to see one
Perpetrator fall to the dust after the other
Quickly disposed of at the hand of a known brother
Born with the art in his heart that is Spartacus
And one-to-one combat Jack, just a thought of this
Match-up makes gang star wanna snatch up
One or two phrases from the new book with new pages
Of rhymes that are built like a chariot
Dope vocals carry it to the battle set
If a beat was a princess, I would marry it
But now, I must bow to the crowd as I stand proud
Victorious, glorious, understand now
'Cause battles and wars and much fights I have been through
One MC got beheaded, and you can too
Forget it, 'cause you'd rather be just a spectator
An onlooker, afraid you may get slayed
Or struck by a blow from a mic gladiator
I bet you that later, you might be sad that you played yourself
'Cause you stepped up, chest puffed out
And in just one lyric, you got snuffed out
'Cause rhymin' is serious, I'm strong, I'm like Hercules
You'll get hurt with these lines, close the curtains, please
And suckers can jet 'cause I wreck once you step in the arena
Step in fron-fron, front of my -
Step in fron-fron, front of my -
Step in fron-fron, front of my -
Step in front of my arena
Step in fron-fron, front of my -
Step in fron-fron, front of my -
Step, step-step in front, front-front my-my-my-my arena
In the arena or forum, weak MCs, I will floor 'em
Causin' mayhem, I'll slay them and the blood'll be pourin'
Furthermore, I implore that as a soldier of war
I go in only to win and be the holder of more
Trophies, titles, and triumphs, 'cause I dump all the sly chumps
I was never choosin' to lose my spot, not once
For the mere idea of an opponent that I'd fear
Is foolish, utterly, I mean, what nut'd be
Tryin' to toy with a destroyer of many?
You shifted your pants, 'cause you can't think of any
Foe that could step to this concept, so you better sit again citizen
Weak MCs, I get rid of them
Watch the way they get distraught when they get caught
In the worst positions, 'cause they didn't listen
And tried goin' up against a hungry killer who's itchin'
To maim and murder, those who claimed that they were the
Toughest ones, they get done once they step in the arena
Step-step-step in fron-fron-fron-fron-fron, front my-my-my arena
