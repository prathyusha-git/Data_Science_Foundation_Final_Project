Yo, what the deal cousin
Gave him a pound now we huggin
In the mall thuggin
Fucking spent a few hundred
Shorties must be lovin
Shit jig to my wallows(?)
They watch like mavado(?)
So I floss like a model
You ain't loungin
Til you've been countin
by the thousands
Profilin/profoundin
pushin more weight than your medallion
We be rallin
Lockin blocks down just like the island
Dough pilin, we keeps it in the family like Italians
Ballin, custom chores, Jordan's and some icebergs
(?) Nice curves
girlfriend with the white fur
Pushed up feelin like some shots of tequila
Said her man's a dealer
With all these bags from Anne Taylor
He got to be, but you hot to me
You under lock and key, laid it down properly
This canister(?) is watchin me
Moved in me sloppily
Prepare for the fallout
We gas to blow the wall out
Clear the mall out

Yuh, don't be mad at me
I used to be king
ragged D fiends nagging me
Shit I had to breathe
Gradually, rhyme casually
Sharp hazardly
Vaseline slick shit
Green stick shit
Honey got some mean lipstick
My knots this thick
But cops frisk us
The block whispers
That we need to stop
How we coon
But you can guess like them jeans u rock
But now I'm rollin right
Cause I had four faces
Fightin four cases
In the north face and (?)
Shorty lookin innocent there
Nothin innocent here
Give us a year you really see clear
Through these cartiers
Shark skin is what I prolly wear
Designed by Pierre, trust me
And look lovely with it
Cap a 4.2 and get ugly with it
Snugly fitted rugby hittin
Fitted in my coogi knitted
Compliments on the doobie did it
Got the movie rented if the crew be with it yo

Most times I'm casual
but easily I switch
To some fly shit
Like some silk suits
by Paul smith
And purchase some kicks
by Kenneth Cole
Cop a hilfiger
a polo goose for when it's ycold
Armani and Gotier specs cover my eyes
The definition of jiggy so you best to recognize
at the mall I'm baggin up much more than gear
Victoria be whisperin mad secrets in my ear
She wanted me to knock her in the back of foot locker
I chuckled as she kicked more game than soccer
Others try to copy
I see 'em when they mock me
Baseball cap bent
The fresh end in (?)
All the way from Green Acres to the Beverly Center
Heads turned and i'm the main concern when I enter
And I be square
niggas wouldn't even dare
With that fake thugish rugish
when them Brooklyn kids be in there
Saw (?) And a sweet for my girl
Styling on the cellphone smilin
it's my world
Can't forget the Avarex
pocket for theroyalty checks
My crew be showin Loyalty
plus upmost respect
Yo son, go pioneer those bimbos
while I get some timbos
Later on that night
you'll find the nymphos
That's how it goes cause mad heads be in the mall
Let's breeze we got a show
Plus I got another phone call
