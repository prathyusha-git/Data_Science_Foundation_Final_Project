To be honest, I couldn't live your life
But you survived
Became a friend of mine
Blessed us with a little time
Rain down on me
Positive vibes only
Nostalgia golem of memory
Staring at the meat
You had refused to eat
It never occurred to me
Had you felt your own pity?
If you can see me
Positive vibes only
Nostalgia golem of memory
