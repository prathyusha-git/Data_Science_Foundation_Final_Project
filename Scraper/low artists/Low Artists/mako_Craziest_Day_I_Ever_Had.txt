Can I tell you bout the craziest day I ever had
It started with a boy just coming from his past
Then you never knew what day got in his plans
All I know
I was driving down Sunset
Down on my luck, car broke down
I was sticking my thumb out
Driver had the door up, said her name was Dora
Had a cute smile and a tatoo on her forehead
Come and play, come and play, come and play with me
Far away, far away, far away
Oh we drank all day
And we danced all night
I woke up inside a church somewhere on the west side
No regrets
We're running out of time
I know
We only get one shot

Somehow we landed in a jail cell, wasn't half bad
A couple tall tails and made a couple friends
I could fit it in able locked up for revenge
All I know
He was risking too deeper, handed out his gun
He used to be a preacher then he found love
Saying "If it come easy, it weren't much"
I never thought teachers come in hand cuffs
And he said
Come and play, come and play, come and play with me
Far away, far away, far away
Oh we drank all day
And we danced all night
I woke up inside a church somewhere on the west side
No regrets
