(Greg N-I, N-N-N-I, N-N-N-I-C-E)
(Greg N-I, N-I), aww yeah, it's another Gang Starr sure shot
Uh, featuring the one and only
Handle it, handle it Roy, Nice & Smooth
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Ah Gang Starr has gots to be the sure shot
Nice & Smooth has gots to be the sure shot
Ah Gang Starr has gots to be the sure shot
Nice & Smooth has gots to be the sure shot
Ah Greg Nice, ah Greg N-I-C-E
Dame un beso, ah oui, oui
Rock for a fee, not for free
Maybe I'll do it for charity
Now my employer or my employee
Is makin' Greg N-I-C-E very M-A-D
Don't ever, ever think of jerkin' me
I work too hard for my royalty
Put lead in ya ass and drink a cup of tea
Peace to Red Alert and Kid Capri
Ooh la la, ah oui, oui
I say Muhammad Ali, ya say Cassius Clay
I say butter, you say Parkay
It's alright if ya wanna make a sway on my way uptown
Took the deuce to the tre, I originate
They duplicate, I praise the Lord and keep the faith
It's alright, keep bitin' at the bait
'92, uh, one year later
Peace out, Premier, take me out wit' da fader
Ok, gang
O-O-Ok gang
O-O-O-Ok gang
He, here he is
I chant, "Eenie, meenie, miny, moe"
I wreck the mic like a pimp, pimps hoes
Here's how it goes, I am a genius, I mean this
I shake this, you'll take this, I'm kinda fiendish
You wish that you could come into my neighborhood
Meaning my mental state, still I'm five foot eight
Crazy as I wanna be, 'cause I make it orderly
You could say I'm sorta da boss, so get lost
The brotha who will make you change opinions
Dominions, I'm in them when it's time to kick shit from
The heart, plus I get a piece of the action
Feelin' satisfaction from the street crowd reaction
Chumps pull guns when they feel afraid, too late
When they dip in the kick, they get sprayed
Lemonade was a popular drink and it still is
I get more props and stunts than Bruce Willis
A poet like Langston Hughes and can't lose when I cruise
Out on the expressway
Leavin' the Bodega, I say "Suave"
Premier's got more beats than barns got hay
Clips are inserted into my gun
So I can take the money, never have to run
S-S-S-Smooth B
S-S-S-Smooth B
S-S-S-Smooth B
Smooth B
Yo, Keithy E, I left my Phillie at home, do you have another?
I wanna get blunted, my brother
Now may I make a mark? Then make a spark
Over this phat track, or should I say dope beat?
Subtract, delete all of the wick-wack that wanna be abstract
But they lack the new knack that's comin' from way, way back
Ayo, Premier, please pass that Buddha sack
You hear we quit? No way, bullshit
I told ya before we come back wit' more hits
I provide bright flavor, so you can sketch me
Do me a favor, don't try to catch me
Slightly ahead of the game, I'm not a lame
Ask him, he'll tell you the same, he knows my name
Smooth, I drop jewels like paraphernalia
I'm infallible, not into failure
Like a rhinoceros, my speed is prosperous
And pure knowledge expands from my esophagus
I write in the night to bring truth to the light
My dialogue is my own 'cause Smooth B will never bite
After the tour quits, I come back with more hits
After the tour quits, I come back with more hits
After the tour quits, I come, come, come back
Come back, come back, come back, come back with more hits
