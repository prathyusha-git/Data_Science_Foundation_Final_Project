Last night I packed up all my clothing
Patched up all the holes in yesterday
I tried to make it on my own here
It gets a little lonely way down here
But my father told me, "Son, stand up tall
The world is too crowded to live without love"
And that's when she walked right through my front door
Like some kind of magic, oh, she's got me asking
Is this really real life?

Is this really real life?

Last night I wrote my own confession
Counted up my blessings from today
You got anything to slow my beat at night
It's just a little hard to believe you're here
But my father told me, "Son, stand up tall
The world is too crowded to live without love"
And that's when she walked right through my front door
Like some kind of magic, oh, she's got me asking
Is this really real life?
♪
Is this really real life?
♪
Is it coming from nowhere?
I'm worn out at night things
She told me she don't care
She told me she loved me
You can't buy the sunset
A kiss on the door step
Making a young man keep asking all night
Is this really real life?

Is this really real life?

Is this really real life?
