Uh, this that irregular wave
I'm smokin' somethin' unusual, but to me, it's just regular haze
They comin' to clean up my cuticles
Tired of smokin' these regular strains
You get used to these crackers accusin' you
When you Black, it's a regular thing
Uh, girl, it's been minutes, it's been hours
And it's been days, bitch
I pray for you, always, it's so tragic, babe
Uh, yeah, yeah, your path is lookin' like shit (like shit)
Your bag is lookin' like shit (like shit)
That ass is lookin' like shit (like shit)
Almost thirty, don't know who you is, bitch, work it out
You ain't even on shift, mm, look (everything about JPEGs, I like)
Back in this bitch lookin' bummy
The ket got my shoulder leanin' like I'm Dro
All of that royalty, power, that fame and respect
It can't change the fact that you a hoe

When you could end up goin' out like The Crow
Niggas want action, I'm not into actin'
Put you on the screen like I'm Christopher Nol'
