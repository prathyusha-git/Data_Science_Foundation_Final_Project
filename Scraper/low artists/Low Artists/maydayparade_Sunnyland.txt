You were cynical the last time that I saw you
And I thought that's what a real grown-up looks like
You were happy once
But that was such a long time ago now
Gravity took something from your light
And I thought back to the years that we played baseball
How I tried, but I struck out so many times
But then once I hit the ball and sailed over the fence
I felt my gut all fill up with pride
So take me back to Sunnyland
So I can find the light again
So take me back to Sunnyland
So I can find the light again
And I dreamt about an old abandoned hospital
And I met up with my friends to go inside
Well, I left something important back in Sunnyland
And it's something that I know I'll never find
So take me back to Sunnyland
So I can find the light again
So take me back to Sunnyland
So I can find the light again
♪
Can you tell me how long now 'til Winter is done?
Wake me up when it's over and Spring has begun
Give me all your bad days, it'll be over soon
Just as long as I have you
So take me back to Sunnyland
So I can find the light again
So take me back to Sunnyland
So I can find the light again
Take me back to Sunnyland
Take me back to Sunnyland
