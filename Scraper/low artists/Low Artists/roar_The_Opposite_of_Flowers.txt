Is there something wrong with me?
If I hate to see you happy
And everything feels empty
Is there something wrong with me?
When you tell me that it's nothing
But I cannot let that dog sleep
No one thinks about you
Even half as much as you think that they do
Even half as much as you think that they do
Find a way to love when you feel lonely
Find a way to love when you feel nothing
Find a way to love in spite of everything
