I'm homesick
Got a lot on my mind
I'm pathetic
Never know when I'm right
rock bottom
I'm painting a smile for now
I've got a feeling you're the reason
I'll let you down, down, down.
♪
I'm lonesome
Save a photo for that
I'm on fire
You're the flame in my head that I can't put out
maybe I'm the first one
to fall apart on my own
don't act like I'm the first one
why don't you stand in line and watch me do it again
I'm blaming everything that's happening
All on me
All on me
And who will be the first to finally see?
Save me
Save me
We're all liars and let truth be told
I'm lost and so afraid.
And I won't come down
