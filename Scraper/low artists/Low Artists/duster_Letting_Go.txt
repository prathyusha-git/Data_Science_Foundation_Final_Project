Waste away till you're all used up
Walk away till you lose your touch
But someone won't be there anymore
Lost again in the same old muss
I remember how it was once
But memories aren't doing me any good
Oh
♪
Oh I just can't do it anymore
Let it come get the best of us
Letting go 'cause it takes too much
Until they can't take us anymore
Tumble down and all broken up
I remember how it was once
But memories aren't doing me any good
Oh
♪
Oh I just can't do it anymore
Oh
