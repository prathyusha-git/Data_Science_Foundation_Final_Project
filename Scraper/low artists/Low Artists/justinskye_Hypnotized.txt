Put it down on me
Do it good, lose if you change on me
Every night, what I like? You inside
Ain't a damn thing, this is so big
Got me hypnotized 'cause
If I know one thing
You ain't earn trust
Givin' all this energy to us
If I'm wasting all my time on lust
Damn ain't enough
I get it in my head, I feel like
You made me this way, that's real life
I'm feeling away, I can't lie
She gettin' my way, I just might
Might smack this ho, ho
She gettin' my way, I just might
Lose all control
She gettin' my way
Boo, I'm the only reason anybody look at you
If you ain't? My agenda
These days, niggas think they sweet till they end up
Bein' just a friend of me, yeah
I get it in my head, I feel like
You made me this way, that's real life
I'm feeling away, I can't lie
She gettin' my way, I just might
