Katy, don't cry, I know
You're trying your hardest, and the hardest part is letting
Go of the nights we shared
Ocala is calling, and you know it's haunting
But compared to your eyes
Nothing shines quite as bright
And when we look to the sky
It's not mine, but I want it so
Let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
I know he's there, and
You're probably hanging out and making eyes
While across the room he stares
I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
And ask my girl to dance, she'll say yes
Because these words were never easier for me to say
Or her to second-guess, but I guess
That I can live without you, but
Without you, I'll be miserable at best
You're all that I hoped I'd find in every single way
And everything I would give is everything you couldn't take
'Cause nothing feels like home, you're a thousand miles away
And the hardest part of living is just taking breaths to stay
'Cause I know I'm good for something, I just haven't found it yet
And I need it
So let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
I know he's there, and
You're probably hanging out and making eyes
While across the room he stares
I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
And ask my girl to dance, she'll say yes
Because these words were never easier for me to say
Or her to second-guess, but I guess
That I can live without you, but
Without you, I'll be miserable at best
♪
And this will be the first time in a week
That I'll talk to you, and I can't speak
It's been three whole days since I've had sleep
'Cause I dream of his lips on your cheek
And I got the point that I should leave you alone
But we both know that I'm not that strong
And I'll miss the lips that made me fly
So let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
I know he's there, and
You're probably hanging out and making eyes
While across the room he stares
I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
And ask my girl to dance, she'll say yes
Because these words were never easier for me to say
Or her to second-guess, but I guess
That I can live without you, but
Without you, I'll be miserable
And I can live without you, but
Without you, I'll be miserable
And I can live without you, but
Oh, without you, I'll be miserable at best
