Mmm mmm
You should come and dance with me, yeah
Mmm
Feel my soul, I'm feelin' all your
Mmm
Crush it up, don't take too much
Mmm, mmm
Fire started dominatin'
Mmm, too hot, hot
And you make me so mmm
Too hot, can't stop
Boy, you better slow down
The music's so loud
Fallin' right out
Ah-ah, babe, I see the sound
Ah-ah, babe, I'm floatin' off the ground
Don't think I wanna come down (mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm)
A little game, that we both play
Don't know my name, I don't mind
It's okay, you'll find a metaphor
Where are your friends?
Let them all in, they'll be mine
You'll be over here meltin' with me
On the floor, I want more
You see, I don't really care 'bout who you be
Know it's late, it's okay 'cause
I don't want the night to end
Mmm mmm
You should come and dance with me, yeah
Mmm
I'll fulfill your fantasies
Mmm
Damn, I think I took too much
Mmm mmm
Fire started dominatin'
Mmm, too hot, hot
And you make me so mmm
Too hot, can't stop
Boy, you better slow down
The music's so loud
Fallin' right out
Ah-ah, babe, I see the sound
Ah-ah, babe, I'm floating off the ground
Don't think I wanna come down (mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm)
A little game that we both play
Don't know my name, I don't mind
It's okay, you'll find a metaphor
Where are your friends?
Let them all in, they'll be mine
You'll be over here meltin' with me
On the floor, I want more
You see, I don't really care 'bout who you be
Know it's late, it's okay 'cause
I don't want the night to end
Mmm mmm
Mmm mmm
Mmm mmm
Mmm mmm
