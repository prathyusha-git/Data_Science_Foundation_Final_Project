(Tell me when you're ready)
(Okay)
Every single thing you try to hold will
Fade like a dying ember
Gasping like a foal thrown in the water
You will refuse surrender
Dismantling
Muscle memory, piece by piece
Taken by a light with pitiless eyes
You were afraid of leaving
Bones are razed in time
I hope you'll find a lull that feels like breathing
Dismantling
Muscle memory, piece by piece
