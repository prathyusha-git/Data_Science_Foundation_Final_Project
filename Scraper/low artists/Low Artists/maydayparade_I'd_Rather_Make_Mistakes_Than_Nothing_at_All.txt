All these days have turned these months into a year
And I've been spending every second, wishing I could disappear
And I know one day I'll start to speak again
I just need some inspiration I can rightfully defend
And I'm close
When it's hurting bad, it only gets worse
I sing for the children of the earth
I've broken every rule that I've known
Since you told me that I've got to have passion
Honestly, you've got me all wrong
I am just a boy on my own
And looking for some promising action
Tell me what it takes to move on
When I'm gone, I can't keep up with what's at home
And I'd love to make it right, but there are things I can't control
But I'm close
When it's over, tell me when to let go
I'll be the last one to know
When you were at the top of my list
I promised you that this wouldn't happen
How do I begin to explain?
Crimson lips and permanent kiss
You loved me on the back of a napkin
Maybe I should throw it away?
Make a move, so carefully
Cut me down, and let me bleed
And I'll slowly walk away
(Oh, hey!)
Now you wanna talk, so fitting
I remember times when you were
Holding by a thread of a chance
You'll make it out alive, God willing
All you need is time, and it's been
Getting awful close to a year
This is so messed up, but if you
Give me all your love, then we'll show
Angels up above that we can
Make it out alive, God willing
I remember times when you were
Holding by a thread of a chance
I've broken all the rules that I've known
You told me that I've got to have passion
Honestly, you've got me all wrong
I am just a boy on my own
And looking for some promising action
Tell me what it takes to move on
Make a move, so carefully
Get me down, and let me bleed
And I'll slowly walk away
