I am leaving this harbor
Giving urban a farewell
Its habitants seem too keen on God
I cannot stomach their rights and wrongs
I have lost my origin
And I don't want to find it again
Whether sailing into nature's laws
And be held by ocean's paws
Wanderlust relentlessly craving
Wanderlust! peel off the layers
Until we get to the core
♪
Did I imagine it would be like this?
Was it something like this I wished for?
Or will I want more?
♪
Lust for comfort
Suffocates the soul
Relentless restlessness
Liberates me (Sets me free)
I feel at home
Whenever the unknown surrounds me
I receive its embrace
Aboard my floating house
♪
Wanderlust relentlessly craving
Wanderlust peel off the layers
Until we get to the core

Did I imagine it would be like this?
Was it something like this I wished for?
Or will I want more?
Wanderlust from island to island
Wanderlust united in movement
Wonderful! I'm joined with you

Wanderlust
Wanderlust
Can you spot a pattern?
Relentlessly restless
Restless, relentlessly
Restless, relentlessly
Restless, relentlessly
Restless, relentlessly
(Can you spot a pattern?)
Restless, relentlessly
Restless, relentlessly
(Can you spot a pattern?)
Restless, relentlessly
Restless, relentlessly.
