It's okay to feel the way you do
Swimming in a love that they gave you
You drown
But they will never love you like I do
In this ocean, you're all I see
You're not a mess, no, you're an empath on a messy earth
Can't understand why somebody
As special as you wants to fit in so bad that it hurts
Your worth isn't based off of how much you earn
You say you feel empty the more you consume
Do we blame the flower when it doesn't bloom
Or blame the terrain it was planted into?
When you walk in a room, everyone stares
You spent thе whole morning on makeup and hair
Still all you see are your flaws
You nеver would see what they see when you look in the mirror
Nobody compares you like nobody else
Being trapped in an app feels like livin' in Hell
See, we live in a world where we're taught
That it's better to be anyone else but ourselves, damn
Your feelings aren't real, your friends are all fake
You're tired as fuck, you just need a break
Don't know if you know
The lower your self-esteem goes, the more that these companies make
The more of yourself that you hate
The more that you look to replace, the more you'll be willing to pay
This hole got me stuck in a game
That you didn't even realize you were playin', so
It's okay to feel the way you do
Swimming in a love that they gave you
You drown
But they will never love you like I do
In this ocean, you're all I see
The truth is, you're as beautiful as beautiful gets
Wish you knew your flaws were just a shift in perception
Away from them being a gift
Does the dopamine hit when you post?
Worth it when you know people pick apart all of your pics?
You're sick of the comments that say, "Does she even respond?"
When you don't, then they call you a bitch
It's just how it is, it's sad, it's true, man
Think we forgot what it means to be human
These apps are detrimental to our mental health
So we go buy an app to improve it
And call that "improvement," but I digress
I know you're livin' with a lot of stress
Tryin' your best to find the line between work and rest
Haven't found it yet, damn
They see you were thick in the head
But not what goes on in your head, damn, yeah
Ask you how you are in the sheets
But not why you're not leavin' bed, damn, yeah
They sit there and stare at your lips
But don't hear a thing that you said, damn, yeah
They come out the woodwork
And then they get mad when you leave 'em on read
I know that you no longer wanna pretend
Like all the bullshit hasn't taken its toll
You're tired of strivin' to be what they want you to be
When you know you just don't fit the mold
"Sit there and look pretty" is what you were told
By someone you used to consider a friend
You ask him, "How am I supposed to feel pretty
With all of these hideous thoughts in my head?"
Never saw him again, at first you were hurt
That they thought your image was all you were worth
But then you realized you were wasting your time
On opinions of people who make you feel worse
You feel like you're cursed, you wanna move on
Remove every contact you have in your phone
You realize the more and more people pretend like they love you
The more you feel like you're alone, just know
It's okay to feel the way you do
Swimming in a love that they gave you
You drown
But they will never love you like I do
In this ocean
(They will never love you like I do)
They will never love you like I do
(Swimming in a love that they gave you)
(You drown)
(They will never love you like I do)
They will never love you like I do
(In this ocean)
