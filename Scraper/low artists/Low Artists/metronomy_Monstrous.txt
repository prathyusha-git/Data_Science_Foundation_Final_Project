Everything and nothing matters now, with you
hold your hair back if you feel unwell, do you?
Every nights the mark of a new day
and every day's the mark of something new
Promise that you'll follow me,
This wasn't meant for me and you
So hold on tight to everything you love
Honestly its all I care about
Hold on tight to everything you love
Honestly its all I'm thinking of
Hold on tight to everything you care about
Hopelessly it's all I dream about
Hold on tight because this may be the last time we dance
Didn't say you couldn't do it well
Only said I have to try again
I could never stop from listening in
Someones left the car engine running
Every nights the mark of a new day
And everyday's the mark of something new
Promise that you'll follow me,
I couldn't stand to be alone
And it could wait
wait for the after show
I've got four more so why you bawling for?
I've got to hold back to then
And I couldn't have ever swam better,
but you could have turned a blind eye
But I've gone over the road
and I'm gonna go this time
So hold on tight to everything you love
Honestly its all I care about
Hold on tight to everything you love
Honestly its all I'm thinking of
Hold on tight to everything you care about
Hopelessly it's all I dream about
Hold on tight because this may be the last time we dance
