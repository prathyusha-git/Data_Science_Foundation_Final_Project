No amount of money
Could ever buy my love
'Cos there's no prettier face
Could take your place
No amount of rivalry
Nobody but you gets to me
I'm way past falling in love with you
I got what I want
Nobody can take it away
I'll keep what I got
I'm never gonna lose it
I got what I want
No friendly persuasion
Could ever change my mind
Like water off a duck's back
It's wasted time
I got what I want
Nobody can take it away
I'll keep what I got
I'm never gonna lose it
I got what I want
Always knew what I wanted
So I've never been satisfied
I never settled for second best
And I wasn't denied
I got what I want
Nobody can take it away
I'll keep what I got
I'm never gonna lose it
I got what I want
Nobody can take it away
I got what I want
Never gonna lose it
I got what I want
Nobody can take it away
I'll keep what I got
Never gonna lose it
I got what I want
Nobody can take it away
I'll keep what I got
