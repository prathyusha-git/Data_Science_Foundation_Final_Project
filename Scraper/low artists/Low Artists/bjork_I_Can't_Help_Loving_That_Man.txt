Fish got to swim, birds got to fly
I got to love one man 'til I die
Can't help loving that man of mine
Maybe he's lazy, maybe he's slow
Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I know
Can't help loving that man of mine
And when he's away
That's a rainy day
But when he's back
The day is fine, the sun will shine
He can stay out as long as can be
For without him ain't no home for me
Can't help loving that man of mine
Show me...
Oh, fish got to swim, birds got to fly
