Once was a sweet thing, baby
We held that love in our hands
And now I reach to kiss your lips
It just don't mean a thing
And that's a cold shot, baby
Yeah, that's a drag
A cold shot, baby
I've let our love go bad
Remember the way that you loved me
Do anything I say
But now I see you out somewhere
You won't give me the time of day
And that's a cold shot, girl
Yeah, that's a drag
That's a cold shot, baby
We've let our love go bad
♪
I really meant I was sorry
For ever causing you pain
You showed your appreciation
By walking out anyway
And that's a cold shot, baby
Yeah, that's a drag
And that's a cold shot, baby
We've let our love go bad
So sad
Too bad
So sad
Don't let our true love run cold
