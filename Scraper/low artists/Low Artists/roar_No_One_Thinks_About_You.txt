Does it get lonely spending all of your time in the future?
Even the past became a painful and dull architecture
No one thinks about you even half as much as you think that they do
No one thinks about you even half as much as you think that they do
Even half as much as you think that they do
Even half as much as you think that they do
Tighten your grip and it will break you apart like a cancer
And you had been tricked into believing it gets you an answer
I laid waste at a breakneck pace
I was waging war
I will grind myself like a corpse
No one thinks about you even half as much as you think that they do
No one thinks about you even half as much as you think that they do
Even half as much as you think that they do
Even half as much as you think that they do
