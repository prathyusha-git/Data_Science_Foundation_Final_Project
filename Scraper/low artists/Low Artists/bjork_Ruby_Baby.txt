I've got a girl and Ruby is her name
She don't love me but I love her just the same
Ruby, Ruby, how I want you
Like a ghost I'm gonna haunt you
Ruby, Ruby, when will you be mine?
Oh, each time I see my baby my heart cries
I'm gonna steal her away from all those guys
From the sunny day I met you
Made a bet that I would get you
Ruby, Ruby, when will you be mine?

Got some loving money too
Gonna give it all to you

When will you be mine?
My Ruby, Ruby when will you be mine?
