You wanna explain, that's why you called
Save your breath It doesn't matter at all,
not now, my friend
You played your cards, and you made your choice
I don't wanna listen to your voice,
not now, my friend
I've found a new part to play in life
There's different actors on my stage
I'll set the pace in a world without you
I don't wanna hear the things that you say
'cos my life is over with you
Now you know what's on my mind
Don't call again 'cos you will find
I won't be here
You chose your path to walk along
Now I can sing a different song
I hope that's clear
I've found a new part to play in life
There's different actors on my stage
Good bye, my love, and don't feel sad
just because I'm feeling glad
that you're not here
You'll go your way and I'll go mine
Maybe we'll meet some other time
Goodbye, my love
