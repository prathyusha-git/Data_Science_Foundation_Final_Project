Never gonna get it right
Always running out of time
Well I don't mind
♪
Every time I try and speak
No one's even listening
But I don't mind (mmmm)
But I can't escape it anymore
I'm alone in this
If I can't decipher what is real
Then maybe it's all fake
Inside it almost feels like I've been here once before
And I can't do this anymore

We were such a work of art
But every masterpiece falls apart
Well I don't mind
♪
If we go down in history
And we forget everything
I won't mind it
I won't mind
But I can't escape it anymore
I'm alone in this
If I can't decipher what is real
Then maybe it's all fake
Inside it almost feels like I've been here once before
And I can't do this anymore
