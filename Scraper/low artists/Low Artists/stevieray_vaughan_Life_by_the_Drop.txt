Hello there, my old friend
Not so long ago it was 'til the end
We played outside in the pouring rain
On our way up the road, we started over again
You're living out dreams of you on top
My mind is aching, oh, Lord, it won't stop
That's how it happens living life by the drop
Up and down that road in our worn out shoes
Talking 'bout good thangs and signing the blues
You went your way and I stayed behind
We both knew it was just a matter of time
Living out dreams of you on top
My mind is aching, oh, Lord, it won't stop
That's how it happens living life by the drop
♪
No waste of time, we're alive today
Turning up the past, there's no easier way
Time's been between us, a means to an end
God, it's good to be here walking together, my friend
Living a dream, my mind stop aching
That's how it happens living life by the drop
That's how it happens living life by the drop
That's how it happens living life by the drop
