Life is good looking through the eyes of love
Beautiful looking through the eyes of love
But you know, I'm telling you, girl
Life ain't all the same
Take a look, take a look around you now
You'll find that though it seems great
Life is just a crazy scene
You and me seem to see right through a haze
People laugh but we both know that it pays
But you know, I'm telling you, girl
Life ain't all the same
Take a look, take a look around you now
You'll find that though it seems great
Life is just a crazy scene
I want you to know how I feel
When you go the world ain't real
I want you to know how I feel
When you go the world ain't real
It's all balanced on the keen edge of a knife
Let's all laugh at the craziness of life
But you know, I'm telling you, girl
Life ain't all the same
Take a look, take a look around you now
You'll find that though it seems great
Life is just a crazy scene
