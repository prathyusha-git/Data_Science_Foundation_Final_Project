I don't see
Water images appear in front of me
I am free
I am not bound to the difference between
The real and the real to me
And the only other one who I could ever believe
Is the one that I could feel but never really see
Looking from the island at the peak
You won't say why you would deny me your embrace
Swimming in the sea
I think I understand why you hate me
For what I've done, for what I haven't done
And the only other one who I could ever believe
Is the one that I could feel but never really see
Looking from the island at the peak
