Some say I'm the one
With the luck to make it out alive
And I'll stay on the run
'Cause it's the only way to survive
Now, she waits (she waits)
In the dark (in the dark)
Oh, and whispers as she pulls you in
So if you think you're strong
Well, boy, you're dead wrong
'Cause you know she was born to win (ooh-whoa-oh)
She's my unlucky lady
She's my unlucky lady
Oh, the spider inside her inspired her
To come out and play
Ooh, boy, come out and play (ah, ooh-whoa-oh)
(Come, come, come, come, come)
(Ooh-whoa-oh, ooh-whoa-oh)
Now she's in the mirror
Tellin' you to ruin what you see (what you see)
And always gettin' off (gettin' off)
On all your insecurities
'Cause you've been shot (shot)
Too many times trying to get away
Oh, that lady's gonna make you pay
She's my unlucky lady
She's my unlucky lady
Oh, the spider inside her inspired her
The spider inside her inspired her
To come out and play
Oh, boy, come out and play (ah, ooh-whoa-oh)
(Come, come, come, come, come)
(Ooh-whoa-oh, ooh-whoa-oh)
You better run, you better hide
You better pray that she don't ever find you
But when she calls in the dead of night
Yeah, you know
(You know she's my) my unlucky lady
She's my unlucky lady (she's mine, ah, ah, she's mine)
The spider inside her inspired her
The spider inside her inspired her
To come out and play
Oh boy, come out and play (ahh, ooh-whoa-oh)
Come, come, come, come, come
(Ooh-whoa-oh, ooh-whoa-oh)
Oh, won't you come out and play
The spider inside her inspired her to come out and play
