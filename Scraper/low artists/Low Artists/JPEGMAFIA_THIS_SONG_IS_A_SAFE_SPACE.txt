I don't wanna cry no more, yah
I don't wanna die no more, yah
Cause I don't wanna rap no more
When white people rap I think of suicide (Cuck, cuck)
Heard your track bro, now I wanna die (Cuck, cuck, cuck)
Tats on my face I'm so fucking pie(Woo) (Cuck)
Imma turn the damn trap into Columbine (Cuck)
Where my deal at? Where my steel at?
Boy I kill CACs, with that concealed black
I ain't a rapper bruh
I don't feel that
I'm just a cracker bro
Get hated everywhere I go
I pulled up on a trust fund kid
Made him beg for his iPhone 6
I know his momma paid all that shit
I caught that cracker with a banzai kick
I take snaps when I hit that lick
I'm too cold when I'm sipping on the apple berry
I change modes when I'm kicking it with Katy Perry's
My black soul ain't enough for me to make a living
White girl got an ass like Meg Griffin
I told that bitch to grab a fork and hit the damn kitchen
Bust a nut up on her face and call it reparitions (hold up) reparations
My reputation got me banned from all of your fucking safe spaces
All them pronouns you still racist
They don't wanna be white anymore
They don't wanna be white anymore
They're more than just white now
Swagger
I got a white boy I'm think I finna tat his face
Got (a) white boy who rap I think he's trans-race
I know an Asian girl with cornrows she says cause she based
I know a white girl with grills she says it's cause she's from the bay
I know a white girl who think she ain't cause she speak "ándale"
I know white people who think that they very fond of me (Llama)
I know white people rap only cause the economy
They don't wanna be white anymore
They're more than just white now
Face tat my white boy
Facetime his white mom
Face palm his white dad
Face fuck my white girl
Facetime her white dad
Face tat my white girl
Facetime her white mom
Face palm his white dad
Face fuck my white boy
Facetime her white mom
When white people rap I think of suicide (Suicide)
White people rap, feel like I've lost some shit that's mine (I lost my mind)
When white people rap I feel like it's not mine (I lost my mind)
When white people rap they make a pretty dime (I wanna cry)
Aight, when did you come in though, like?
Yeah, yeah
Tired of, all this passive aggressive...
Aggressiveness...
And false assertiveness
You know?
I don't wanna lie no more (Huh, huh huh)
I don't wanna have to try no more (Huh, huh huh)
I can never cry no more (Huh, huh huh)
I don't even wanna hear a white nigga speak
I don't ever wanna see a white nigga teach
If me and a white nigga ever meet
I'ma turn his ass into dark meat!
Food ass niggas make a nigga wanna eat
Fruity ass niggas make a nigga want beef
Fucking white boys keep wearing shark teeth
Niggas talk money
But I know that talk cheap
You gon learn today
If you try and chalk me
Bitch you better pray before you try and cross me
You just hardly living
I'm just killing softly
Snatch you at that Starbucks
While you drinking coffee
Catch you in the club
While you dancing off beat
All of us in the VIP
Some of us in here
All fake I.D.'s
Shallow ass niggas know
We came here deep
Grew up on a farm
And you used to herd sheep
But we the black sheep, white sheep can't beat
Soon as I roll my weed, they wanna hang by me
I'm not the type of nigga you can hang by a tree
Bitch I'll beat your ass like my name Ali
And I'll get you laid under a white sheet
Shoutout JPEG man, this a nice beat
We hate ya'll
(I don't need your wife no more)
We hate ya'll
(No, I don't need your hype no more)
We hate ya'll
(Pussy, go and type some more)
We hate ya'll
(Turn your location on, fuck you hiding for?)
We hate ya'll
We hate ya'll
Bitch, we hate ya'll
We hate ya'll
Ooh
Delete all this shit, Peggy!
