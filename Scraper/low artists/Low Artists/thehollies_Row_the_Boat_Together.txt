Standing by a riverside
A river so deep and so wide
Current's too strong for only one man
I know because I tried
I've got eight oars
Four on either side
Is there anybody with me?
Eight hands, four willing hearts
Won't someone answer my plea?
Well, I got in the boat
Stayed afloat
Some way across I was tiring
Well, I need someone to help me
To get to the other side
Along came son of Alabama south
He said "I heard you calling
If you don't mind the colour of my skin
I'll help you not to fall in"
Then suddenly Joe walk out of Tokyo
"If my eyes don't make you nervous
I used to handle a junk back home"
Said "Can I be of service?"
Well, we got in the boat
Stayed afloat
Halfway across we were tiring
We got to row this boat together
To get to the other side
Two more oars
Only one seat left
One more person to lean on
A brotherhood boat to a land called home
With our share of freedom
We got in the boat
Stayed afloat
There's no need to be tiring
We rowed this boat together
Happiness meets the other side
We rowed this boat together
Happiness meets the other side
We rowed this boat together
Happiness meets the other side
