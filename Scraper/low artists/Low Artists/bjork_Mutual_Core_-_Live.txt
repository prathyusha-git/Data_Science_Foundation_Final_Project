I shuffle around the tectonic plates in my chest
You know I gave it all try to match our continents
To change seasonal shift to form a mutual core
As fast as your fingernail grows the Atlantic ridge drifts
To counteract distance, you know I gave it all
Can you hear the effort of the magnetic strife?
Shuffling of columns to form a mutual core
This eruption undoes stagnation
You didn't know I had it in me
Withheld your love, an unspent capsule
I didn't know you had it in you
You hid the key to our continuity
I didn't know you had it in you
This eruption undoes stagnation
You didn't know, you didn't know
What you resist persists, nuance makes heat
To counteract distance, I know you gave it all
Offered me harmony if things were done your way
My Eurasian plate subsumed forming a mutual core
This eruption undoes stagnation
You didn't know I had it in me
Withheld your love, an unspent capsule
I didn't know you had it in you
You hid the key to our continuity
I didn't know you had it in you
This eruption undoes stagnation
You didn't know
you didn't know
