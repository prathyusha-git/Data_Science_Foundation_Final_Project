I can sense it
Something important
Is about to happen
It's coming up
It takes courage to enjoy it
The hardcore and the gentle big-time sensuality, oh and amazing
We just met
And I know I'm a bit too intimate
But something huge is coming up
And we're both included
It takes courage to enjoy it
The hardcore and the gentle big-time sensuality, oh-I
I don't know my future after this weekend
And I, and I don't want to
It takes courage to enjoy it
The hardcore and the gentle big-time sensuality, sensuality, oh-oh
It takes courage to enjoy it
The hardcore and the gentle big-time sensuality
It takes courage to enjoy it
The hardcore and the gentle big-time sensuality
