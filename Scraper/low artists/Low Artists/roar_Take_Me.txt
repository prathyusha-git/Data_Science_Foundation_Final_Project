Take the dirt I'm standing on
Take the virgin snow
Take the earth fracked with accounts hacked
And show me where to go
♪
I laid waste at a break-neck pace
I was waging war
I will grind myself like a corpse
It's a habit
Just being dramatic
No reason to panic
Take my blood and ugly lungs
Take my guts out too
Take this flood of empty thoughts
And tell me what to do

I laid waste at a break-neck pace
I was waging war
I will grind myself like a corpse
