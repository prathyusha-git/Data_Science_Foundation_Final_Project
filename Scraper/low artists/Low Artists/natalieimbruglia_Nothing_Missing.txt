Tell yourself a story
There's a mountain to climb
Did you ever stop to consider things
Were always fine?
Some you keep to learn 'em
Some you need to forget
And if it's not alright, you know
It's not over yet
And I feel all eyes on me
But can you deal
With all the pieces of me that you never see?
There's nothing missing here, no
There's nothing missing here
So don't come looking for it
Cause you won't find it anymore
You're looking for something broken
You're looking for someone in fear
But don't come looking here
Cause you won't find it anymore
Won't find it anymore
You know you can't hold him
It's like water in your hands
And it can take a lifetime
Just to understand
And anybody can be anything
But make no mistake
If you tell yourself you're broken
Then you just might break
And I feel all eyes on me
But can you deal
With all this new responsibility?
There's nothing missing here, no
There's nothing missing here
So don't come looking for it
Cause you won't find it anymore
You're looking for something broken
You're looking for someone in fear
But don't come looking here
Cause you won't find it anymore
Fear, fear
Gotta let that pull, just let it flow
And I'll tell myself I know how to do that
It's clear
Cause I'm nearer to the truth these days
But it don't mean a thing if you don't wanna change
There'll be nothing again
There's nothing missing here, no
There's nothing missing here
So don't come looking for it
Cause you won't find it anymore
You're looking for something broken
You're looking for someone in fear
But don't come looking here
Cause you won't find it anymore
Won't find it anymore
Cause you won't find it anymore
But don't come looking here
Cause you won't find it anymore
