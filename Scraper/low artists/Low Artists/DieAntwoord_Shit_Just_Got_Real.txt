Yeah, haha (c'mon)
It's another one of them old funky Cyprus Hill thangs
(Whoa, we got a live one here)
Everybody wanna be a gangster
(So you wanna be a gangster, homes?)
'Til it's time to do gangster shit
('Sup, What you wanna do? Puto make a move)
You talk the talk, you better walk the walk, boy (yeah)
(Put up or shut up)
Shit just got real up in this bitch
(Shit just got real)
Sen Dog, the fucking OG
Bucket hat low, yo I keep it low key
Puffin' yesca, shit smell so sweet
Big weed cloud smoking up your whole street
Cypress Soul Assassins on the creep
Where we come from, yeah, the Vatos roll deep
- Thick homie don't sleep
Sip, sipping light beer, I don't fuck with Olde E
Ease back, you're standing too close homie
What the fuck you want, homes? You don't know me
Jumpin' right at the speed of light, make you go to sleep
Wake up nose bleeding and you got no teeth
Everybody wanna be a gangster
(So you wanna be a gangster, homes?)
'Til it's time to do gangster shit
('Sup? What you wanna do? Puto make a move)
You talk the talk, you better walk the walk, boy (yeah)
(Put up or shut up)
Shit just got real up in this bitch
This one time me and Yolandi was
Driving down the road smoking some herb
Through the fucking streets of Johannesburg
When I'm zef side I always roll strapped
In a matte black Scubie with a matte black gat
Subwoofer in the trunk, kicking to the bass
Now I got this fuckin' .38 stickin in my waist
So I pull out my gat and I leave it on my lap
On the zef side of town now speeding to the left
Stop at the light round the corner from my pad (yeah)
Who's this knocking at my window? (Window)
Nigga pointing at my front wheel says I got a flat
My window's real mother fucking black
So I can see him but he can't see me back
He put a gun on my window and go tap tap tap
So I picked up the matte black gat on my lap
And I said 'Yolandi, can you please lean back?'
Jy, jou ma se poes
Jy's 'n fokken naai
Tsek, jy gat vrek
Ja you gonna die
Wat die fok is aan die gang binne in jou kop?
Fokkol! Bra, jy's 'n fokken flop
Jy's 'n brak
Ek's 'n groot moederfokken hond
Stywe piele, sit dit binne in jou mond
Speak, ma jy kanie
Want daar's 'n piel in jou keel
(Shit just got real)
Everybody wanna be a gangster
(So you wanna be a gangster, homes?)
'Til it's time to do gangster shit
('Sup? What you wanna do? Puto make a move)
You talk the talk, you better walk the walk, boy (yeah)
(Put up or shut up)
Shit just got real up in this bitch
(Shit just got real)
Everybody wanna be a gangster
(So you wanna be a gangster, homes?)
'Til it's time to do gangster shit
('Sup? What you wanna do? Puto make a move)
You talk the talk, you better walk the walk, boy (yeah)
(Put up or shut up)
Shit just got real up in this bitch
