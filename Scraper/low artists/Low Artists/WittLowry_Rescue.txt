Girl, I can't deny I'm feeling butterflies
Looking in your eyes hopefully you're someone I can believe
Yeah see I've been hurt before and I've dealt with the pain
But now I realize I need more, more, more
Could that be, you, who, knew I get these crazy feelings every time I see you
I, promise I'm not drunk see I'm just tryna spill the truth
And girl I know it's been some time but in my life is what I need
You right now, you right now, ima tell you how I feel right now
Can we go back, all the way back, back to when I first made you smile
It's been a while since I've seen your pretty face
Yeah just always know these other girls will never replace
Yeah I'm wasting all my time on all these girls that don't mean nothing
Thinking way back to that summer, oo I knew you felt that something
You can't tell me there was nothing in this crush the longest one I've ever had
I'm looking back like girl you're the best thing that I never had, so
()
Just know, if you ever had your doubts
Or you're feeling down at night I'll pick you right up off the ground
Girl I want you
Should've never made you wait
Just to listen to me say no one has made me feel this way
Girl I want you to know, I want you to know
I want you, I want you, I want you to know
That I want you
Think about you every day I feel it's finally safe to say that you could be the one to rescue
See we've been friends forever
And every time me and my last don't last I'm texting you to feel better
Now I wonder if you see us together
Cause you've been through a hailstorm
I feel like me and you could weather this weather
Yeah, that last line was a subliminal clue
I hope you hear this so you know just how I feel about you
Too scared to tell you how I feel but always wished that you knew
And now I'm stuck here writing songs and all these songs are to prove
Do you ever miss me?
Remember last summer when you kissed me?
Honestly that night was the best
Yeah, but I think we'd agree that night was a mess
You see now at the time I had this friend that really liked you
And was talking to this girl that would do anything to spite you
Due to them, I never made a move
That was my mistake because they showed me what it's like to get walked on and be betrayed
Now I'm sitting on this train just thinking 'bout you and me
So if I fall will you be there to catch me
Please baby don't go
Just know, if you ever had your doubts
Or you're feeling down at night I'll pick you right up off the ground
Girl I want you
Should've never made you wait
Just to listen to me say no one has made me feel this way
Girl I want you to know, I want you to know
I want you, I want you, I want you to know
That I want you
Think about you every day I feel it's finally safe to say that you could be the one to rescue
