Let me tell you about a girl I know
I met her walking down Lowtown Street
Well, she's so fine, well, I wish she was mine
I get shook up every time we meet
I'm talkin' 'bout you, nobody but you
I do mean you now
I'm just trying to get a message to you now
Let me tell you about a girl I know
I tell you now she looked so good
Well, guys stood still at such a beautiful build
She ought to be somewhere in Hollywood
I do mean you now
I'm just trying to get a message to you now
