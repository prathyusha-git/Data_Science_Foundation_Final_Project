One in the spiritual, three in the physical
OG soul like Smokey and the Miracles
Grimy and lyrical—you want it? Here it go
We be in spots where bitch niggas fear to go
Abrasive, still smack faces
Grab you by your neck, smash your head in the basement
Godly, still controllin' the square
You the competition? Get the fuck outta here
We got the safeties and the locks off just in case it jump off
Count to three, only these niggas dump off
For the love of hip-hop, what's it worth?
For the pain of hip-hop, we bringin' the hurt
Fake niggas, we put in the dirt
Silly rap nigga wearin' a skirt
We unbeatable, don't even try
Fuck around, lay around, do or die
It's the militia

Let's see if you can rap and step with this production
I never left, plus I kept me somethin'
That I could use on these MC's that kept frontin'
They watched me unload and explode, I kept dumpin'
The Black Bruno, with the Mack uno uno
Crush you like a Black sumo, I'm back, you know
The man of the hour, I'm the man of the year
Make room and understand I'm here
Hell, my clientele is the most regal
I crush brain cells, my name rings bells to most people
You broke the rules, so I'ma have to get at you
Pussy, you're pitiful, your crew can catch a clip or two
Always the swiftest, you, watch the way I lift his jewels
He's woozy, excuse me while I rip this dude
I light a Dutch while you get touched with ease
And your chick steady fallin' in love with me

Raw
Yo, it's the gang Gang Starr across my chest
On Gu' and them, I never let Solar rest
Me robbin' them rappers that's braggin'
The pain is of Attica stabbin' you
Leakin' from holes you didn't know you was havin'
Bitch niggas take flight when Bump pick up the mic
I write what rappers wanna be like in real life
Then spit your favorite song with verses crazy long
'Cause I do what the fuck I want on every song
And you bitches are mad 'cause you spit a facade
For sad niggas who thought hip-hop was really gone
But not for very long, I'm back to carry on
Like I'm Marshawn Lynch, runnin' through every song
Wack rappers, take a knee, all races
In any race, Freddie Foxxx put that ox to they faces
And fuck your music is the basis
'Cause my shit hard, rip to the gods, say it, militia
