Oh boy
Where have I put my keys
I've looked in my pocket
Behind the newspaper
And underneath the remote control
And I cannot find where I put it again
♪
Oh boy, I cannot find my keys
I'm far too late
The door is open now
A taxi is waiting there
Ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
And a phone keeps ringing
I'm definitely not going to
Pick it up
'Cause
When I grow up
I'm gonna get those fancy key-rings
That you whistle at
And they whistle right back
At you
