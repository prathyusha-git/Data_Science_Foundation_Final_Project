If you ever get close to a human
And human behavior
Be ready, be ready to get confused
There's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic
To human behavior
But yet so, yet so irresistible
And there is no map
They're terribly, terribly, terribly moody
Oh, human behavior
Then all of a sudden turn happy
But, oh, to get involved in the exchange
Of human emotions
Is ever so, ever so satisfying
And there is no map
Human behavior
Human behavior
Human behavior
Human behavior
And there is no map
And a compass wouldn't help at all
Human behavior
Human behavior
Human behavior
Human behavior
There's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic
Human behavior
Human behavior
Human behavior
There's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic
Human
Human
Human
