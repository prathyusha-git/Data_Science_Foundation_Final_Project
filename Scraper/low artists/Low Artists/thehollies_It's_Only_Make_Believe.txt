My one and only prayer
Is that some day you'll care
My hopes, my dreams come true
My one and only you
No one will ever know
How much I love you so
My only prayer will be
Some day you'll care for me
But it's only make believe
My hopes, my dreams come true
My life I give for you
My heart, a wedding ring
My all, my everything
My heart I can't control
You ruin my very soul
My hopes, my prayers, my schemes
You are my everything
But it's only make believe
