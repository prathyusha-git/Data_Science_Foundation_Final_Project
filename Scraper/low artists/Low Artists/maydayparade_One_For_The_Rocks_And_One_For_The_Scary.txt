Tiny little broken thing
What's that I see on your wing?
Is it heavy enough to keep you pinned inside this lucid dream?
I can't remember it well
It must've been for somebody else
We can do anything you wanna do
We can do everything
We'll start right here in this room
Just don't take off too soon

So I soaked it all in kerosene
It was such a pretty thing
Watched it burn for a year 'til I was happy with what I had seen
I don't remember it well
It must've been with somebody else
We can do anything you wanna do
We can do everything
We'll start right here in this room
Just don't get there too soon
♪
So now I'm happy with my eyes closed up so tight
Trying to picture what it looks like when you smile at me that way
With the heaviness and sadness in your eyes (sadness in your eyes)
I should've been prepared for anything
And the ride of my life
♪
Oh, oh oh, oh oh
I should've known to hold tight
We can do anything you wanna do
We can do everything
We'll start right here in this room (we'll start right here in this room)
We can do anything you wanna do (anything you wanna do)
We can do everything (we'll start right here in this room)
We'll start right here in this room (anything you wanna do)
Just don't take off too soon
