We lost our way at the beginning
And some would say it's all upending
We run away and all our days were well
♪
It feels so safe, their arms are waiting
Come here today, they're saving your place
A perfect day behind your eyes when dreaming
Your sleepy head lies on the blanket
Still one more day and let them guide you in
♪
Familiar faces come to see you
A quiet place, your gentle breathing
Let us just lay down in the softer sunset
Go take their hand
They've come to guide you in
