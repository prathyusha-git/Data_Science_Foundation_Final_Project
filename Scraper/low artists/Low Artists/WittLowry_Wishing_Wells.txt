Yeah, when I was younger I wished for girls like you in wishing wells
But now I'm older so my only wish is wish you well
Don't know your worst so love is something that you never felt and
Your parents split so you don't even know if love is real, no
It's Friday night, your local dive got you diving back in
All these other men around all they are are practice
Daddy's money it don't make up for the sense you're lacking
And you tell your friends you're happy but we know you're acting
You don't know why, all you want is emotion
Another night, feeling empty and broken
A couple things you still needing to cope with
You're not alone, just know you're not alone
And you've been feeling hopeless now you're looking back like you own this
Like you own it, own it
And you've been feeling lonely so you're telling me put it on me, put it on me
And you've been sitting at the bar with eleven of your girls
Girl, I know you'll break my heart (break my heart)
Yeah, you've been looking like my ex, leave that ass on read
I might hit her with the XOXO
Don't play, you say you need to change but you don't change
You've been looking for love in this cold place
You talk a lot and I hear more in what you don't say
Talking bout you don't play, acting like you okay
You say you need to change but you don't change
You've been looking for love in this cold place
You talk a lot and I hear more in what you don't say
Talking 'bout you don't play, I don't want it
When I was younger I wished for girls like you in wishing wells
But now I'm older so my only wish is wish you well
I hate to say that I relate, I know the pain is real and
You're feeling numb but me I'm colder than December, feel ya
I put you down like I ain't sitting at the same bar too
I talk about how you're a hoe but I play my part too
The DJ put on something for you to play my heart to
And I've been looking around the room and all I see is you
I don't know how, you still keep your composure
With all the weight that you hold on your shoulders
You're telling me you need me to get closer
You're not alone, to know you're not alone
And you've been feeling hopeless now you're looking back like you own this
Like you own it, own it
And you've been feeling lonely so you're telling me put it on me, put it on me
And you've been sitting at the bar with 11 of your girls
Girl, I know you'll break my heart (break my heart)
Yeah, you've been looking like my ex, leave that ass on read
I might hit her with the XOXO
Don't play, you say you need to change but you don't change
You've been looking for love in this cold place
You talk a lot and I hear more in what you don't say
Talking bout you don't play, acting like you okay
You say you need to change but you don't change
You've been looking for love in this cold place
You talk a lot and I hear more in what you don't say
Talking 'bout you don't play, I don't want it
