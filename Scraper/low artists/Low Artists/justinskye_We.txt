Feel it coming, we just waiting
Heavy topic you run away from it
Weighin' down on my chest, cavin' in
We both can't breathe, and
You just won't leave, and now
Lookin' at you
Weak in your knees, and you're
Laid in your wave of deceit
If you're lookin' down, summer faces
It's all the pain
And it won't go away
We
It's all in agony, yeah
Pray, but my heart is weak, yeah
It's all monotony
But we, we
Both want this to end
'Cause we know we can't go through this again
Just stop hurtin' me
It's all in agony yeah
Pray, but my heart is weak, yeah
It's all monotony now that (we, we)
♪
Took me so long to just say it
Hate to admit our love faded out
All of your silence just screams so loud
It's such a shame that
You just won't change, and you're
Lookin' at me
Going insane 'cause I'm
Trying not to lose all my faith
If you're looking down, what's on my face is
Is all the pain
And it won't go away (and it won't go away)
We
It's all in agony, yeah
Pray, but my heart is weak, yeah
It's all monotony
But we, we
