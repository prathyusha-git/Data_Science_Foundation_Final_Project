Hah
Yeah
You were right, said I'd change and never do
Between you and I, think it hurts because it's true
I can't tell you why I put all the blame on you
Then say, "You decide," what the fuck we're supposed to do?
Hate to see you cry and hate more that I'm to blame
When I realize I'm the one that cause you pain
This is real life and you're tired of the games
And you feel like I may never fucking change
When the highs get high and the lows get low
All I know is you're the one I love
As the tide gets higher and the world's on fire
You're the only one I'm thinking of
Put up wall after wall, was terrified to fall
Instead of leaving, you took time to break through
You have friends that are fam, and fam you can't stand
Guess in blood and in love, we don't choose
You say, "You should try, not just try to win me back"
You disguise all your pain behind your laugh
Been losing sight of the future and the past
Now, who am I? Lately, I've been losing track of who
I wish I could make you love me
I guess so I could feel you hold me
I'm tired, empty, stressed and lonely
Lost on nights like this
The only one I want around me
Can't bear to see your life without me
I'm sorry for the times you found me
Lost on nights like this
Just because we have a heart
Doesn't mean we have a heart
Just because we make mistakes
Doesn't mean that's who we are
Said some shit tonight that I regret
I wanna learn how I can love you best
And just because I hide it well
Doesn't mean it didn't scar
Only time I feel at peace
Is when I lie in your arms
I have angels that I wish you met
And some demons I should keep in check, damn
Can't expect you to save me
I've been lost, haven't talked to my family lately
You know that that ain't me
Just know I love you, have love for the woman that made me
We're under the same stars
And I'm scared you won't love me the same when the day starts
Hate that I play a part
To the hurt in your heart, hear the hurt when you say, "Mark"
You should try, not just try to win me back"
You disguise all your pain behind your laugh
Been losin' sight of the future and the past
Now who am I? Lately, I've been losin' track of who
I wish I could make you love me
Again so I could feel you hold me
I'm tired, empty, stressed and lonely
Lost on nights like this
The only one I want around me
Can't bear to see your life without me
I'm sorry for the times you found me
Lost on nights like this
