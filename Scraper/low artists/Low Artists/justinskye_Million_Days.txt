There isn't many things
That I can say to you, right now
I had to save it for tomorrow
I can't imagine how you feel right now, so I'd
Rather not try
If you had somethin' to say to me
Why don't you try to speak, not walk away from me?
You gotta let me know, right now
'Cause I can't read inside your mind
And I'd rather not try
Love's a risk you take
It's a choice you make
It's so hard to monitor
All the time I get it
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I, I
Don't need advice
Listen to my heart now, babe
I can understand you feel scared
Fightin' all the demons in your way
You gotta get it, you gotta get 'em
And honestly I'm down and out
'Cause I can't figure it out
You know it ain't that hard to get to me
If you wanted you could get to me
Every mornin', 6:00 a.m., I wake up thinkin' of you
Like the time we spent fallin' in love out in Malibu
All the ways you taste
It was nothin' I wanted more than you, understand
Every second that passes by like a million days
And I put too much in it to let it all go to waste
I know you feel the same, don't you?
Love's a risk you take
It's a choice you make
It's so hard to monitor
All the time I get it
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I, I
Don't need advice (Don't need advice)
I know I don't need advice
Love's a risk you take
It's a choice you make (It's a choice you make)
It's so hard to monitor (It's so hard, yeah, it's so hard)
All the time I get it
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I, I (Yeah, yeah)
Don't need advice
No-no-no, I don't
No-no-no, I don't, I don't advice
No-no-no
No, I don't, no-no
No, I don't, no-no
Oh, no-no, no-no
Oh, no-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah, oh-oh
Yeah, I don't advice
Oh, no, I don't, hmm
