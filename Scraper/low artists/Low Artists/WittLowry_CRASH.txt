I know you see the hurt and the pain written on my face
Been thinking 'bout what you think about when you think about me
If everything crashes your eyes are where I feel safe
If all we have left is tonight then I wanted to say
Say no more, but, tell me this (what)
Can you taste the pain in me, on my lips
Question when I saw your face was, who is this?
I was shooting for the stars and was shooting from the hip
Just know that I would never change you
Bless the woman that made you
Bless the people who came around when
You were down and out and then saved you
Fuck the people who played you
Your wall is up I don't blame you
I just want you to know your worth
And to love you the way that God made you
Made you and know
All I wanna do is be there for you through it all
Think about the nights when I would wait up for your call
My ex made me believe you can't trust anyone at all
It's funny how the more you build the farther you can fall
When I had no money we would eat and you would pay
Sorry if you ever felt I ever made you chase
Why you wasting time always staring at your waist?
I just wanna trust you love you more now every day
We're at this diner that we found
Somewhere between then and now
And I ask if you want jam for your toast
You spent the night the other day
So many things I could say
Instead I just shy away and I choke
Uh, and I'm supposed to be a poet
So open with my emotions
And all I can ask about is your toast
I guess I'm glad you didn't leave
'Cause you make me a better me
And you see the Mark no one sees when I'm low, so
I know you see the hurt and the pain written on my face
Been thinking 'bout what you think about when you think about me
If everything crashes your eyes are where I feel safe
If all we have left is tonight then I wanted to say (yeah)
Now after seasons of talking and watching night turn to morning
And telling stories a second time when you feel they're important
The love I have for you is rare I was just scared 'cause it's foreign
That had me thinking should I stop or shoot my shot like I'm Gordon
And still I flashback to the crash that could've ended we
The glass smashed somewhere past that's when you said to me
"You'll be alright", thought if I'm not then I'll pretend to be
I'm thankful every day you found your way and then was lead to me
We're bloody and bruised
Assessing our wounds
Airbag in my face, you can't find your shoes
In shock and I'm sad, in pain and I'm mad
Look down at my stomach, all I'm seeing is black, uh
Lights from the back, they're blue and they're red
The guy who hit us never was found, just left us for dead
A million things I wish I could say, that never were said
I'm sorry if I'm here but not here, got lost in my head
A million things I wish I could do, to show you I care
Just know when you feel empty and scared, I'll always be there
Don't care about how much money you make or clothes that you wear
I care about memories that we make, and time that we share
Let's keep it real
It's hard for me to trust, they all went fake on me
I hope you keep it real and never change on me
You tell me when it's heavy put that weight on me
On me, on me, so
