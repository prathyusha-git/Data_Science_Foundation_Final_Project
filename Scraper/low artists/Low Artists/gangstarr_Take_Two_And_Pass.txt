You better take two and pass, take two and pass
Take two and pass so the blunt will last
Take two and pass so we can all get blunted
Don't smoke cigarettes so my growth ain't stunted
We got at least five heads and I rolled a White Owl
It's the break of dawn and we're awake like night owls
Phillies are cool but they burn much quicker
(Yeah yeah, just pass that blunt nigga)
We lounge to the sounds as we leave from uptown
It's time to go downtown and make some more rounds
The city never sleeps, it's what Sinatra sang
For that phat phat blunt, you know I got this thang
So hand it over 'cause I wanna get charged
I'm in love with Mary Jane, she keeps me large
So don't hog it, let's keep it movin' real fast
And everybody just chill and take like two pulls and pass
I sit and write a rhyme, when I'm done get blunted
I sit and write a rhyme, when I'm done get blunted
You better take two and pass, take two and pass
Take two and pass so the blunt will last
Take two and pass, take two and pass
Take two and pass so the blunt will last
The club is crowded, everyone's up in here
Yo Premier (Yo what's up man?) What's that you got there?
It looks like a nice plump blunt in your hand
I just know you're gonna share it with me 'cause I'm your man
So bust it, I got one too
And if you spark up yours, I'll light up mine when it's through
Oh shit, there goes my man, the fat mack
We used to get blazed, I know he got a fat sack
So let's go upstairs, grab a chair and unwind
And let the la la enhance our minds
The system boomin', let the bass increase
I find a seat so I can peep the chic
Ladies and maybe get my homeboy some ass
So all you gotta do is take like two pulls and pass
I sit and write a rhyme, when I'm done get blunted
I sit and write a rhyme, when I'm done get blunted
Even in the mornin' like the flavor of juice
A blunt adds spice and a blunt can spruce
Up your day, but I'm not advertisin'
Just tellin' of an aspect, a part of our lives and
Around the way there ain't no shame in our game
'Cause the fame is no thang, we get together and hang
And since you know that I got dash and class
Then I'm after you so take like two pulls and pass
I sit and write a rhyme, when I'm done get blunted
I sit and write a rhyme, when I'm done get blunted
Get blunted, get blunted, get blunted, get blunted
Get blunted, get blunted, get blunted, get blunted
Get blunted, get blunted, get blunted, get blunted
Get blunted, get blunted, get blunted, get blunted
