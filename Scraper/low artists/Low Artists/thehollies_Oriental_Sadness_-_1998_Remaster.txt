The Hollies
Oriental Sadness
(L. Ransford = Allan Clarke, Tony Hicks & Graham Nash)
Track 5 on album 'Would You Believe' June 1966
{Oriental sounding guitar intro}
How soon tears begin to tumble
from her laughing eyes.
She's been talking to somebody
who told her lies (she'll never trust in anybody no more)
Who told her lies (she'll never trust in anybody no more).
How can I begin to reach her,
let her know the truth.
What that someone has been saying
is only lies (she'll never trust in anybody no more)
It's only lies (she'll never trust in anybody no more).
How could she think that I
would take advantage of a girl like her.
How could she think that I
Would sacrifice all I have felt for her
Would sacrifice all I have felt for her.
{Oriental sounding guitar interlude}
Like a flower she is fading,
soon she'll wilt and die.
If she doesn't get the sunlight
that I can give (she'll never trust in anybody no more)
That I can give (she'll never trust in anybody no more).
How could she think that I
would take advantage of a girl like her.
How could she think that I
Would sacrifice all I have felt for her
Would sacrifice all I have felt for her.
Like a flower she is fading,
soon she'll wilt and die.
If she doesn't get the sunlight
that I can give (she'll never trust in anybody no more)
That I can give (she'll never trust in anybody no more).
