Poc, poc, poc, poc, poc, poc, poc (Senta no pocotó)
Poc, poc, poc, poc, poc, poc, poc (Senta no pocotó)
I just wanna make it home, got on my Air Vision Pros
I killed my own default mode (Vou te dar um tal de trepa)
Ela quica no— ela quica no—
Ela quica no upa-upa, ela senta no pocotó, upa-upa, pocotó
Trepa no— trepa no— trepa no— trepa no— trepa no—
Trepa no— trepa no— trepa no— trepa no— trepa no— trepa no—
Fica de quatro, nós bota sem dó
Ela quica no— ela quica no—
Ela quica no upa-upa, ela senta no pocotó, upa-upa, pocotó
Ela quica no— ela quica no—
Ela quica no upa-upa, ela senta no pocot— pocot— pocot— pocot— pocot—
This hoe told me I'm a dawg, but all my bitches say
"I can't even fake this shit, I can't be no basic bitch"
On my knees in front of God, but I'm not even fazed
I can keep no secrets, baby don't even speak it
Walk in that bitch, ayy, stick a fork in that bitch, ayy
I'm lit, I'm not gonna lie, the switch cheaper than wine
My hips be keeping the fire, your misses be missin' my lies
I switched from suit to goth to a dime
The wrist do flips to keep her enticed
This hoe told me I'm a dawg, but all my bitches say
"I can't even fake this shit, I can't be no basic bitch"
On my knees in front of God, but I'm not even fazed
I can keep no secrets, baby don't even speak it
Bruh, I cannot take niggas fakin' like this
They never met me, but be on my dick
How you don't care, but you got an—
How you don't care, but you got an opinion?
Smoking your fav', like I'm takin' a swig
Hating for free but you can't pay your rent
If you're gonna dick-ride, make it make cents
If you just gone wave bye, don't diss then
I can count all my industry friends on my hands
And my niggas, they be in demand
Private school rappers don't know what it is
If I show you a Drac', I ain't playin' with kids
You niggas loop it and leave it, I'm never repeatin'
That bullshit ain't worth leaking (Fica de quatro, nós bota sem dó)
Hit the deck
These niggas hit the deck (I hit the deck)
Ain't on shit
These niggas ain't on shit (They ain't on shit)
Fuck that bitch
I'ma say fuck that bitch (Ayy, fuck that bitch)
Too cold at this
I'm too cold at this
Real niggas do real things
Hoes wanna fuck on a nigga for some change
Anybody try me, I'ma make a stain
Anybody try me, I'ma make a stain
Vapo, vapo, vapo, vapo, vapo, vapo, vapo, vapo
Vapo, vapo, vapo, vapo, vapo, vapo, vapo
Ela quica no— ela quica no—Ela quica no upa-upa, ela senta no pocot—
Pocot— pocot— (Ha! Mais uma do RaMeMes)
Ela quica no— ela quica no—
Ela quica no upa-upa, ela senta no pocot— pocot— pocot— pocot— pocot—
Pocot— pocot— pocot— pocot— pocot— pocot— pocot— pocot—
Pocot— pocot— pocot— pocot— pocot— pocot— pocot— pocot—
Pocot— pocot— pocot— pocot— pocot— pocot— pocot— pocot—
