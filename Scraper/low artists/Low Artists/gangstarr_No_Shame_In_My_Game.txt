Yo, this is your host with the most, the grand high exalted
Never faulted, known as Guru stickin' it to you
And this your co-host with the co-most
The mystic majestic left-right-left kid
Jeru the Damaja
Ayo, son
Yo, what's up, son?
I heard some crabs all in it
Talkin' about how you drink 40's and this and this and that
What?
Tell me what you feel about that
Yeah, whatever, whatever
Ayo, Premier, speed up this track and I'ma drop the latest facts
As I deliver rhymes with ease and walk around with my head up
I'm dead up serious so don't be gettin' too curious
Motherfuckers always wanna know what makes me tick
I pull a phrase out quick 'cause I'm dipped and I'm slick
You thought that I would slip 'cause you seen me drinkin' 40's
It shocked you, then you told your friends you saw me
Well, say what you want 'cause all of mine is intact
In fact, I'll have you open like a hooker's gap
I like to catch a buzz 'cause I get into the beats more
MC's are washed up like dead fish on a seashore
Save the talk, 'cause you know I walk that walk
Hittin' city to city but make my home in New York
I know the time with this rap shit 'cause they got it all backwards
They need to take a hint or catch my microphone imprint
Straight to the dome through the skull to the tissue
Call me Guru, I'll diss you if you're pressin' the issue
Not my style to be sweatin' all the stupid-ass rumors
I'll take it as a compliment and fuck you too
If you're schemin' on a chance to put a stain on my name
Don't even think about it 'cause ain't no shame in my game
The shame in my game
The, the, the, the shame in my game
The, the, the, the shame in
The shame in, the shame in, the shame in my game
The, the, the, the, the shame in my game
The, the, the, the shame in my game
The, the, the, the shame in my
The shame in my, the, the, the shame in my, my, my, my game
Stick to the subject, I ain't afraid to be real
A lot of MC's fake hard just to gain appeal
I like some gangster rap, don't like the prankster crap
So I get past all that by kickin' straight up facts
There ain't no reason to shoot unless you got beef
If you pull out and you don't use it then you may catch grief
Toolies and TECs ain't toys but kids got 'em today
If they're ready to spray, best get the fuck out the way
I try keepin' my sanity by thinkin' of better times
If I write clever rhymes then maybe I'll climb
But what the hell's success if the mess ain't changin'?
5-0'S still corrupt, stupid gangs still bangin'
Stick-up kids still stickin', nasty hookers still trickin'
All the pimps still pimpin' and all the crackheads trippin'
While the dealers still sellin' so I'll refrain from the yellin'
And the preachin', 'cause who the fuck would I reach?
Man, niggas don't wanna starve that, they wanna live fat
Who'd wanna clean up their act when the papes come in stacks?
They live for the minute and they're all wrapped up in it
It's an unfortunate state, for many it's too late
Now death stalks the streets and it's right at your gate
So buck, lose your mind, but I ain't goin' insane
I kick the fly lyrics 'cause ain't no shame in my game
The, the, the, the, the, the, the, the shame in my game
The, the, the, the shame in my game
The, the, the shame in my, the shame in my
The shame in my, my, my, my game
Life's a bitch, so who are we to judge each other?
I know I got faults, I ain't the only motherfucker
Stuff I heard about you wasn't too cool, you know
Like how you smoke woolies and that your girl's a ho
But I don't listen to shit unless the story's legit
And knuckleheads need to quit 'cause they be ridin' the dilsnick
But I'm takin' care of business regardless
And when it comes to rhymin', you know I'm hittin' hardest
So you can kick dirt but in the end you'll feel pain
You little sucker, there ain't no shame in my game
The shame in my game
The, the, the, the shame in my game
The, the, the, the, the shame in my, my
The shame in my, my, the shame in my, my, my, my, my game
My, my, my, my, my, my game
My, my, my, my game
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my game
