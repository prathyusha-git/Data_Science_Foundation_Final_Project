Freak bitch, tuck it in her tan line
No stripes, made her talk to me like I got gang ties
Straight right catching his heater, feel like a landmine
2025, your politics is a gang sign
Ow!, let's go
They bullshittin' but spittin' like they was Esco
Take it off, bitch bend your knees and protect the cross
Two faced, and I'm Harvey Dent mixed with Michael Jackson
I can't even get jiggy with these niggas, I feel like Michael Blackson
And y'all got 30 niggas on a beat, that shit is Frankenstein
I'm outstreamin' every nigga I beef with, I be analyzing
Ah! Let's go
Aye, fuck your writtens, you bombin' like Charlie Hebdo
Take it off, just bend your knees and protect the cross
I can't treat no skeeze like no main squeeze
She don't even ask me who I hang with, she know I cheat
These bitches don't even speak my language, I'm finna leave
'Cause Peggy is not for your entertainment, I need a fee
Uh, retro
They assed out, we banged his BM like Kirko
Peak the lore, she shakin' ass on podium floors
(Careful, careful) damn
You can just relax (thi-thi-thi-this, this, this generation)
Every other day I turn these beats into a pack
Call me black Kenny Rogers, 'cause I know when to fold 'em
Cashin' out 'cause it's too late in the stage to be spittin' cap, bitch
I can't stand the way you crackers copy (thi-thi-thi-this)
Feet on land, you'd never hit a nazi
Frito shoulder, I'm marrying the chip
Real hares had her bunny hoppin' on a dick
Freak bitch, tuck it in her tan line
No stripes, made her talk to me like I got gang ties
Straight right catching his heater, feel like a landmine
2025, your politics is a gang sign
Ow! Let's go
They bullshittin' but spittin' like they was Esco
Take it off, just bend your knees and protect the cross
Thi-thi-thi-this, this, this generation
Huh
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Ooh, ooh
I come through swiftly, don't beef with a nigga, I'll do fifty, uh (ooh)
Op list don't trip me, I aim when I'm rollin' like wheelchair Jimmy (huh)
Why did you say you was gon' fuck me up last year? Now I do not hear a peep (huh)
Probably because you know next time I see you, you gonna end up right next to Peep (bitch)
Crackers be thinkin' that all of my lines about what they projectin' on me (on me)
'Cause they'd rather focus on hatin' on Peggy than gettin' some pussy or cheese
All you cosplay white-boy rappin' ass niggas can suck on a D-
I do not do back and forth with a cracker, I'm crackin' my whip on the beat (uh)
I cannot study no parts like an actor, I gotta freestyle what I'm makin' (I'm makin')
I cannot act like I don't want the crown, don't care if it's taken or vacant
Man, these niggas be old and not wise
I meant all of that rippidy rappin' be makin' me soft
All of them Wah Gwan Delilahs, they standin' on nothin'
Them niggas and hoes can be bought
White bitches ain't vote for Kamala, they lie
So I lie when I'm tryna to get in that box
Bitch, get on your knees, shake that ass and get to protectin' my cross
