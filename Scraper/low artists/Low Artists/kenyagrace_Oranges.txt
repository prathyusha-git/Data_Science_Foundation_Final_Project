Our conversations always end up in a mess
We're mid-argument before I'm even dressed
And I wish I could quit you, but I'm drawn into your net
I love you, but I hate you
You're like smoking cigarettes
It's all day, it's all night
We're fighting every second, but I miss you all the time
It's okay, we're fine
Yes, I make excuses 'cause you're toxic and you're mine
(Fighting every second, but I miss you all the time)
(Yes, I make excuses 'cause you're toxic and you're mine)
I always said our fighting was only a dumb phase
You say we're good together, but you're lying to my face
And when it's bad I want you more as I call time to game
But I, I love to play
It's all day, it's all night
We're fighting every second, but I miss you all the time
It's okay, we're fine
Yes, I make excuses 'cause you're toxic and you're mine
(Fighting every second, but I miss you all the time)
(Yes, I make excuses 'cause you're toxic and you're mine)
It's all day, it's all night
We're fighting every second, but I miss you all the time
It's okay, we're fine
Yes, I make excuses 'cause you're toxic and you're mine
(Toxic and you're mine)
(Toxic and you're mine)
(Toxic and you're mine)
(Toxic and you're mine)
