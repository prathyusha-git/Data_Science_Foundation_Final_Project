Time is passin'
And I'm waitin' here on my own, hmm
There's certain things
That I just don't need to know
I feel you changin' in front of me
And I don't wanna believe it
I'll close my eyes and I'll go to sleep
Oh, can't hurt if you never see it
Tell me sweet white lies
Just so I can sleep tonight
If you're not coming home
Just keep it to yourself, oh
I don't want to know, know, know
Yeah, I don't wanna believe it
Don't want to know, know, know
Yeah, baby don't tell a soul
'Cause I don't wanna know
Save your lyin', baby
Please, just don't tell the truth, oh, no
Just let me live in peace
It's all that I ask of you
I feel you changin' in front of me (uhm, hmm)
And I don't wanna believe it
I'll close my eyes and I'll go to sleep
Oh, can't hurt if you never see it
Tell me sweet white lies
Just so I can sleep tonight
If you're not coming home
Just keep it to yourself, oh
I don't want to know, know, know (I don't want to, baby, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I don't wanna believe it
Don't want to know, know, know
Yeah, baby don't tell a soul
'Cause I don't wanna know
♪
Yeah, I don't wanna know
