When did it happen? The fighting
Now we're never trying
And it wasn't always like this
We were happy, do you miss it?
I know that you hate my guts
I think there's something wrong with us
Baby, it's always the same old thing
I'll say we're done, you'll say you hate me
You'll throw your phone right on the concrete
You're half out the door, calling me crazy
I hear myself say
"Can't you just stay?"
Mm-mm
Can't you just stay? Ah-ahh
Why can't I leave? It's the right thing
I always threaten, but I'm lying
'Cause every time that I try to
I just come right back to you
And you know that I hate your guts
I think there's something wrong with us
'Cause, baby, it's always the same old thing
I'll say we're done, you'll say you hate me
You'll throw your phone right on the concrete
You're half out the door, calling me crazy
I hear myself say
"Can't you just stay?"
Mm-mm
Can't you just stay? Ah-ahh
Can't you just stay? Mm-mm
Can't you just stay? Ah-ahh
I know that you hate my guts
I think there's something wrong with us
Baby, it's always the same old thing
♪
It's always the same
Can't you just stay? Mm-mm
Can't you just stay?
I'll say we're done, you'll say you hate me
