Brazen in our prime, tie up a phone line
America Online, blindsided decline
Guess we missed every sign
Were we dead the entire time?
Obvious to anyone else, but nothing we could see
Obvious to anyone else, but nothing we could see
Whether by free will or whether by fate
Sometimes the thing that you see is just cake
Humbled and blessed in the face of evidence
"Tell it like it is!" cries out the audience
Obvious to anyone else, but nothing we could see
Obvious to anyone else, but nothing we could see
