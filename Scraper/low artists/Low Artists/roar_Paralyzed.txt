Use windows like they're mirrors
Like they're mirrors
Soon a face will appear
Will appear
You've made it a career
Up from here
You're a prisoner here
Prisoner here
Lonely and paralyzed by fear
Like every single time, you hoped you'd disappear
Lonely and paralyzed by fear
Like every single time, you hoped you'd disappear
Lonely and paralyzеd by fear
Like evеry single time, you hoped you'd disappear
Lonely and paralyzed by fear
Like every single time, you hoped you'd disappear
I'm not gonna help you
I'm not gonna save you
But you won't let me be
You won't let me be
I'm not gonna help you
I'm not gonna save you
But you won't let me be
You won't let me be
