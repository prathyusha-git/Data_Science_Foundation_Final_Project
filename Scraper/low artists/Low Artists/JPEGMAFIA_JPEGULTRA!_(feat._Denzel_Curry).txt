(You think you know me)
Out the trenches for you flabbergasted fat fucks
This your boy, Denzel Curry in this bitch
And I'm chillin' with my nigga, Peggy
You already know what time it is, we goin' around the world with it
And inside your girl with it, you feel me?
Live out of your bitch body like my nigga Wang Zhi
And you know for Pete's sake
Nigga, the boy Denzel Curry gotta do what it take
To get that motherfuckin' money and that motherfuckin' bread
To get it all on your bitch head, you dig?
So, this how we gon' do it
Okay, so I gotta be rude
No matter which way you go, you'll still be a square like a Rubik's Cube
Zeltron, nigga, I am that dude
Me and J-P goin' A-P-E, so I got monkey bars, but this ain't PE
Everybody said I got ADD, but it never add up, I'ma count past three
Matter of fact, one
All of this devilish shit from D to MC, but it's guaranteed to make a rev run
Knee-high jump, better get far, or it's T I stomp
South Florida nigga but I'm North Dade, nigga
This year, I'ma be a too-paid nigga
Knockin' off the top, that's a toupee, nigga
I'm a tsunami, the new wave, nigga
Most of your members will be dismembered
When you fall off, bitch, I'm yellin' out, "Timber"
You couldn't fuck with me if I had Tinder
Last name Curry and the C for charisma
Somebody from Street Fighter 6 on my neck
But you niggas never do it like this
Got a brand new all-gold shin, Akuma hangin' from my neck to my dick
Live and direct out your bitch pussy
This your boy Denzel Curry in this ho
A.K.A. Zeltron, A.K.A. Big Ultra
Y'all niggas don't know what the fuck it is
When a real nigga step into a room with some alligator shoes on
'Cause you know we straight out the swamp, straight out the Everglades
Out of Florida, bitch-ass nigga
You feel me? Dade County, Get Sprayed County
Lauderdale or Slaughterdale
You already know what the fuck it is
Ay, Peggy, let me talk to 'em one time, hold up
Niggas be beggin' for shit to be different until they get it, then they treat it indifferent
People projectin' they bullshit at you 'cause they dissatisfied with the life that they living
Niggas' net worth be like 17 bucks while they begging for feet pics from shorties I been in
I can sniff out you proximity hoes, always near some shit going on, but never did it
I don't understand when people talk shit on me, they gotta lead with a lie or some fibbing
Friends acting like they don't wanna talk, then start begging for change, I don't know what it's giving
Niggas be tryin' to fuck on your bitch while they dappin' you up sayin', "I see your vision"
Fake friends turning on me for nothing, they mad 'cause they failed even with an advantage
This is my fight, I just woke up as a child of the light
Jumped on the beat, had to tell it, "Goodnight"
Y'all tried your best but the heat aimin' right
Kimber OG, I'm as high as a kite
Shop for success, well, I brought me a pint
Watch how I whip, I ain't stir-fry the rice
Get your head cracked just for rollin' the dice, uh
Now don't believe hype
Believe what you see, not what's said on the mic
Peggy Chun-Li, I kick out every time
Can't keep me down, so they try block the shine
Try fuck with my money, try fuck with my mind
Then acting like fucking they bitch is a crime
This ain't relatable, this ain't debatable
Somethin' happened to you, it's by design, shh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, man
JPEG motherfuckin' MAFIA
Makin' grown men emotional since 2008, at least
Now, walk around everywhere as me, you know
And you never catch me out here lookin' like these dirty-ass underground rappers
Locked in the Airbnb somewhere with a bunch of niggas, playin' with each other's dicks
Zero women around, loopin' records nobody wants to hear
Uh, look
On my knees for a God who can hear
I can't pray to no God I can't fear
I think I should have ran me a cult
Quarterback that ho like I'm Peyton on Colts
Fuck-niggas yappin' 'bout me on they alt
But when I see you, it's degrees of assault
You said you see him, you catching a case?
I hope not like the one you got in your vault
'Cause that shit is shaky
Heard the church service said, "Come as you are"
So I showed up with a whole bunch of bitches that hate me
Told my main bitch to stop actin' expensive
Girl, pass me the mic, you as clueless as Stacy
I know that time heals wounds, but my time is money and I can't use time as saline
Pray, for all of my enemies, they either dead or hating, literally faking
Lame-ass niggas get exposed every day, and I don't gotta do nothing more than frustrate him
He's not a threat, bitch, I'm on him, a vet
I had marksman in basic, I never need training
Ay, they make a career from hating
Ay, they make a career from faking
I shit-talked my way right into a bag
You pussy in private, beg him for collabs
You pillow-talkin' to these bitches, it's sad
I don't know whether to slap you or laugh
Shower posse, give that baby a bath
I know your label saw a cash grab
You got popped then turned hashtag
Stop yappin' online 'cause you know where I'm at, lil' bitch
Fuck nigga
