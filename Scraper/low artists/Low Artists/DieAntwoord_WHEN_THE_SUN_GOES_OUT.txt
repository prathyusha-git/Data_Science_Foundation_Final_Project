I'm not really sure what insanity is to tell you the truth
So sometimes I feel I'm going in a path
It's going against the river
Going against the wave, going against what other people are doing
But I don't necessarily call that insanity
I really don't call that insanity
Sometimes when I look at the mass of people or turn on the TV
I just shake my head and say:
This is insanity
This is insanity
Normality is insanity
I can't escape it, it's everywhere
Wherever I look it's there
So I'm not quite clear on what the word means anymore
Of course, I'm afraid of dying, everybody is.
Everything on the planet is afraid of dying, whether it's a dog
Whether it's a mosquito, whether it's a turtle
Whether it's a cat, everything's programmed to survive
Everything doesn't want to... nothing wants to die
Everything's struggling to live
I guess humans, but I wouldn't necessarily say this for certain
Are maybe most aware of the fact that they're going to die
And I guess that makes the whole
Journey a lot more difficult, more complex
And more challenging than perhaps what goes through
An animal's mind, but I wouldn't say that for certain
Well, you know
I'm certain, certain people who came into contact with me
During my life will remember me, there is no doubt about it
And as time goes on less and less people might remember me, unless
What I've what achieved in my art
Has some sort of eternal meaning to it
It's always impossible to judge whether this will happen
Or not happen, it's... it's...
Whether it's just chance I guess
Maybe skill, maybe chance, whatever it is that you have
Uh... a following that goes beyond your own life
But ultimately I guess
They say everything will disappear
And I guess the planet might disappear
When the sun goes out
