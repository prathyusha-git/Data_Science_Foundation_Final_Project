My throat was stunned
My mouth was sewn up
Banned from making noise
♪
I was not heard
♪
All calmly
♪
Remove this hindrance
My throat feels stuck
I was not allowed
I was not heard
♪
I was not heard
I was not heard
I was not heard
There is vocal sadness
I was separated
From what I can do
What I'm capable of
Need to break off
Vicious habits
Do something I haven't done
I haven't done before
♪
In vow of silence
I'll explore the negative space
Around my mouth
It implodes
Black hole
With jaw fallen in
In fallen jaw
Jaw fallen in
I am not hurt
I am not hurt
This tunnel has enabled
Thousands of sounds
I thank this trunk
Noise pipe, noise pipe
♪
I have followed a path
That took sacrifices
Now I sacrifice this scar
Can you cut it off?
