O I would die for this feeling
Give all my soul for this deadly feeling of love
Now I feel that the day has come
The day has come
You're calling me across the beautiful sky
My heart is crashing against the rocks
Responding fiercely as I face your dark eyes
I walk to you, I swear I have wings
I was flying the magical day we fell in love
Two hearts unchained
Flying...
