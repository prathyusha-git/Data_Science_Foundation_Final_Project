Yeah
Fuck that, woah
Uh, fuck that bitch I changed the plan
Switch my style like I switch hands
Block the witness take the stand
Fuck out the way bitch back it up
Shit better get played in a palace (word)
I can't treat niggas like big deals
Why put up a front I'm callous
Bald (ha)
I look like Ray Allen (real)
These niggas make beats on big wheels
Your files is not a challenge (nah)
Boy you can't rap for shit
Shuttlesworth blessed me with talent
Hairline proof God needs balance
Bald
(I'm makin' waves, bro)
Uh, look I'm cashing out
Young Darby I'm tagging in
They gon' bring your casket out
I hope that you fit in it
Ooh, what you doing? Yeah
How you get caught with no gat?
You niggas must got no pride
Peggy gon' give you no slack fo' real
'Cause you pussy
♪
Woah, woah, woah
Keep my business off the 'Gram
Switch my style like I switch hands
Going to war on foreign land
Fuck out the way bitch back it up
Shit better get played in a palace
Wait
Uh, I can't treat niggas like big deals
These toys don't come with no kids meal
Been there done that done seen it
Not my girl but I fuck her like she is
They be fucking up my lyrics on Genius
And these pussy ass critics repeat it
Been the same since Even Stevens
Y'all niggas switch with like the seasons
Y'all lives ain't got no meaning
And them deals ain't got no freedom
I can't just loop it and leave it
Gotta smack it up, rip it up and eat it (yeah, ha)
You can't feed your kid 'cause you spent that shit on your car (you broke)
Tape my hands I'm going over squares heads like a VCR (ha)
