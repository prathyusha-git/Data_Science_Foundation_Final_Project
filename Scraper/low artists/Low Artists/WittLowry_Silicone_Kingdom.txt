Here's mom and dad yelling
Mom always want a divorce
Dad calling mama a whore
Drunk, been drinking all weekend
A couple of coors
A couple of doors are broken
Covered the floor, damn
So he's told never to tell
If anybody finds out
He'll be put in a cell
Hit with a belt
There will be nobody to help
And so he prays every day
While he's stuck in this hell
All to himself
He holds every ounce of it in
All the kids who have things
Always laughing at him
All the teacher sees is pain
But he's playing pretend
Playing with friends is something
He wishes he can
But, nobody wants to give him a chance
Nobody wants to be with a man
Been looking in the future
But the future is so far in advance
Looking at the alcohol in his hand
Like damn, like why
Why god
Why do I do this again
And, why am I getting so drunk
See my dad was a drunk
I don't wanna be him
I, I know im searching for feelings
I thought I could find them in bottles of gin
I'm tired of losing my faith
And then looking to fake to replace all my feelings within I
I don't wanna lose myself, lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
Just to ruin, a silicone kingdom with you, with you
I don't wanna lose myself, lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
Just to ruin, a silicone kingdom with you, with you
She goes to read another message
Hoe, slut, stupid, and fake
She doesnt know how much she can take
She lookin at her body
Its her body that's she plans to replace
Fake, everything all over her face
It's fake, smile, leads up to her lashes
Never been askes about passion
Only been asked about passin the blunt to the left
Or a pick of a chest called him bitch and a mess
She's a wreck
Waitin for a text from a guy
He'd tell her that he love her but he wanna see her cry
He'd tell her that he love her but he beat her every night, with a pipe
That despite she might leave him for a guy with a tie and a job
A mike or a rob
She tired and sobs on the knob of a door
Yelling out "Please I can't take no more"
And he's yelling out "Fuck you, you cunt you whore"
Damn, she doesnt wanna be on the news
Only twenty two looking down the barrel of a 22
Looking for a move she can make
Looking at the bruise on her face
Never felt safe
Never felt late 'till the end of the month
Looking down at her stomach
Like what have we done
I was looking for love
And you were looking for fun
And now a life is in my body cause you wanted to cum
Like why, why god
Why do I do this again
And, why am I thinking that we can can find love inside lust
And we love to pretend
I, I know I'm searching for feelings
I thought I could find them by fucking with him
I'm tired of losing my faith
And then looking to fake to replace all my feelings within I
I don't wanna lose myself, lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
Just to ruin, a silicone kingdom with you, with you
I don't wanna lose myself, lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
Just to ruin, a silicone kingdom with you, with you
He's addicted to the worlds most dangerous drug
Don't wanna make you lose everything that you love
And we don't understand
Money doesn't buy love
So we pile up all our money just to buy
Some new cars, some new rims, a new binz
He doesn't have friends no more
An Ipod, an Ipad, an Imac
So rich that he's feeling poor
If he had one chance to go back
Wishes that he never bagged a whore
A couple more coors and a broken door
Shatter the coor all over the floor
Coming home at a quarter to four
Coming home is a bore
Looking at a gin bottle
Got a quarter to pour
At a local titty bar
I got a better a pour
No cover ones cover the floor
Really looking for more
And more money makes more problems
He don't understand how to solve them
Doesn't understand his son and his wife or his life
Every night when they fight
Now he's looking at 'em as a problem
That's a problem
Now he doesn't know what to do
Out of touch leaving ten every weekend or two
Thinking money maybe buys all the happiness too
'Till hes sitting in a room staring back at a 22
Like, what happened to life
It was so many years and I thought I was right
It was so many years never living my life
And im scared that my son turnes just like, me
Why me, my god
Everything I see really is a facáde
Fake love, fake hair, fake bills, fake, bi
We replace as a race and we try to play god
Like why, why god
Why do I do this again
And why am I getting so drunk
See my dad was a drunk I don't wanna be him
I, I know I'm searching for feelings
I thought I could find them in bottles of gin
I, I know we're thinkin' that we can find love inside lust and we love to pretend
I, I know I'm part of the problem a silicone kingdom we're living within
I'm tired of losing my faith
And then looking in fake to raplace all my feelings within I
I don't wanna lose myself, lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
Just to ruin, a silicone kingdom with you, with you
I don't wanna lose myself, lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
Just to ruin, a silicone kingdom with you, with you
