The Hollies
Lullaby To Tim
(Allan Clarke/Tony Hicks/Graham Nash)
Track 4 on album 'Evolution' june 1967
{Graham Nash sings 'bubbly' lead vocals}
Would you like to slide down a rainbow?
Catch a falling star in your hands?
Chase a moonbeam right by your window?
Close your eyes, and you'll be there.
In a land of dragons and castles,
be a knight in armor that shines,
on a horse with trappings of silver.
Close your eyes, and you'll be there.
You will be there.
Hoping that no one will come and wake you up.
You will be there.
While the mooning is peeping,
as you lie a-sleeping
in your dreamworld.
{interlude}
You will be there.
Hoping that no one will come and wake you up.
You will be there.
While the mooning is peeping,
as you lie a-sleeping
in your dreamworld.
See the witches fly on their broomsticks,
stirring cauldrons, casting their spells.
Kisses changing frogs into princes.
Close your eyes, and you'll be -
close your eyes, and you'll be -
close your eyes, and you'll be there.
