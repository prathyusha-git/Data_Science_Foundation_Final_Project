The summer war is upon us now
We'll have to take our things and go
End is coming to take us home, alright
♪
Watch the buildings coming down
Nothing's coming to save us now
Bring the horror to the front tonight
♪
Devil's arming to the teeth
Come the phantom time to reap
Pray the Lord your soul to keep you now
♪
Ah the ground, it's falling out
Summer shadow takes control
Let it go 'cause nothing matters now
♪
Watch the buildings coming down
Nothing's coming to save us now
Heaven's coming to take us home, alright
♪
The summer war is upon us now
We'll have to take our things and go
All the heavens falling down tonight
