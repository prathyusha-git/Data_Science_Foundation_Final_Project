One day left on earth
You were in my dream
And you told me that a meteor was heading straight for me
You said I've got a week to make sure I know who to see
If we had one day left on earth, would you call me? Would you call me?
And in our last few moments left, would you want me? Would you want me?
If we had one day left on earth, would you call me? Would you call me?
And in our last few moments left, would you want me? Would you want me?
Would you want me?
Would you want me?
Would you want me?
Would you want me?
Would you want me?
It's only complete
The world wouldn't feel finished without you next to me
You said I've got a week
And if I think about it too much, then I forget to breathe
I see faces in places, mean nothing to me
When everything is over, I know where I'll be
But in the last second, I call your phone and I got nothing
If we had one day left on earth, would you call me? Would you call me?
And in our last few moments left, would you want me? Would you want me?
If we had one day left on earth, would you call me? Would you call me?
And in our last few moments left, would you want me? Would you want me?
Would you want me?
Would you want me?
Would you want me?
Would you want me?
In the end, it falls apart, I won't be scared if you're here with me
Here with me
In the end, it falls apart, I won't be scared if you're here with me
