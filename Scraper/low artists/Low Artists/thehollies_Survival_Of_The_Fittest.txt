The Hollies
Survival Of The Fittest
(Allan Clarke/Tony Hicks/Graham Nash)
Track 1 on album 'Confessions For The Mind' november 1970
Give her a hand 'cos she gave a good show
Her makeup was right for the occasion
She did what she had to do, she said what she had to say
She played her part to perfection
She's so empty inside, lies to herself and the public
She's so empty inside, lies to herself and the public
acclaim's not the same
such a shame
The star of the show she was true to herself
and everything went as reported
Rumours about herself came along
That's when it all got distorted
She's so empty inside, lies to herself and the public
She's so empty inside, lies to herself and the public
acclaim's not the same
such a shame
What a good show she gave
Happy to go on the stage
Was she to know it would change
Can she go on feeling strange
She's so empty inside, lies to herself and the public
She's so empty inside, lies to herself and the public
acclaim's not the same
such a shame
