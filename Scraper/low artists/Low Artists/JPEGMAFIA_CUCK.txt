Scary
Real fuckin' scary
Safe, safe, safe, safe
Safe, safe, safe, safe, safe, safe
Scary, scary
Fuckin' scary
Safe, safe, safe, uh
Uh, white boy, antichrist
See my skin while I fuck your wife
Cuckold, she oh, so sexy, she a nympho
I get her all type of ways
Combination, she ain't never safe
Long stroke, backstroke
She throw it back, I handle those
Big ol' dick, good credit
Nice car, yeah, I said it
Fuck all your rules, nigga
Stick together like Jews, nigga
Momma never raised a fool, nigga
You can't play me like a coon, nigga
I prey in your insecurities
'Cause you ain't as pure as you make it appear to be
Cracker, you shakin' my hand but you know you an actor
You been preachin' to the pastor
Boy, I should blow up your FASFA
All on my dick 'cause you fear I'm a factor
You whippin' a Prius, I'm whippin' your ass
I show up in class and murder your masters
I think that y'all need some help (help)
Blow your brains on the pavement, now think for yourself
Bitch, I got a gun on my shelf
Bitch, who you gon' run and go tell?
Bitch, I got you figured out
You should go look in the mirror now
Safe, safe, safe, safe, safe
You ain't never safe
Safe, safe, safe, safe, safe
You ain't never safe
You ain't never safe (bitch)
You ain't never safe (bitch)
You ain't never safe, bitch
You ain't never safe
White, white, white, white, white
White, white, white, white, white (uh)
Fucking scary
Oh my fucking God
Gotta pray to Allah, gotta grab my Quran
I've been here for nine fucking months
And I just gotta go, I can't get what I want
