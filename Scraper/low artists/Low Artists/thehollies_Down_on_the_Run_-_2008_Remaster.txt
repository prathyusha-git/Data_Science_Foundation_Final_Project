It's late
And the weekend's near
You could say I can't wait
'Till the gang gets here
Eight
And the Angels are roaring
Shining those dips
Straight line for the strip
If I back out
Fake a black out
At my night on the chicken run
Need some moonshine
Doctor goodtime
Keeping my nerves in line
Down on the run
Cy
The pack leader's wild
Even preaches to ride
In a Brando style
Fast
Two shadows are closing
Passing like knives
Short cut on our lives
If I back out
Fake a black out
At my night on the chicken run
Need some moonshine
Doctor goodtime
Keeping my nerves in line
Down on the run
When the boys are called together
To hand me out a feather
I'm through
Sweating in my leather
So I guess its now or never
There's something I've gotta do
Just gotta do
What I gotta do
It's late
And the weekend's near
You could say I can't wait
'Till the gang gets here
Eight
And the Angels are roaring
Shining those dips
Straight line for the strip
Shining those dips
Straight line for the strip
Passing like knives
Short cut on our lives
Shining those dips
Straight line for the strip
