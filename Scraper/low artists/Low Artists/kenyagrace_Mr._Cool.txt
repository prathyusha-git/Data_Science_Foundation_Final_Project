I bet he's with somebody, bet she's half his age
Picked her up at 7, fell in love by 8
But trust me, by tomorrow, he'll forget her name
I'm sure by now, they're leaving, driving to his place
Talking 'bout the future, I'm around the ways
They say he's never felt this, not since yesterday
I bet he's with somebody
I bet he's with somebody
I'm sure by now, they're leaving
I'm sure by now, they're leaving
Mr. Cool, I feel for you
Doesn't it get lonely, always meeting someone new?
Mr. Fine, so divine
Doesn't it get lonely, different person every night?
I know what you think about, you think about
I know how you play about, you play about
Gone through every good and time, good and time
Tell me, are you happy now?
One day, he'll meet somebody, she might make a change
He says, "This girl is different, she moves another way"
But trust me, by tomorrow, she'll forget his name
She'll leave in the morning, he'll text her every day
But they both know that he won't see her face again
And that's the thing 'bout playing common love's game
I bet he's with somebody
I bet he's with somebody
I'm sure by now they're leaving
I'm sure by now they're leaving
Mr. Cool, I feel for you
Doesn't it get lonely, always meeting someone new?
Mr. Fine, so divine
Doesn't it get lonely, different person every night?
I know what you think about, you think about
I know how you play about, you play about
Gone through every good and time, good and time
Tell me, are you happy now?
What are you chasing?
Something to make you feel alive
What are you facing?
Do you hate being lonely late at night?
Or are you escaping?
Scared of your own thoughts in your mind
What are you chasing? Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Mr. Cool, I feel for you
Doesn't it get lonely, always meeting someone new?
Mr. Fine, so divine
Doesn't it get lonely, different person every night?
I know what you think about, you think about
I know how you play about, you play about
Gone through every good and time, good and time
Tell me, are you happy now?
