As this all began
Started making up what I wanted to be
What I wanted to be
What I wanted to be
Wandering around
I was trying to find something that I need
Something that I need
♪
Something that I need
But you haven't tried anything else
'Till you been with the one
Been with the one
Started to run to the one that I wanted
Never opening eyes
Never open your eyes
