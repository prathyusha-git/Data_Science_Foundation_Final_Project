Like a freshly cut diamond
Diamonds are forever like family and loyalty
Or real rap songs like "C.R.E.A.M." or "My Melody"
Diamonds are forever like my infinite thought
Like respect in the hood that can't be bought
Diamonds are forever like family and loyalty

Diamonds are forever like my infinite thought
Like respect in the hood that can't be bought
Word up, diamonds
(Like a freshly cut diamond)
Diamonds are forever like friends that'll kill for you
Went up in a jewelry store, burglary, steal for you
Bill with you, split the diamond into ice blue
Thrice he tried to disrespect our kinship, I don't like you
And now you axed out the fam'
But I'm cashin' checks, with Premier on this jam
Robin Leach, interviews on the beach
When we shake hands, nothin' but ice on the reach,
And I teach Like the Rap Reverend Ike without the perm', I preach
There's more you need to learn, I return for my streets
Gainin' my wealth, trainin' myself
For corny confrontration with haters who be playin' themselves
Diamonds, I like my world of rap
Your rhymin', hah, it's like a world of crap
And a diamond is like a flyest girl that's strap
And you can't beat that with a bat
Diamonds are forever like family and loyalty

Diamonds (Diamonds)
Diamonds (Diamonds), yeah
Pick up the pen, write down a sin, let's cleanse
Lay that shit down, play it for friends
Make a few M's, then do it again
J. Cole, who da thought you woulda been rhymin' with Ghost
Guru flows forever like a diamond
The most could never afford the precious jewels
That's precisely why I'm blessin' you with clear-cut messages
I'm destined to invest in urban sections where depression rules
I hope to heal the destitute before I leave this vestibule
Between the heavens and the seven circles
Where some dead homies maybe rest, I plan to resurrect a few
I press the truth against the naked devils
Look at the youth just like a precious pebble
Meant to be protected, mentally we let this
Poison of Western philosophy make it sloppy
We forgot we are the chosen
From hip-hop to astronomy, they copy what we showed them
Niggas be talkin' slick, but only try me over modems
In person they starstruck, they hearts flutter
I'm like the realest one you ever met
If you don't feel this one, give it a sec'
Go live a little, let the years pass
Experience pain, watch the tears crash on to the floor
Hurt brings wisdom
Wisdom brings a whole 'nother sort of understandin'
Diamonds only worth what we demandin', uh, uh
And niggas payin' top-dollar
Once upon a time I paid a 100 for mine, now I'm a lot smarter

I rock diamonds that cut glass out of window panes
Baldhead Slick blazing tracks when the endoes flame
Rocks that bling, rocks that make them jock my team
Rocks that shine, rocks that keep my hand on my nine
Rocks that blind, make the high rocks drop down
One of a kind, niggas best jet from the spot when I cock mine
Diamonds are like your man you always call fam'
Diamonds are like your grandma you always call ma'am
Diamonds are like having the whole world in your hand
Diamonds are like the shows I ripped with no band
Rockin' your knot, stoppin' your plot
It's me, Baldhead Slick Duke, coppin' your block
For you it's only pain, for me it's only gain
Diamonds are like loyalty, iced out like royalty
Diamonds are like my wifey, so sweet the way she spoils me
Diamonds are forever like family and loyalty
Or real rap songs like C.R.E.A.M. or My Melody
Diamonds are forever like my infinite thought
