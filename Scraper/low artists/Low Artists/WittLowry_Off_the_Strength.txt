They thought they buried me, apparently, but buried a seed
Somebody said I changed a lot, but honestly a lot's been changin' me
They started signin' virtual rappers, we'll have to wait and see
If there's a place for me once they dumb the art down to make-believe
The dirt sits on the Tesla and Balenciaga trainers
Just so every time I see 'em, I'm reminded where I came from
I came a long way from three digits on the paystub
To some millions dollar deals I decided to walk away from
I push my limits to the borderline
So versatile, and you only hate 'cause you're the old design
They wanna steal your soul but they can never get ahold of mine
Been workin' every night, it's like my life is stuck on overtime
Off of the strength, ah
Off of the strength, yeah
Fuck what they say, I'm in a game, I've got a place, yeah
Off of the strength, ah
Off of the strength, yeah
Fuck what they say, I'm in a game, I've got a place, yeah
Off of the strength, ah
Off of the strength, yeah
Fuck what they say, I'm in a game, I've got a place, yeah

Fuck what they say, I'm in a game, I've got a place, yeah
But you're so stuck in your bubble, you love to hear yourself talk
And you just can't understand why I don't fit in a box
I own my masters, motherfucker, just in case you forgot
Does it hurt to know you
Don't own all those average records you've got?
You said I fell off, but your views on success are so basic
You talk a lot of shit for someone that lives in their mother's basement
Funded all this outta pocket, never took a product placement
See, success to me is winning with the people that I came with
I push my limits to the borderline
So versatile, and you only hate 'cause you're the old design
They wanna steal your soul but they can never get ahold of mine
Been workin' every night, it's like my life is stuck on, yeah
Off of the strength, ah
Off of the strength, yeah
Fuck what they say, I'm in a game, I've got a place, yeah
Off of the strength, ah
Off of the strength, yeah
Fuck what they say, I'm in a game, I've got a place, yeah
Off of the strength, ah
Off of the strength, yeah
Fuck what they say, I'm in a game, I've got a place, yeah
Off of the strength, ah
Off of the strength, yeah
Fuck what they say, I'm in a game, I've got a place, yeah
Went multiplatinum off a song that didn't even make the album
Did LaLa a cappella 'cause I couldn't get the sound on
The truth is that the journey's more important than the outcome
Look, when I leave, I hope I leave 'em better than I found 'em
And my grandpa's got dementia, so I know nobody's prayin' for me
Fucked me up when people that I trusted started changin' on me
Feelin' like a titan, seems like everybody's aimin' for me
You thought you could stop me?
You thought you could stop me?
I won't ever stop
Off of the strength, ah
Off of the strength, yeah
Fuck what they say, I'm in a game, I've got a place, yeah
Off of the strength, ah
Off of the strength, yeah
Fuck what they say, I'm in a game, I've got a place, yeah
Off of the strength, ah
Off of the strength, yeah
Fuck what they say, I'm in a game, I've got a place, yeah
Off of the strength, ah
Off of the strength, yeah
Fuck what they say, I'm in a game, I've got a place, yeah
