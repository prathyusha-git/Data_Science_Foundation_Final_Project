My sleep atrocity
Had to be
Explained to me
♪
I'm a party
I'm a body
She had to push so that you could breathe
She won't hate me
She wouldn't waste the energy
In her eyes I would decay slowly
♪
I corpse the couch supine
♪
Don't fucking talk to me
♪
Words are finally empty
My sleep atrocity
Had to be
Explained to me
♪
And with an apology piss stream
One cannot bleach out a memory
I'm thinking of all the things
I'd never want to tell you
I'm thinking of all the things
I'd never want to tell you
But I promise I won't stay in there for long
