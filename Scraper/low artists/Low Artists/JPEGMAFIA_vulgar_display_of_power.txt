Coke, dope
Is you coked up or doped up?
Ay, shorty fuckin' rappers now, say she need a low dose
I'ma take Klonopin and mix it with the Nodoz
Zero fear with me, got it tatted on my torso
Niggas be hating for free and they talkin' about it like they forced, yo
Fuck up out my DMs, nigga, I cannot endorse, yo
The only time I fuck with amateurs is if it's porno
Biatch
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I bring the pain, I bring the pain
I'm at your neck, don't speak my name
I want respect, ho, keep the change
I jugg and finesse the game
Go, go, go, go, go, I will not fall
Go, go, go, go, go, I will not fall
I bring the pain, I bring the pain
I bring the pain, I bring the pain
I bring the pain, I bring the pain
I bring the pain, I bring the pain
Coked up or doped up?
One, two, uh
Shorty wanna kick it with a masochist
Showed her who I am and now she kickin' with an activist
Inside Malcolm with the soul of a ratchet bitch
Stashed away that Minimoog and brushed up on my Mandarin
You a lapsed fan and I hope you never stan again
'Cause all my enemies is in jeopardy, better phone a friend
Biatch
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I bring the pain, I bring the pain
I'm at your neck, don't speak my name
I want respect, ho, keep the change
I jugg and finesse the game
Go, go, go, go, go, I will not fall
Go, go, go, go, go, I will not fall
I bring the pain, I bring the pain
I bring the pain, I bring the pain
I bring the pain, I bring the pain
I bring the pain, I bring the pain
Coked out and doped up
(And you'll lose me, bro-)
(Uh, and you'll lose me, bro-)
(Uh, and you'll lose me, uh)
It said, "Follow yourself
And you'll not only find you
But you'll also find me"
(So, rock now)
