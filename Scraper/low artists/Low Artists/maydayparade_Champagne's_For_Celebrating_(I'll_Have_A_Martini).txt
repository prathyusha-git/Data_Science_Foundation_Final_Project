She left her books, her car, her clothes, and a note
But all she wrote was, "Tonight I'm leaving on a train"
She says she's headed west to make it right for one more night, and
Well, I don't blame her if she is
But he thinks it's just one more sunset
And after all, it's her fault if she hasn't caught on yet
So why'd you have to go?
Is there something I could say to make you turn around?
'Cause nights like these I wish I'd said don't go
Is there anybody there?
Can anybody help to get me out of here?
'Cause you're walking down a road that I can't go

'Cause you're walking down a road that I can't go
Try as I might, I just can't handle this
I lost myself inside a drunken kiss
And I, all that I wanted was to walk you home
Save a sad song for the sing-along
Oh my god, I just can't handle this
I lost myself inside a drunken kiss
And I, all that I wanted was to walk you home
Save a sad song for the sing-along
And she thinks she'll be my tourniquet (tourniquet)
As the record on my stereo plays her favorite song for two whole days
And the drag stretched out for miles and miles
And what she'd give for one more smile, and how she hoped he missed her
'Cause, God, she missed how he would kiss her

Yeah, you're walking down a road that I can't go
Yeah, you're walking down a road that I can't -
