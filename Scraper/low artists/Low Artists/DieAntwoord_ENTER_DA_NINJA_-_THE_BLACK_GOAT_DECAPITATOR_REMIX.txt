After many years in hibernation
The grand dragon emerged from his cage
To sort over his domain

Ninja grab the microphone with no fucking brains on and go full retard
Plus we give the rap game a new ass home
Ninja got a motherfucking cool ass flow
Come on Ninja let's go homie
My baby momma's first car's gonna be a motherfucking new lambo
(Ninja kill these motherfuckers)
My blades swing free
Decapitate a hater
With amazing ease
This is not a game, boy
Don't play with me
I work my mic-saber like a wild fucking savage from the dark side danger!
Yin to the yang
Ninja's motherfucking big in Japan
I seen the future but I never got nothing in my hand
Except a mic, big dreams, and a plan
Fly-talking, sky-walking
Like a ninja

Ninja kick that fucking new rap slang
Ninja bring the fucking ruckus like Wu Tang Clan
Rolling with the S.O.S
High energy
You never seen Zef so fresh
Uh! When we mic check Hi-Tek flows flex
Yo we optimistic, not fuckin' depressed
We not like the rest
My style is UFO
You can't fuck with my new Zef flow
Yo, fuck them all, kill them all, let God sort it out
Yo, I'm a motherfucking Ninja

Fuck, this is like, the coolest fucking remix I ever heard in my whole life
Fuck all of you who said I wouldn't make it
Who said I was a loser
Who said I was a no one
Who said I was a fucking psycho
But look at me now, all up in the Summer Saxon studios
Los Scandelous California
Enter the Ninja, Yolandi Visser, the homeboy God, DJ motherfucking Muggs
