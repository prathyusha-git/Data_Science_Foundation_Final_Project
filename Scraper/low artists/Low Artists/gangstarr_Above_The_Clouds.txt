It has come to our attention that a mysterious force is loose
Somewhere in outer space
The mysteries of creation are there
(Up in the sky?) Up in the sky
The moon and the planets are there
And new hopes for knowledge and peace are there
And therefore as we set sail, we ask God's blessing
On the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure
Of which man has ever embarked
Our self-lord and master shall bring disaster to evil factors
Demonic chapters shall be captured by kings
Through the storms of days after
And to the earth from the sun through triple darkness to blast ya
With a force that can't be compared to any firepower
For its mind power shared, the brainwave causes vessels to circulate
Like constellations reflect at night
Often late, word to the father and mother earth
Seek an everlasting life through this hell for what it's worth
Look, listen, and observe, and watch another sea cycle pullin'
My peeps to the curb, heed the words
It's like ghetto-style proverbs
The righteous pay a sacrifice to get what they deserve
Cannot afford to be confined to a cell, brainwaves swell
Turnin' a desert to a well, experience is the best teacher
Thoughts will spray like street sweepers
Little daddy street preacher, illustrious feature, narrator you select
Accompanied by deck, plus the DJ you respect
It's seven and a half combined, over the front line
The ten-percenters, promotin' slander in the airtime
Bear in mind, jewels be the tools of the trade, sharp blades
Heavenly praise, and dues are paid, above the crowds
Above the clouds, where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles, warriors spiritual
Above the clouds, rainin' down, holdin' it down
Yeah, I leave scientists mentally scarred, triple-electro lords
Wild like rock stars who smash guitars, poison bars from the guards
Bust holes in your mirage, and catch a charge
Shake them down like the riot squad, invasion zone
Ruin like ancient Rome, I span the universe and return to earth
To claim my throne, the maker, owner, plus sole controller
Ayatollah, rest in the sky, the clouds, my sofa
Stand like colossus, regardless to whom or what
Numerous attempts in my life, so who to trust, who but us
To supply you with the fire, the burning truth, 150 absolute proof
On the mic like Moses, spoken golden scribe, survivor of the oldest tribe
Whose soldiers died, I know the five families, we shed tears and mourn
But our heads are on the ammo, 'cause the battle's still on
Sound the horn, we come rumbling through the function
Precise laser beam technique to touch something
When we die hard, they build a monument to honor us with
Humongous effect on the world, we could've conquered it
Above the clouds, above the clouds
Where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles, warriors spiritual
Above the clouds raining down, holding it down
Above the crowds above the clouds
Where the sounds are original infinite skills
Create miracles warriors spiritual above
The clouds raining down holding it down
