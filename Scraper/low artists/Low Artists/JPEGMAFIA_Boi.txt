Persiano gallery
Hey, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hey, yeah
Hey
Look me in my face, won't you?
Look me in my eyes, won't you?
You ain't feeling great, are you?
In that case then, I don't want you
Hey, oh
Yeah
Look at me
Streets been glad at me
Gratitude given the love been fantastic
Attitude vivid, I run and y'all panic
Can run with the rough
You niggas is plastic
Hustle backwards a bad factor in fact I track a chapter
From great times you had it
Girbaud and iced out colorful canvas
S class finesse fast double my cashes
So and so
And dust to ashes
Funeral fit clean death check the fabric
I come quick like some neck with talent
Pump the vehic's
Spark a wood to 3 6
I'm in a league of my own
Breathe on a bead
Imma leave it alone (alone)
Little old me
Get the fees and he gone
Believe I've been reading it wrong
Oh my God
I bet y'all wanna live my life
I'm the young Earnheart
Hit curbs when I bang them rights
A-Rod when hit them strikes
Snoop Dogg when I hit that pipe
Based God when I wear them tight-
Jeans
Young Peglord
Pop shit, catch a crime scene
Pussy nigga on my dick like a high beam
Double barrel on my hip, I'm Bison
Two hits, one round, I'm Tyson
No bank, just cash
I'm priceless
We not the same
Bet you will see
The guns come together like intimacy
Who gave a fuck?
Never did we
Peggy on bat
Then imma flee, hm
Look me in my face, won't you?
Look me in my eyes, won't you?
You ain't feeling great, are you?
In that case then, I don't want you
Look me in my face, won't you?
Look me in my eyes, won't you?
You ain't feeling great, are you?
In that case then, I don't want you
Hey, oh
