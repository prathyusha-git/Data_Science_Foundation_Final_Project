There's a ghost in my bedroom, it haunts me at night
I've asked him to leave but he keeps stopping by
Just when I think that I'm alone
It shows up again with a friend this time
And now this is getting old
I don't know what to do (don't know what to do)
Metaphorically, this ghost is you
Now this ghost in my bedroom it gives me advice
He promised one day that he'd teach me to fight
Now when I think that I'm alone
He comes up my way with a devil's smile singing
"This is now my home, you're my wish come true"
"When you reach that golden cloud, I'll be there with you"
If there were monsters in the closet
Well, I don't think I would be surprised
I hear 'em call out from my window
They try and trick me to come outside
(I won't let you down)
We talked all day
I can't tell if he's real or a made-up version of her again
Never alone 'cause I've got you
Get this out of my head
♪
No I won't waste away my love onto something new
If there's only one way out, I'll come back for you
If I get stuck out there forever
Tell everyone that I said goodbye
You're on my lifelong list of wishes
And I could bring you back
But we don't belong here now
If he stays, well that just means I've got numbered days
'Til I go back to my little world
Where it's just me and my imaginary friends
♪
So go on, love, find a new direction
(Hold my heart, keep it for protection)
And don't get stuck on your way
The other side's a scary place
Do your best not to be afraid
Lose it all when we run away
Letting go of the little things you know I do
There's a ghost in my bedroom
And he's dying to meet you
God knows he's heard all about you
I guess he's friendly enough though
I'll see him more
Always sneaking roses in your bed
Says he won't let you down
He will, he will, he will
There's a ghost in my bedroom
He will, he will, he will
When the world is crashing down
When the world is crashing down
There's a ghost in my bedroom
He will, he will, he will
When the world is crashing down
When the world is crashing down
Softly, slowly, how can I go down?
I want you to notice when I let go
Softly, slowly how can I come down?
I want you to notice when I let go
There's a ghost in my bedroom
