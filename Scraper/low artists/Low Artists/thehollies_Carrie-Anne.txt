You were always something special to me
Quite independent, never caring
You lost your charm as you were ageing
Where is your magic disappearing?

People live and learn, but you're still learning
You use my mind, and I'll be your teacher
When the lesson's over, you'll be with me
Then I'll hear the other people saying
