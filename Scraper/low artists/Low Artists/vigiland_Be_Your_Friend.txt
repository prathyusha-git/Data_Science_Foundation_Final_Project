I recall when
We were young and
Never cared 'bout a thing, woah
We were fire
Perfect liars
We were gone with the wind
Everybody wants to know what
Different really means
And everybody tries to be like us
But some things they could never be
'Cause we will never
Turn our hearts away
You and I
I will be your friend
All my life
If I lose my way
I'll be fine
'Cause you won't let me go
You won't let me go
You won't let me
Turn our hearts away
You and I
I will be your friend
All my life
If I lose my way
I'll be fine
'Cause you won't let me go
You won't let me go
You won't let me
♪
You won't let me
You won't let me go
You won't let me go
You won't let me
Just like cold play
You will fix me
When I'm down at a low
No more guessing
Where we fit in
'Cause we know where to go
Everybody wants to know what
Different really means
And everybody tries to be like us
But some things they could never be
'Cause we will never
Turn our hearts away
You and I
I will be your friend
All my life
If I lose my way
I'll be fine
'Cause you won't let me go
You won't let me go
You won't let me
Turn our hearts away
You and I
I will be your friend
All my life
If I lose my way
I'll be fine
