You're like see through
I don't see you

You're like see through

I don't need you
You're like see through
I don't see you
I'm a playa
Folding paper
From the golden acre
To the overseas
Move over please
The over taker
Hot boude shaker
The fucking answer
The fucking last year
Dit was lekker maar dis nou klaar
You got your pat on the back
But you can't fuck with
The rising talent of rap
Don't speak to me
Did somebody say something
With the bass pumping
The place jumping?
I don't need you
I don't need you
You're like see through
I don't see you
I don't need you
I don't need you
You're like see through
I don't see you
Butt
Fuck all
Exactly
Yeah, you're nasty
Yeah, I'm nasty
I've got the ice cream
Cherry Yogurt
Yeah, you know it
You want a lick of my ice cream
Suck
I'm a lucky ducky
I think your sucky-fucky
Don't speak to me
Did somebody say something
With the bass pumping
The place jumping?
I don't need you
I don't need you
You're like see through
I don't see you
I don't need you
I don't need you
You're like see through
I don't see you
The all are masa
They been down with us
So stay one
I fucking love you
Though all the other ones
With no fucking face
I don't love you
I'm above you
I don't need you
I don't need you
You're like see through
I don't see you
I don't need you
I don't need you
You're like see through
I don't see you
I don't need you
I don't need you
You're like see through
I don't see you
I don't need you
I don't need you
You're like see through
I don't see you
But disown your fuckin' self
