I see who you are
Behind the skin
And the muscles
I see who you are, now
And when you get older later
I will see the same girl
The same soul
Lioness, fireheart
Passionate lover
And afterwards
Later this century
When you and I have become corpses
Let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
Let me push you up against me tightly
And enjoy every bit of you
Let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
Let me push you up against me tightly
Let's celebrate now all this flesh on our bones
And enjoy every bit of you
I see who you are
I see who you... are...
