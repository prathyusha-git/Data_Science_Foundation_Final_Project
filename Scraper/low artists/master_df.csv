Grab hold of the mic tight, tonight's the night

Lick it, dip it, twist it, turn it, pump it, pump it
You open the door, step into the place
Look around, strange painting on the walls
A chick on the floor on all fours, totally nude
In high heels, the vibes ill
She's hand-cuffed, ankle cuffed, steel collar
With a long lease attached to the ceiling
The scene's appealing, revealing weird feelings
Make you forget about what you believing
Another chick chilling against the wall
Flashing her boobs, legs spread with a nice vagina
And a long stick, there's a nice big
Painting above her head, expensive
You check another chick on all fours
Chilling next to another chick lying on the floor
Legs spread in the middle of the corridor
Close shave, don't touch what you can't afford
The next-room's a bed room, you become two
What I mean is, you plus another you
You get down with yourself while I watch
Body buzzing like a bed of a billion bees
You kneel down in front of the other you
Time to learn something new
The one kneeling is a slave, kneel for the master
Feel the warm hand on the back of your head
You got a tattoo on the back of your neck
An infinity sign that represents your past
Your master touches you on your tattoo
And removes your tattoo, now you brand new
I'm proud of you, dear
There's nothing you not allowed to do here
Listen to me, the infinity tattoo is a key
Let go to my rhyme and open your mind
Let go to my rhyme and open your mind
Open your mind, open your mind

Pump it, uh, yo, pump it, uh, uh
Lick it, dip it, twist it, turn it, pump it, pump it
Lift up your dress, open up your legs
Your vaginas sewn up, untie the thread
My sublime rhyme inside your head
Your mind is rushing, vagina gushing
Another chick in the corner taking a piss
It looks nice, the whole vibe is totally kinky
Look around, the new room is fancy
Remove your fur coat, remove your panties
I'm rocking a suit and a black face mask
I ejaculate in champagne glass
Your precious flesh is so mysterious
Pierce your nipples with two long needles
Like a crucifix, take you to another level
While I get my freak on, the vibe is mental
Transcendental, we somewhere else now
Still rocking a mask but I've taken off my suit
You rocking a mask too, shaking your nice boobs
I tell you I like you, you feel my piel
We start french kissing with flipping long tongues
We somewhere else now, you dressed conservative
I transform into a big black god
Feel the realness, my dick's lank hard
You can't believe it, a dick in your palm
As big as your arm, we somewhere else now
A hospital uh, get ready for the operation
Lot of guys chilling behind you
Blasts from the past
All rocking a mask, penises out
Drop your panties for the surgeon
I'm not a virgin, it's not a problem
Look in the mirror, you can see it's you
You got two nice boobs and a penis too
Look in the mirror, look in the mirror
Look in the mirror, you can see it's you
Look in the mirror, you can see it's you

Lick it, dip it, twist it, turn it, pump it, pump it
The men in the masks gather around the patient
Waiting in anticipation
The old surgeon says, can you see this?
A beautiful woman with a brand new penis
You clap the surgeon, flip him right around
Bend him over, lift his white gown
Grap the surgeon's milky butt-cheeks
Rape the surgeon, break the surgeon
Absorb you penis into your tummy
You a woman again, complete with a vagina
I'm flipping my rhyme uh, tripping your mind out
Ripping and vipping your pip, flip it inside-out
Now you the teacher, you the guide
The real you won't see you denied
You got crazy sex appeal, all tied up
Kneeling on the pavement, you can't say shit
Your mouth is gagged, you surrounded by
A thousand guys totally under your spell
They all totally scared of the power you hold
You can changed the rules of the game
And devour their souls
Now's the time, girl
Let's head back into the outside world
The world of others, it's time to go back
The doors are stuck shut
But the walls are beginning to crack
Uh, now the walls are bleeding
It's all deceiving, you soaking wet
With no regrets, feel your body sweat blood
Peel off your old skin, time to get love
You arrive at the cemetery in time for the ceremony
I give you a hot kiss, grab hold of your ass cheeks
How'd you like to get laid on this
Tomb stone in the middle of the rain forest
My gaze puts you in a dase, I'm loving your long tongue
Look at your beautiful face, covered in hot come
Spread my wings block out the sun
Lie on my back, scope out your bum
My penis stays hard, you breathing heavily
I penetrate you, the feeling's heavenly
Now bounce, girl, you know it's hot
Bounce, bounce, girl, like, oh my god
Totally freaky deaky phunky
What make you leave your body
Transport you to another dimension
You alone in the desert, totally nude
The silence is violent
You floating above the ground
Invisible energies penetrate
Every hole in your body while you levitate
You start coming apart, shape-shifting
Wild, out of control

All my fuckin life I lived a normal fuckin life
Till I went and got myself caught up wif da mic
And da beats coming dope wif da rhymes and da flows
In real life trying 2 cope wif da highs and da lows
I got sick and tired of getting treated like a stupid fuck-up
So I fucked my enemies up one time and blew da fuck up
B4 it was like yo, who's this stupid weirdo?
Now it's like, it's a new breed of rap superhero
Two defeat deze devilz ninja becomes a devil
Deze God-forsaken wretches will never b on my level
(Who is it?) fuck you and your hole crew
I got you stressing double guessing cause I won't do what I'm supposed too
I don't know u, baby say hello to
My little two friends: 'I'm telling you' and 'I told you'
What?, try to speak but your tonguez frozen
In south africa I sleep with both my eyes open

Motherfuckers tell me to slow my roll but sorry no can do
My style is so brand new, I try to make u understand it
I'm here to steal the fuckin show cause baby I'm a bandit
Now you standing looking at me like the aliens have landed
All hail da great white ninja
Every puss with a fone wants to take my picture
Ninja! jas I dig dat oke!
Is it real? no it's just a big black joke
When dealing with an idiot dere's really nuffing u can say
Next time you ask me is it real? I'm gonna punch u in the face
To help you feel me, bitch I get paid to be funky
But be nice or I'm gonna change to be ugly
I'm zef like a young hugh hef, oh yes
May my enemies live long so they may see me progress
Put the peddle to the metal, and I'm scorching my tire

I got a chip roll, she ordered calamari
Yo we had a nice time plus alot of white wine
Soon it was night time, 300 buck bill
Fine, paid the bill, signed, ass on my mind
Sophie said I was a lucky catch of a guy
300 bucks is not too much to splash for a naai
Took her back my place, mummies watching soapies
Lamming in her stokies, mummy this is sophie
""oh, hi sophie!"" boom! boom! boom!
Let's go back to my room, yo this shit's fuckin on
Then sophie said, ""I didn't know you live with your mom!""

Ninja 'bout to kick a little story 'bout miranda
I was out dopping by the purple turtle hanging wif some homies
Skopped one too many dops
Damn I need to go pee!
I'm on my to take a piss and I see this Scopie
She looked just like a coloured angelina jolie
The cherry looked very happy to see me, ""mister!""
""aren't you the rapper from the tv?"" is ja
I couldn't help staring at those nice tits
Chilling just below them big fat blow job lips
Plus a g-string all up in that salty crack
I said, ""shit! I need to piss but I'll be back!""
That night was a fuckin jol, think it was a Thursday
DJ bumped some 50, go shorty it's your birthday
Miranda asked me in when I dropped her back at her place
On the veranda ninja fucked miranda on the first date
And everything was hunky fuckin dory
Then comes the twist to this funky little story
At my next live show
Guess who's in the front row staring at me like a psycho
Miranda's big green hawk eyes
Glued to the ninja like a red beam all night
After the show ninja gets rushed by a bunch of poppies
I tell miranda, here's some money go buy yourself a doppie
So I'm there signing autographs, smoking a doobie
""can I get your autograph?"" sure show me your boobies
All of a sudden miranda busts in, making a spectacle!
Grabs me by the nuts and starts breaking my testicles
Jassis! I nearly smacked her cos
Those heavy fuckin claws digging
Into my balls was very fuckin sore!
Eweskielik n hele klomp fokken koppe draai

WHEN THE SUN GOES OUT,HOUSE OF ZEF,https://open.spotify.com/album/51EAqzxt0e3vHcYm2CSCVi,2020,951412,"I'm not really sure what insanity is to tell you the truth
So sometimes I feel I'm going in a path
It's going against the river
Going against the wave, going against what other people are doing
But I don't necessarily call that insanity
I really don't call that insanity
Sometimes when I look at the mass of people or turn on the TV
I just shake my head and say:
This is insanity
This is insanity
Normality is insanity
I can't escape it, it's everywhere
Wherever I look it's there
So I'm not quite clear on what the word means anymore
Of course, I'm afraid of dying, everybody is.
Everything on the planet is afraid of dying, whether it's a dog
Whether it's a mosquito, whether it's a turtle
Whether it's a cat, everything's programmed to survive
Everything doesn't want to... nothing wants to die
Everything's struggling to live
I guess humans, but I wouldn't necessarily say this for certain
Are maybe most aware of the fact that they're going to die
And I guess that makes the whole
Journey a lot more difficult, more complex
And more challenging than perhaps what goes through
An animal's mind, but I wouldn't say that for certain
Well, you know
I'm certain, certain people who came into contact with me
During my life will remember me, there is no doubt about it
And as time goes on less and less people might remember me, unless
What I've what achieved in my art
Has some sort of eternal meaning to it
It's always impossible to judge whether this will happen
Or not happen, it's... it's...
Whether it's just chance I guess
Maybe skill, maybe chance, whatever it is that you have
Uh... a following that goes beyond your own life
But ultimately I guess
They say everything will disappear

Knee-high jump, better get far, or it's T I stomp

I can sniff out you proximity hoes, always near some shit going on, but never did it
I don't understand when people talk shit on me, they gotta lead with a lie or some fibbing
Friends acting like they don't wanna talk, then start begging for change, I don't know what it's giving
Niggas be tryin' to fuck on your bitch while they dappin' you up sayin', ""I see your vision""
Fake friends turning on me for nothing, they mad 'cause they failed even with an advantage

Yeah, he has a family that he never gets to see
Spends his time on the poster, people he wants to be
He needs another dopamine hit, every like, every pic
Influencers out here influencin' him
Don't realize that they're not influencin' shit
But to buy some more products to make them more rich, motherfuckers
Tom wants attention
Don't realize real life is worth more than his mentions
He's stressin', works nine-to-five just to pay for his pension
He questions his purpose, feels low, so he posts to suppress it
""Let the comments rain""
A bunch of people leavin' likes, but don't know his name
A bunch of people leavin' likes, but don't know his pain
The biggest battle that he fights is his own damn brain, fuck
His self-worth is tied to an app
Another day, another panic-attack
Another person on his pics remindin' him of everything that he lacks
He doesn't cry, so instead he just laughs and says
I feel the push and the pull
Evil in my head won't go

Got pregnant, had a baby last June and she should be over the moon
But lately she's been feelin', it's hard and harder to move
She struggles to do the things she used to love and I knew
But she's supposed to be a mom, shit
Her feelings feel like they been thrown into a moshpit
And everyone keeps congratulating
Her like she just won a fuckin' Grammy
Since her granny passed away, she's been an inch away from lost it
Went to bed nauseous, woke up feelin' nauseous
Can barely pay the bills or fill the fridge in her apartment
Went online for help, but all she found was people talk shit
Her baby has to grow up in a world so toxic, damn
Was havin' kids a mistake? Heh
No one admits it, even if they relate
She hits a feeling that she's better replaced
Been gettin' high and drinkin' wine just to get through a day
Just too much on a plate, doctors tell her just to take more pills
Tried one, she don't like how it feels
Knows that people have it worse,
But it doesn't make her pain less real
Tells her friends, time will hopefully heal, 'cause

Make a little money, buy his mom and dad a whip
Proved to everyone who doubted now that he could make it big
Motherfucker's on the way, uses pain to paint the people his picture
The ones that want the most of, they never started off with ya
Somehow he has it gone off and lost himself into liquor
Or sold his soul for a playlist to
Play his shit, can you picture this?
Almost losing your sister, then you losing your dad
Then you losing your love or the love that you thought you had
Then you losing yourself writing ""Losing You,"" calling MAX
You're blessed and you fuckin' know
It, feel bad for just feelin' bad, but
He's scared that everyone will use him
Every day is more a product and less and less of a human
Lately he's been feelin' like Truman,
Would people care if they lose him?
They criticize, but can't help playing him the music, I feel the–

Was for your birthday, before you
Hurt me the worst way, I wonder what's gettin' into me
I wonder if your drink's in his mouth, tasting like victory
I wonder why at night every lie still plays like a symphony, I
Can barely focus, you never cared, I was broken
Been hurting since my dad passed, bet you wouldn't have noticed
'Cause you were busy blacked out, stumblin', losin' focus
Surrounded by all that's hopeless in life that you never chose
And here I go again, preachin' like I know who you are
Too busy stuck inside your phone to ever notice the stars
I miss the nights we'd sing Adele in your car
And had you wetter than the tears that you would cry if we're discussing your scars
I know your demons carry weight, don't know what it's like to be you
Know myself from the bottom, don't know what it's like to need you
You lied from the beginning, don't know what it's like to read you
My dad passed away and that day I flew out to see you
Remember? I'm thinkin' back to December
And how we talked about forever, now we talk less than never
I can't lie, sometimes I find myself re-reading your letter
I'm not saying I was perfect, still, I wish I woulda treated you better
Better, better, better for me
How could you think this would be
Better, better, better for me?
How could you think this would be?
On and on and on again, I fear these voices in my head
That tells me it's all lies and I should let you go
On and on and on again, I hear this voice inside my head
That tells me it's alright and I should hold you close
If you don't know how many times
I forgive you just so I can keep you by my side
I don't know why we waste our time
Spending all our nights in this gorgeous lie
Now maybe time was just against us 'cause you had just been broken when I met ya
I tried to take your pieces, and put you all back together
But the truth is coming out, I feel your void when we're together
Not sayin' that I was better, you drink to relieve the pressure
I know, let's keep it real
I know you loved to lie, but do you find you love me still?
'Cause he will never love you, like I loved you and I promise that is real
You can delete all of our pictures, but you can't delete your feels
You should be easy to replace
But every meaningless conversation, I see your face
I'm tryin' to fill this hole in my heart that you fuckin' made
I'm trippin', should've known that I would never find my happiness in all of these women
I need to find it in myself, that's for damn sure
Almost been a year since I got you from the airport
Crazy how time flies, I'm tryin' to hold on while
I wait for your car like, ""Come out at the bar at night""
Now how could this be?
Better, better, better for me?
How could you think this would be?
Better, better, better for me?

Never had a filter, never one to fuck with
Told me turn my sound, now it's buzzing
I was taking back, told 'em, ""Fuck that!""

Tried to show love, get no love back
Never play me, that's a fun fact
And your album sounded like one track
I don't see a ceiling, I'm above that
Wanna see me fall, they would love that
Is anybody else bringin' love back, uh

When everything in here reminds me of you
Everything smells like your favorite perfume
And the truth is you've never been good with the truth
Isn't that true? I miss what we had
Now you're just someone I knew in the past
I see myself in the way that you act
I hear myself in the way that you laugh

See, you were the hardest to leave
You said that lovin' me felt like a chore
But I know that there's somebody prayin' we'd meet
Of course you don't see all the blessings in front of your face
When your eyes are always on your feed
I hate to think you and I fell apart
So instead, I reframe it as ""mission complete""
Go find what you need, couldn't find it in me
Maybe I should say ""thank you"" for settin' me free
Now there's this gap on your page where our pictures would be
Before you felt the need to delete every moment
I see, you just want me erased
I'm not just someone you were with for a day
Nah, I was someone that went to the ends of the Earth
Just to make sure that you were okay
Now nothin's the same, the same as it was
You shook my faith about fallin' in love
It sucks to know that on the list of the things in your life
There was nothin' you put me above
Damn, not even one, so this is goodbye
Hope you find the love you were hopin' to find
Think maybe the only real version of you that I knew
Is the one I made up in my mind, now

It's crazy what can change, navigate in this world without you
I just hope when you look down you're proud, too
I'm destined for better things
And I'm trying to better me

Question when I saw your face was, who is this?
I was shooting for the stars and was shooting from the hip
Just know that I would never change you
Bless the woman that made you
Bless the people who came around when
You were down and out and then saved you
Fuck the people who played you
Your wall is up I don't blame you
I just want you to know your worth
And to love you the way that God made you
Made you and know
All I wanna do is be there for you through it all
Think about the nights when I would wait up for your call
My ex made me believe you can't trust anyone at all
It's funny how the more you build the farther you can fall
When I had no money we would eat and you would pay
Sorry if you ever felt I ever made you chase
Why you wasting time always staring at your waist?
I just wanna trust you love you more now every day
We're at this diner that we found
Somewhere between then and now
And I ask if you want jam for your toast
You spent the night the other day
So many things I could say
Instead I just shy away and I choke
Uh, and I'm supposed to be a poet
So open with my emotions
And all I can ask about is your toast
I guess I'm glad you didn't leave

Now after seasons of talking and watching night turn to morning
And telling stories a second time when you feel they're important

That had me thinking should I stop or shoot my shot like I'm Gordon
And still I flashback to the crash that could've ended we
The glass smashed somewhere past that's when you said to me
""You'll be alright"", thought if I'm not then I'll pretend to be
I'm thankful every day you found your way and then was lead to me
We're bloody and bruised
Assessing our wounds
Airbag in my face, you can't find your shoes
In shock and I'm sad, in pain and I'm mad
Look down at my stomach, all I'm seeing is black, uh
Lights from the back, they're blue and they're red
The guy who hit us never was found, just left us for dead
A million things I wish I could say, that never were said
I'm sorry if I'm here but not here, got lost in my head
A million things I wish I could do, to show you I care
Just know when you feel empty and scared, I'll always be there
Don't care about how much money you make or clothes that you wear
I care about memories that we make, and time that we share
Let's keep it real
It's hard for me to trust, they all went fake on me
I hope you keep it real and never change on me

Yeah, they say that money don't buy happiness, just beautiful things
But I wouldn't mind the extra time and piece of mind that it brings
I wouldn't mind if I could afford AC in the spring
Or for the heat in the winter,
Not being bitter but they live like kings

Hang your sheets up on the walls just to mimic the doors
Can barely afford to pay for a Ford, why you pay for your Porsche?

While I was workin' last night, my fuckin' car got robbed
There's glass everywhere, I'm searchin' for the things I lost
All the things I bought
You steal from me just to cut your cost

And they think I'm out of my mind, or ahead of my time
Or I'm the one that grinds and puts himself on the line
To learn how to win, you have to lose a hundred times
Honestly, I think that losin' is better than not tryin'
They say, ""Make money, don't let the money make you""
The question is, what if it's the only thing to save you?
Would you sell your soul for a price if they paid you?
Or would you keep it real and stay you?
Why do you let us—

Set the bar over the moon, wanna tell you I'm proud
'Cause I've seen you hit rock bottom and you clawed your way out
You figured it out when others would've threw in the towel
I know how easy it can be to be consumed by your doubt
The past me used to dream about the things I have now
But any plaque I have still don't compare to seein' you smile

Never one that could commit, that's why I never signed a deal

Wishing I could answer all above, right now
Time don't heal, only you heal you
All I wanted was the real you
You lied to me now, how'd you do?
Tell me that, tell me that I need you
Told me that, told me that ain't seen you
Tell me you forgot about me

For the first time
Listen, my heart is breakin', maybe I lack the patience
But how have all your vices now become my obligation?
With every slip you take, you change, and damn, I fuckin' hate it
I might take every bottle in this motherfuckin' house and break it
I can't take it, as you've become a slave to somethin' faceless
You always say you'll change, yeah, you always say the same shit
How could someone so wise become so equally complacent?
You're about to lose it all, do you not care enough to save it, motherfucker?
I'm sorry, damn, it's been a long day
But think about it, have you ever asked if I was okay?
You see, your problems create problems, then you drink 'em away
It's not until you sober up enough that that's when you say (hey)
I fucked up again and slept in all of my clothes
For the first time in a while (for the first time, for the first time)
I fucked up again, and blocked out, I lost all control
For the first time in a while (for the first time, for the first time)
Yeah, you wasted years gettin' wasted, I don't need your sorry, just save it
You think I can't tell you're faded? I don't mean to be so abrasive
I know you have a disease, and that you're just scared to face it
I don't mean to make this 'bout me, but can't you see why I'm jaded?
I miss the you you are when you're sober, you've added years to your face
And not just because you're gettin' older, but 'cause you drank and you drank
It feels like the world's on your shoulders, you carry all of its weight
And the doctor said you're bipolar, you think there's been a mistake
And I know, I'm not your brain, it's not my place to tell you what is real
All that I can do is try to tell you how I fuckin' feel
Stuck by you through it all, I don't ever question if I love you still
The greatest gift that you could ever give me is to fuckin' heal
I never would've thought you'd let the liquor run your life
You drink when everything is wrong, you drink when everything is right
Not here to downplay all your pain or all the demons that you fight
But over family and friends, how could you pick a vodka sprite?
Another night and another lie, you try to hide it, I can tell
You're drunk again, 'cause on your breath, the alcohol is all I smell
We only have this life to live, why would you choose to live in hell?
If you won't get sober for me, at least just do it for yourself
Damn, I feel you fadin' away
I never let you hit rock bottom, maybe that's what it takes
For you to finally put the bottle down before it's too late
It's not until you sober up enough that that's when you say (hey)
I fucked up again and slept in all of my clothes

Til I realized at the bottom is the top when forgotten
Pray I don't fall, like autumn
When you feel more like a product than a person, there's a problem
Been feelin' so low, I don't want no one to know
I just need somethin' to cope
Leave me alone, told 'em all, ""Leave me alone""
Then wonder, ""Where do they go?""
Been here before, push away people I love
Just so they never get close
End of my rope, I don't think anyone care
Maybe they will when I go
Maybe they'll talk about me on the internet ('Net)
They never care, only care when they benefit (Yeah)
Introvert honestly out of my element (Yeah)
Still I'm afraid of becoming irrelevant (Oh, yeah)
Pay attention to the ones who don't clap when you win
If they lie to you once, then they'll do it again
Knew the hurt will come back, I just didn't know when
And the night of the crash, I thought it was the end

Hold the pain, keep it silent
No, my time only runnin' out
'Bout the way that I'm smilin'
Can nobody see I'm down?
Do my best to be okay
But that's all my feelin's allow
These thoughts slip from me always
All I think is how
Now nothin' feels the same
No, nothin' feels the same
Searching for where I belong
I just wanna be happier
Now, nothin' feels the same
No, nothin' feels the same
Learning from where I went wrong
I just wanna be happier (Yeah), yeah
The more I learn, the more I realize how much I have left to learn
Remember back when seven fifty an hour was all I earned
And Mom was workin' overtime, just tryna make things work
So every bill that came in the mail came with concern
I thought maybe a degree could change some things for her and me
Was even honored by the dean, that didn't matter at all
I bought the lie they sold to me at the expense of my own dreams
Said they had everything I need, just need to pay for it all
Well, fuck that
They used to tell me, ""Fuck rap, you need to take a step back
Look in the mirror, Mark, and look at yourself""
They almost had me thinkin' I should put my dreams on the shelf
They don't believe in me just like they don't believe in themselves
I took that chip and then I wore it proudly
Along the way I became fixated on those who doubt me
Somehow lost sight of all the blessings that were all around me
I let comparison and pressure almost fuckin' drown me
Was lost until I found me
I treated the world like it owed me
My self-worth came from comments from people that didn't know me
Feelin' lonely, feelin' like I let everybody else down
Barely recognizin' anyone now, and all I think is-
All I think is how
Now nothin' feels the same
No, nothin' feels the same
Searching for where I belong
I just wanna be happier
Now, nothin' feels the same
No, nothin' feels the same
Learning from where I went wrong
I just wanna be happier
I wanna partake in this rat race, don't have a lot but have faith
And how can I create when my mind is in such a bad place?
I finally made some money, but more issues is what that made
Remember thinkin' that I'll be happy once I reach that place
But not so much, I did it, I felt the rush
But on the way, I left some people and things I love in the dust
That's when I finally realized how now enough is never enough
I wear the smile on my face and nobody has called my bluff
I'm honest, I may have added some commas
But what's naïve to think that money could alleviate problems
I let the numbers become all the validation I seek
Now I know showin' my emotions doesn't mean that I'm weak
Despite what others may think
And maybe all along happiness was a choice
And I listened to their opinions instead of my inner voice
The old me just really wanted the world to love and respect me
Now I'm sick of livin' life for everybody except me
So don't text me, all I want is to fuckin' live in the moment
Should appreciate the journey a little more and I know it
Kept around the ones I trust and cut everybody else out
Barely recognizin' anyone now, and all I think is-
All I think is how
Now nothin' feels the same
No, nothin' feels the same
Searching for where I belong
I just wanna be happier

And how the moon would illuminate the passenger side
It's twenty to five, I just passed Deepwood Drive
I wish I knew then I was livin' in my simpler times
Sometimes I'd walk around Nevers, headphones on in the rain
'Cause songs always sounded better than the thoughts in my brain
See, last year taught me how much in a year things change
When I'm in town now and look around, nothin's the same, damn
I don't know what they even mean when they're tellin' me I need to come home
Feels like yesterday I packed the car with everything that I own
Know myself less than I know those roads
But my hometown no longer feels like home
I'm back in town, just not for long
The only time that I come back is to visit my mom
I traded oak and maple trees for a couple palms
Remember back when I would rap songs at Tyler and Sean's
Their downstairs felt like Madison Square
There was prolly never more than three or four of us there
Nobody cared, but we never cared
I guess I always knew the thief of happiness is when you start to compare
Now I'm in town, and feel like a tourist
This is where my mom and dad had their first mortgage
This is where my dad passed, not to sound morbid
Lately learnin' that the little things are more important
Places I would visit daily now are so different
My old house no longer even looks lived in
I can't get back all the holidays I've been missing
You really don't know what you miss until you're at distance
Until you, ugh, now
I don't know what they even mean when they're tellin' me I need to come home
Feels like yesterday I packed the car with everything that I own
Know myself less than I know those roads
But my hometown no longer feels like home
Mom's talkin' 'bout movin' now out of state
Lookin' for a place that has a little more space
So I may not be comin' back, and that's somethin' I need to face
All the memories we made here are slowly startin' to fade
And my mom got remarried, she says she's changin' her name
And my sister got engaged, and she plans on doin' the same
I'll be the last one in my family with my family name
Now who the fuck is even family? Guess the question remains, 'cause
I don't know what they even mean when they're tellin' me I need to come home
Feels like yesterday I packed the car with everything that I own
Know myself less than I know those roads
But my hometown no longer feels like home
I don't know what they even mean when they're tellin' me I need to come home
Feels like yesterday I packed the car with everything that I own
Know myself less than I know those roads
But my hometown no longer feels like home
All these photos are moments frozen in time
They teleport me to a place I can only see in my mind
Remember summer nights, chasin' our whiskey down with some wine
And in the winter, how the air would combine with the smell of pine
Remember sittin' at the park all alone with a broken heart
In my car spendin' hours just starin' up at the stars

Creatures lie here looking through the windows
Monster, there are voices
In the darkness, and they say they won't go (yeah)
Stare long enough at the abyss and it seems to start to stare back at you
Lost inside my head, it's a scary place I've adapted to
Friends and family call and I tell 'em that, ""I'll get back to you""
Too busy on my phone, doom scrollin', spent the afternoon
Stressed out, head down, can barely leave my bed now
I hate thеse fucking feelings, they tell mе to try these meds out
But Doc, we've only talked for like ten minutes, I'm sketched out
Paranoid, can't tell if these people are foes or friends now
You know what it feels like to feel like nobody can help?
I talk but that I feel like you're losing yourself
I wouldn't even wish my enemies the hand I was dealt
Thought I could pave the paint to fame with some material wealth
But tears fallin' in the Tesla, I guess it's kind of ironic
Could feel so fucking broke inside somethin' I always wanted
My demons came to play, it feels like my brain they be hauntin'
Hate myself sometimes as much as they hate on me to be honest
I saw Fentanyl take the life away from my cousin
I watched alcohol steal the life away from my dad
I came from nothing, now I'm scared that might be what I'm becomin'
Look in the mirror, barely recognize the one lookin' back, so
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here looking through the windows
Monster, there are voices
In the darkness, and they say they won't go
Wrote a song when my dad passed, and they said it was trash
That made me wish that I put less of myself into every track
I know you can't just burn the orchard when one apple is bad
But the fact of the matter is that I feel I'm startin' to crack
And they say, ""Don't take it to heart"", well, how the fuck do I not?
When I put my soul inside somethin' and they say it's a flop
Constantly tear my art apart when this is all that I got
They wanna see me on a stage or me left in a grave to rot
I've been overstressin' 'bout overstressin'
I lie in bed and think about this life I'm manifestin'
Yeah, my depression's always yellin' that I'm destined for regression
Sad obsession with progression, still they think that I'm just desperate for attention
Broke dead about around this time, just last fall
At therapy tellin' my therapist I feel so small
Pushed everyone I love away, and fuck, it's all my fault
Is it better to feel like this or to feel nothin' at all?
I turned the lights down lonely
Remember back when we were cashing cans at the grocery?
Right there when I was drowning, but they're first to say, ""You know me""
So sick of people saying that they care and never show me
My grandpa once told me that inside an empty mind is where the devil likes to play
And everyday it's all the same, I just stare at an empty page
Ruminatin' 'bout all the things that are piled up on my plate
Time I take control of my brain, no, I can't just pray this away, so

About a hundred facts I found out were lies
I know you used me just to pass the time

You played games with my fuckin' heart

Sad to think that I still didn't know you
Woke up in a city that we've never been to
I wish I could show you
Even my music, I put it below you
Just know I would had done anything for you (It hurts to know)
Remember I told you I felt inadequate
Because you came from a family with money
And me, I have nothing, I work as a waiter
With visions of turning myself into something
The music was buzzing but I couldn't pay for a bill
Off of people just saying they love it
Had class in the morning, had work in the evening
Then write through the night with no food in my stomach
Just know that it's hard
Damn, girl, it's so fucking hard
I keep telling myself that I need to move on
But it's hard to get close when you have up a guard
I know everything changed, the old me would prolly feel shame
For the bottles I've bought on my card
You would go to the bar while I was stuck working the double
To pay for the tank in my car (It hurts to know)
And I guess that it's best I pretend like I don't give a fuck
Even though, to be real, I'm a mess
I've been trying to find anything I can find
Just to fill in the hole in my chest

You should know that it takes everything within me

There was a brief pause
Then you said to me, ""He's fucking gone""
And my hands are shaking, my mind is racing
My heart is aching, don't know what to say
So I said the first thing that came to mind
Which was something like, ""You're gonna be okay""
""You're gonna be okay?"" What a foolish phrase
Like your whole life's not about to change
And your only options are to sit in pain
Or become so numb, you can't feel a thing
And the days will change, but they'll feel the same
You wanna run away, but you can't escape
Going nowhere fast down the interstate
Only say all that 'cause I know the pain
And to feel like you wanna disappear
I hope you know that I'm always here
The sad truth is I can't bring him back, but can lend an ear, so

Been losing your sanity, understandably, and the only way out's to go through
But they say you grow through what you go through

Just name the time and the place, I'll be on my way, I'm not one to just leave you on read

You don't let 'em drown when they wanna give up

You don't have to hurt alone, hurt alone
I can't fix it, but you won't be by yourself

Someone answered and asked me a couple questions
Told her, ""Ma'am, I can't fix this depression""
I don't want attention, wanna run away
Said she couldn't see me 'til the 28th

I was about to break, I needed fucking help
I couldn't do it all by my-fucking-self
Hate the stigma put on my mental health
Society taught me how to hate myself
But I'm still breathing
Still speaking, heart still beating
Countless nights battling with demons
And I'm still here, guess I'm undefeated
And I was thinking, this could help
Maybe in my story you can find yourself
Hard to understand the hand that you were dealt
You don't owe shit to anyone except yourself
Yeah, accept yourself, know he's looking down
And just like me, know he's fucking proud
Your anxiety is gonna chop you down
Until you start believing that you let him down
But never let it win, the battle starts within
It's where you go from here, not where you begin

Last night I met fear, doubt, hurt, hate, pain
Told me, ""If you don't change, then we don't go""
They'll give us life, and then we don't grow
They've got me thinking, ""Am I really in control now?""
This whole town doesn't really feel like home now
My family been sayin', ""Mark, you gotta slow it down""
Out on a date, she say, ""You really on your phone?""
""Wow,"" livin' through my phone now
I've been feelin' disconnected
Everyone around me, they would never get it
Do they love me 'cause I'm hurtin' or they get the message?
Only love me when I'm workin' 'cause they want percentage
I remember late night writin' here to tell you the truth
Back when I was too broke, servin' tables just to pay for a booth
Back when really, I had nothin' to lose
Back when—ugh! Fuck it, brace yourself for the news
Last year I saw my dad pass away right in front of my eyes
A couple fake friends showed me who they were in disguise
My ex-girl told me nothing but lies
So maybe I was just in love with who she was in my mind
I been lost inside my mind lately
I been losing track of time lately
It's like I barely know who I'm lately
I been prayin' for a sign lately
I been yellin' at the sky lately
My only question now is ""Why?"" lately
Why is it I'm weak if I show the people I feel?
And why is it they told me that time is all that can heal?
And in time who needs to heal me? Been searchin' for somethin' real
And I know that we attracted the energy that we deal
I been overthinkin', overthinkin'
And nowadays I find 'em over drinkin' on a weekend
The people yellin', ""Where is Mark? 'Cause we fuckin' need him!""
See, this is somewhere you can go when you feel like there's nothin' else to believe in
I never could plan the doubt, I never could plan the pain
I never could plan the number where people screamin' our name
I never could plan the love, I never could plan the hate
I never could plan the love would turn into hate when it's fake
I never could plan the fear, I never could plan the hurt
I never could plan that I will be helpin' people with words
I never could plan a heart that was put inside of my chest
I'm a human here with a vision, no less or more than the rest, ah!",https://open.spotify.com/track/5yobzuQqXAmFVH1sOgyBFt,124,WittLowry

I was trying to find feelings
'Cause lately I've been feeling numb
It's not fair to you
You deserve the one
Stop telling me I'm the perfect one
'Cause perfect is perception
Perception is all that they could see
Saw people turn fake like make believe
Never gonna find fake in me
No, don't ever give a fuck if they hate you
They'd probably hate themselves too
A couple girls wanna date you
A couple years ago, I was see through
You would never make it from the same shoes
Never gave me credit when I paid dues
Need a couple beats to put the pain to
A couple years ago, that was me too
That was back when I could barely pay rent
Saving water bottles just to make cents
Spilled my soul each and every night
On a couple beats with Dan Haynes and
Was waiting tables and a waitress told
me that my stupid dreams never made sense
Had a 9 to 5,
couple of people hating and they still sitting at the same desk
I know, I know
I got this shit,
Don't fuck with lames who wanna be me
Put my all into this shit
I'm a problem is how they see me
Thought they had it in the bag
But now it's me, myself, and I
No I know, I got the juice

Yeah, I know, I know
I know, I know I deserve better
We were held together by 4 letters
Took a a couple L's
Ended up in hell
Thought the love was real
Should've known better
Had to bounce back
Invest all the money my account had
While rappers rap about a round ass
I'ma fuck the game and take the crown back
This is a sound fact
Here's a soundtrack for everyone who doubted,
And even me, I even thought about it
Your fake love, I could do without it
Every fucking stage, I hear the people shouting
I'm the people's champ
I'm the new rock
This is new rap, this is new pop
This is new rock
I fit no genre
The one and only,
The new mantra
Fuck commas,
Don't ever stop it
Still underrated,
Started from the bottom
Only see me fall,
If it was fucking autumn
Got a lot of followers
Who would pad your bottom
I'm a fucking problem
Should say it twice,
I'm a fucking problem
Through the pain I write
Talk to myself when I need great advice
Stars shine the brightest in the darkest nights

You didn't fuck with me then,
How are you gonna fuck with me now
Funny how everything changed
Now they in love with the sound
Don't give a fuck what they say
You should come see me on tour
Had a catastrophe
You cannot play me no more
Maybe I should get high
Yeah, something to balance the lows
Something to deal with the pain
Someone to call on my phone
I'm in love with the truth
Did this all on my own
Only real will remain
Maybe that's all I know

Don't mean the edited one for the 'Gram
But I mean the one who needs love, has fear and doubt
And only comes out around fam
See, I'm just a man, I bleed and it's red
Been tryin' to quiet the voice in my head
Too weak to repeat all the things that it says
You're destined to slip when you live on the edge
And I'm doin' my best, but it's never enough
It's always, ""Hey, when you gon' follow this up?""
I give 'em so much of myself, my art, my soul
There isn't much left in my cup
Not prayin' enough, don't know who to trust
Don't follow for follow, I follow my gut
There is no more room for discourse anymore
It's: ""I'm right and you're wrong, and agree or shut up""
What in the fuck? When will we learn?
Together we grow, and divided we burn
There's over seven billion of us on Earth
And here I am talkin' 'bout puttin' me first
And all of my hurt, like anyone cares
I have a tendency to overshare
Crazy to look at a sea full of people
And still feel like there isn't anyone there
As everyone stares, I swear that I'm fine
Tears streamin' outta both of my eyes
They love to see all this raw and real emotion
So they can upload it online
This story is mine, they took and rewrote it
They'll do anything for a click and they post it
But never with credit, my art has been lessened to trends
While people pretend like they own it
Okay, duly noted, things change in due time
Things that I wanted all losin' their shine
Now all I want is to text, or to talk to my dad
But know I'll never get a reply
And that weighs on my mind, not tryin' to harp
But I have to live with this hole in my heart
And maybe the only real way that I know how to cope
Is by losin' myself in the art
I said things that were harsh and I never meant
I let discontent really mess with my head
So many things that I wish I had done and had said
Before I never saw him again
Time that I make amends and pull back the curtain
I barely was there, even when he was hurtin'
And I think of that, I think, ""Damn, what a terrible son""
And I question myself as a person
A human still learnin'
Huh
Just a human still learnin' (uh-uh)
Know I'll never be perfect
That's the only thing certain, yeah
Someone mentioned the music was savin' their life, they relate to it so much it hurts
And I thought to myself, ""I'm so glad I could help, but it's you who put in all the work""
So don't give me credit 'cause I'm just a human who loses himself in his words
I wonder if Steve ever thought that one day we'd be treatin' an app like a church
And hold up these content creators and athletes and artists as if they were gods
Until we decide they no longer have value, then they're thrown away and forgot
See, honestly, all that we are is a sum of our vices, our fears, and our flaws
And then at the end, we end up in a box and can't bring anything that we bought
All the things that we're not make us who we are
Nobody thought I would make it this far
Used to shoot for the sky 'til I realized that it had been proven
That humans are made out of stars
I spill out my heart, it's all that I know
Never been good at just lettin' shit go
Do you know how it feels to sink all that you have in your craft
And still feel like there's nothin' to show?
This here is a poem, a letter, a song
I don't know where in the fuck I belong
There's nothin' more lonely than bein' surrounded by people
Yet all of your people are wrong
I feel like a pawn, I feel like I'm trapped
There's people I miss I can never get back
But been learnin' that life's not about how much water we have
It's about how we look at the glass, that's a lot to unpack, yeah
Dan said, ""Jump on a track, give 'em all that you have,"" yeah
Ever since, I don't know what it's like to hold back, yeah
When the story's authentic, you don't need to act, yeah
Never needed to act, yeah
There's concepts I need to explore, and feelings I can't just ignore
Who cares what you do, who you doin' it for?
Oh, my, how the tables have turned
Since I used to serve food that I couldn't afford
Mom and Dad got divorced, Mom just got remarried
For most of my life thought commitment was scary
But now I don't know, some places you can't take a road

Yeah, I'm lost without it
Feels like I'm always waitin'
I need you to come get me
Out of my head, and into your arms tonight, tonight
Yeah, I don't mean to make you wait
Just the pressure's been gettin' heavy
I know if I fuck us up, we'll be over, done, you'll forget me
Forget me, I'm feelin' bad that I act this way, 'cause you let me
They call me king, but I know my queen will be there to check me
Last year, was runnin' 'round 45th lookin' for SoHo
Last night, was ridin' down Rodeo lookin' for no ho
It's crazy what can change in a year, think that you know though
Go back and forth like a yo-yo, they live their life for the photos
They see me, I'm actin' solo, 'cause I'm afraid to commit
Now, can you tell me how I'm different than him, and him, and him?
Yeah, I know I'm always questionin' things, like, girl
Would you say that love cannot be found inside a vow or a ring?
She laughs and says, ""Only material things
Those are material things, imagine buyin' all my trust with a ring
Imagine spendin' all my love on a fling, got a thing for you
If I had the talent you had, I probably would sing for you, like""

I been searchin' to find myself and not get too lost into lust
I heard once that you can try, but can't fill from an empty cup
That's no lie, and all I ever say is how I need time
If it was up to you now, you would be mine
I'm on the road more than I'm home
And still I find it's only you on my mind
The last three were gemini, I take that shit as a sign, it's funny
You can't buy time with your money
And you love goin' to the beach whether it's cloudy or sunny
And you love drinkin' all your wine until it hurts in your tummy
You call me, ""Honey, I'm tipsy
And really all I want is for you to love me""
Flashbacks to backroads drivin' back to my side of state
I know I need to tell you, I care before it's too late
Before someone steps to the plate, before you decide not to wait
Before you decide not to chase, then you call me up, just to say
""I'm out of my head, out of my mind, oh, I

Tell you I'm nervous
Tell you my story
Tell you I'm worth it
Tell you my flaws and my faults and my doubts
Give you my heart and what's left of it now
Tell you my hurt, tell you my pain
Tell you the thoughts I keep trapped in my brain
Tell you that nothing's the same
Tell you I'm nothing much more than a man
And tell you I fear I may never find love
Tell you I'm getting in touch with above
And right now, can't deny that I'm scared
All this music I wrote won't compare or warrant the buzz
Alone in my room
Dissecting each line that I rhyme
I don't know how I finish on time
Miss a drop date three times
I know that I let you all down
Well, I was the first in that line, so
Sever my soul from my body, engulf it in music, then give you something to relate
This is somewhere to go when your heart becomes cold and your friends become fake
As you stand on the edge of the world, you feel like you're destined to break
And your grandma is screaming, ""You're worthless!"", and calling you names to your face
Mom and I had to move to a place second time that I'll rhyme to paint this picture
And I can't deny I would hide in my room and would cry from dealing with ya
Pictures so vivid, you yell in the kitchen
I'm taking my boxes, I've made a decision
I'm done with your dissing, your father they're fixing
I tried to be nice but you just wouldn't listen
I couldn't wait for the day just to give you my take on the shit that you did
Silly old bitch, never be like you
Never be so rude, I hope
I wish alone and sit, you sit, but this is where we end it
It's crazy to me how the truth is often most offensive, battle tested
Learned my lesson to forgive, but not forget
I spilled my heart, opened my chest
Irrelevant you are to me, but part to me, honestly
Thought I should address, life often makes this mess
I've come to give you more while everybody gives you less, yeah
And, looking back on it all was a lie
At your friend's house and there's no other guys
Surprise! Now look who you're with—I'm not trying to diss
I'm just telling you this that your feelings may fade, but your memories stick
Hope you're happy with him
I honestly hope you're happy with him
And he does all the things that I would, and I tried, but I couldn't
Could keep going on, but I know that I shouldn't
I shouldn't waste any more time
Shouldn't waste any more lines when you're drunk off the wine
Do you find me crossing your mind?
We knew this would happen with time
But I think that we finally figured it out
That we would just never work out
I tried picking you up
You tried pulling me down
But now life without you is where happy is found
And right now I'm just focused on music
Trust you would lose it
Ripped out my heart, you abused and you used it
Love's not a label on Facebook
When I gave you everything like, ""Girl, wait, look!""
But you didn't care
I would just stare at my wall
And you gave me no reason at all when you left
Picked myself up when you made me feel less
Much better off, and at that I detest
Well, now let's just put it to rest
I wish you the best
My friends don't respond to my texts
Yes, I've been busy with 'Kindest Regards'
But is it that hard just to call?
I wanna hang out yet you shutting me out
And you put in no effort at all
Now, you got me confused like, ""What did I do?""
Used to tell you if I make it, I'll be bringing all you
Now, my circles are limited
Few of y'all walked out and left
That left no one to lose
I got nothing to lose
And nothing to gain by not telling the truth
Been barely believing in love
I still really don't even know if I do
But, if someone was ever to make me believe
Then that someone is you
I promise it's you
I never took action, you're Snapchattin'
Asking me where all my music is at
We're talking right now as I'm writing this rap
You're someone I wish that I always could have
And to be blatant, girl, your name is—
Still can't say it, never could say it
Scared you would hate it
Wonder what crosses your mind when you play it
I'm patient, I'm waiting for you
Even wrote 'Rescue' about me and you
Maybe one day we'll be, we'll wait and we'll see
Now, I'm chasing my dream and I hope you do too
And I'm hoping to prove I'm paying my dues
Dad would get drunk and pass out, I'm like, ""What are you doin'?""
Booze and you lose it—he knew it
So he got sober, so proud, I knew you could do it!
I'm out at a party, ya'll tell me to drink
Here's what I think—I think you look stupid!
Sinking my soul into music, I do it for free
And just know that I'm woven into it
My fans, we turned into fam
I'm here to guide you; give me your hands
Tell me your thoughts and your dreams and your plans
They told me I never could be what I am
Now look where we stand
We stand for everything we said we'd stand for
When they tried to give us less, we said, ""No, fuck that—we demand more!""
And we stand tall
Dan told me jump on the beat and go tell 'em the truth
That's what I do, I do this for you
I tell you my story to help you get through
And you see that this life is hard
The darkest nights make the brightest stars
I'm bringing y'all with me, let's raise the bar
I know y'all come feel this, whoever you are

The cancer took ahold of your body and then it spread
I talk to you more now than I ever did—I'm a mess
This song will never capture the pain that I could express
I learned from you that nothing is perfect, but try your best
I know you had your demons that younger me didn't get
And out of all our demons, our biggest might be regret
Relate more than ever, remember back when I would only see you every other week
And every other Wednesday, you would take us out to eat
Mom and you had split, so we're living in between
Looking up the word ""divorced"" to understand what it could mean
But I don't understand, Mom is with another man
You been drinking heavier than me, wish just another can
Culture full of broken homes, we were just another fam
Coulda left like other dads, you, you had another plan
So you stuck around, dealt a life that you probably would never choose
You bottled it inside and that bottle turned into booze
The Jäger took ahold and your body took the abuse
But finally found some pride and cried when I got the news
I know, been hurting more than I show
Inspired by your story, couple things you should know
I met this girl at my show, teared up by what I was told
She said, ""I'm sober 'cause of you, you do way more than you know""
And I say
And I say, ""Ohh, please grant me the serenity
To accept everything I cannot change""
You, you always told me I had to do anything
To have you back, see you one day
I, I wonder if you see me when I fall, yeah
I wonder if you hear me now at all
Maybe if the world played this through speakers
I'd be loud enough to reach you, and you'll hear
My last letter for you
And I don't understand how you would stay so optimistic
You started chemo, fought the battle, never quit
That really left an imprint
And we would talk about our lives and after this
How we would live 'em different
See, Mom and you would put your differences aside
Every day she would visit, see the love and your vision
See the hurt in your smile, your wisdom is what I'm missing the most
I'll never be ready to let you go
I never felt so helpless inside a boat I control
You told me how you wanted to travel, next year you'll go
And your body had become fragile, not once that you lose your soul
We were told, it was progressing and you had less than a week
True love is every tear when we told you we had to leave
And how we would converse it, not once did we need to speak
That one day in late October you passed away in your sleep
I been cryin' when I think about it
I miss your smile, miss your laugh, and now I live without it
I told you music was my passion, and you never doubt it
And people tell me they relate, but now I truly doubt it
Remember cryin' on your grave and yellin' up to you, ""How did I lose my way?""
I won't forget that summer was some of my darkest days
Was asking for a sign, sat in my tears and prayed
When I saw that sign you sent me, that day was forever changed
I know, I know, I should've been a better me
Oh, blame me when we argue, I said things I didn't mean
Me and you are who I wish, you should have always been between
So I'm sorry for the lack of communication from me
I just wish that you were here, so you could watch me win a Grammy
But more importantly to build a family
I hope I make you proud and become everything I can be
I hope they play it loud and send this letter where I can't reach
Sincerely, Mark
And I said, ""Ohh, please grant me the serenity
To accept everything I cannot change""
You, you always told me I had to do anything
To have you back, see you one day
I, I wonder if you see me when I fall, yeah
I wonder if you hear me now at all
Maybe if the world played this through speakers

Lately (feat. Dia Frampton),I Could Not Plan This,https://open.spotify.com/album/4dR2U031e2XkziQH53khB9,2017,11881202,"Yeah
Lately I've been reminded, they say time's of the essence
You pulled me deep from the trenches, I guess we're here for confessions
And lately, I been reminded that love is patient and blind
I can write a million lines and never find the words to define us
I know it's best not to rush
I know you're unsure if you're worth, I know how deep that can cut
He broke you down, so you don't feel much, there's forty thousand strings
Holding back our past precautions not often I let you in
It's not often you let me in, I get it, I mean why would you to
Take a chance on me? Then I get, I mean why should you?
'Cause me, I'm just a waiter with lucid dreams of the music
And you, you could find any guy, open mind in a student
I say it, in case we lose it, I hope that that never happens
I know our love runs deeper than just lust and attraction
I guess it's all the little things lately that make me think
I remember nights by the beach and us laughin' 'til we can't breathe
Or that CVS down the street, I don't know if you would agree
But I think...
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better
Old flames still burn like new
Sometimes they're hard to sever
And these walls don't lie, all they speak is truth
In this empty room, all I see is you
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better
Lately I've been reminded that love is all that is timeless
The pain you paint on your face, I see strength behind both your eyelids
And lately I've been reminded, I'm flawed, and nobody's perfect
The distance isn't easy, but nothin' is when it's worth it
I'm workin' to bring you all that I sense the weight that you carry
I wish you would let it all out and trust me, because I can't see
I wish you wouldn't compare me, he loved you without your clothes
But no, he's never seen you naked, never seen into your soul
And I love the way I see your mind, wonder when I get deep with you
I wonder why you cry when I tell you that I believe in you
I wish that I could take away the pain of how he treated you
My favorite nights were nights when it felt like it were just me and you
Damn, and if you ever cannot stand me
I hope that I made an impact and showed your heart what love can be
Envision us with a family, envision us where it's sandy
I feel you bringing me close, they in love with lovin' what can be
I know...
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better
Old flames still burn like new
Sometimes they're hard to sever
And these walls don't lie, all they speak is truth
In this empty room, all I see is you
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better
I think about the nights you cried as you reminisce on your parents
And the way you know that money can't buy love as a parent
You're self conscious of your ears, your head's always down when you wear it
And you I never drink when I'm soggy drunk it's apparent
I know, I just love watchin' you grow, you feel the weight on my soul
I always mess with a ten, I'm always hot when you're cold
And if they told us our love was just for a season
I want you to know I loved you, I gave my all and I mean it
I know...
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better
Old flames still burn like new
Sometimes they're hard to sever
And these walls don't lie, all they speak is truth
In this empty room, all I see is you

Let Me Know (feat. Tori Solkowski),I Could Not Plan This,https://open.spotify.com/album/4dR2U031e2XkziQH53khB9,2017,29837816,"Quite surprised
Just one look into your eyes
Can change my mind
Then again, I don't mind
I seem to find
All the answers to the questions I don't like
But you make them all alright
Yeah!
I often wonder what really it is that you offer me
At least I feel your touch, even if it's just when you walk on me
Your mind is always elsewhere, it's there, it's on, then it's off of me
I want to feel your depth, but your heart is deaf when you talk to me, uh
I guess that's what we were taught
We open up depending on how many drinks we have bought
He wants your head and it's ironic, doesn't care 'bout your thoughts
You're one more drink away from drowning, feeling empty and lost
But me, I'm no better, she wants to fuck around and I let her
A culture now of ""We're together,"" but was never together
I know you're looking for one night and I've been stuck on forevers
I think it's sad that I'm naive to think that we could do better, but fuck it
I should've known from the start
And even after all this time, I still don't know who you are
There's more to life than likes and hoppin' bars and gettin' high inside your car
You're feeling distant, feeling far, your wall is up, I know it's hard, and so
Tell me something only you know
Give me reason not to go
You have my heart
If I have yours, then let me know
And tell me something only you know
You have feelings you don't show
So how am I supposed to know
If you love me, let me know
Let me know
Let me know
I often wonder what really it is that I offer you
At least you feel my touch, even if it's just when I walk on you
My mind is always elsewhere, it's there, it's on, then it's off of you
You want to feel my depth, but my heart is deaf when I talk to you, uh
A viscous game that we play
See, nowadays, they say love and hate are one in the same
You let me beat around the bush, until you're sick of my games
It's never fair because you cared and I just transfer the blame
I transfer my pain, a shame to know that you could do better
How selfish, is it my concern as if I'm making you wetter
How selfish, is it you just want me 'cause I make you feel better
And we just chop it up to being drunk, that's wine on your sweater
Alone but together, we always make it less than it seems
It's funny how if you have feelings, you're weak, so we say less than we mean
You hate waiting, we're not dating and not vocal
We're game-playin', I hate sayin', but still hopeful
I'm conflicted, I'm lost in a lot of women
I know our situation's been sticky since the beginning
She left me out in limbo, you deal with my indecision
Don't know if you'll ever love me or love the talent I'm given, but fuck it
I should've known from the start
How can I feel so fucking lonely with your hands on my heart?
Your hands on my chest, you whisper, ""What do you want to do next?""
Our generation's taken love out of sex, and so the question is left
Tell me something only you know
Give me reason not to go
You have my heart
If I have yours, then let me know
And tell me something only you know
You have feelings you don't show
So how am I supposed to know
If you love me, let me know

I've been lyin' so much I don't know what to believe
I'd be lyin' if I said this meant nothing to me
A true DIY pioneer here, what the fuck do you mean?
So you sign a deal, now you just puppet to be
So you stealing ideas? So you stealing from me
I put my time into my music, not a song every week
The deeper the trench, the higher the peak
I got to document my lines before you rappers comin' stealin' from me, haha
And they say people lie, numbers don't
Put myself as a wallpaper on my own phone
To remember who was there when I'm looking for a loan
Well, I'm lookin' for some help, now nobody gotta phone, huh?
You were lyin' when you said you weren't lyin'
Every lie's another step to the fact I'm goodbyin'
Dodge a bullet when you left, yes, I'm off a good time
And I hear every single truth in your silence, yeah
Don't you tell me that you love me when I know you fuckin' don't
That's a lie, lie, lie, yeah
Don't you tell me that you're sorry when you knew what you was doin'
That's a lie, lie, lie, yeah
Don't you tell me that you're busy when you really chilling, oh
That's a lie, lie, lie, yeah
Don't you tell me that you're here when you already been gone
That's a lie, lie, lie, yeah
Go ahead and hurt me with the truth
I would rather have that than feel good about a lie
All I wanted is for us to have trust, but you gave it all up
'Cause you couldn't stop lyin'
You were lyin' when you said I wouldn't make it, you were way off
I would be fucking lyin' if I said I took a day off
They talk about the money that they have 'til they pay off
I got a couple loans and bills to pay off, damn
Well, I was on you Instagram last night
Saw 100k followers, only had 11 likes
Guess the numbers do lie when you pay the right price
Couple pictures of your ass like, ""My hair looks nice, huh?""
You're online and hopin' people wanna be you
Without your hair and makeup, won't let anybody see you
What's funny is the fact that you don't even wanna be you
Wasn't lying when I said I didn't need you, yeah
Don't you tell me that you love me when I know you fuckin' don't
That's a lie, lie, lie, yeah

Bitch, you were evil
You nothing to me, that's easy to see through
No I don't need you
All that you brought me was problems on problems
You need to be remote
And live where you left me—that's right at the bottom, yeah
You lyin' if you say that you ain't a liar, I swear
Tryna convince me that I'm tripping, it's all in my head
I don't be trusting, your name isn't even what you said
'Cause you a lyin' ass bitch, so please don't call me up again

Another night, I can barely sleep, I pray to God my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake, I pray to God my soul to take
I pray to God I'll be over-great
Not another wack rapper that they overrate
Y'all spoiled like the South in the Florida State
I'm always overworked and never overpaid
But I prayed for it, yeah
And when they told me that I couldn't, man, I had to find a way for it, yeah
Serve a table everyday, had to find a way to pay for it, damn
And when I started goin' numb is when I realized I was made for it, yeah
So it's ""fuck all my feelings,"" I feel like the villain
Feel like I overstepped boundaries, feel like you're better without me
Feel like I'm drowning, feel like I never had found me
I don't want no one around me
I don't think nobody knows how it feels when there's so many people yet no one to listen
I try to good with the talent I'm given
I try to see clear, yet attention's been blockin' my vision
Surrounded by fake—and, honestly—lately, debate how much more I can take
A couple more shots to the face
I often don't drink, so I'm searching for something to chase
She's putting my hands on her waist
Her tongue's in my mouth and I wonder what pain she can taste
I'm taking caffeine when I'm wake and tired of taking the pill with PM just to sleep when it's late, I dont
I don't know what to believe in
Did it all for the wrong reasons
And now I'm picking up the pieces
Of that person, I was more
I've been losing you, you
You, you
I've been losing you
I guess I've lost me for a while, well, welcome back
Lately I've forgot how a smile felt, now picture that
Thought that I could buy happy
Maybe buy a new car in all black
Put the whole entire team on the map
Everything I have now, had to work for all that
But, to see my dad again, I would give it all back
They just want me to rap
I feel like a slave to this shit
I know that I pray for this shit
But if I have one more fake convo with one more fake person, I might just go ape in this shit
Remembering back, we had no place to live
And you spent my rent money on clothes that you wear
And confusing your Instagram followers for people who care
And you'll never find happy when stuck in comparin', I know
I miss the feeling of feeling feelings
Now every song I write I've been dripping and oozin' real, and
I try to tell my story, yeah, feelin is less appealin'
Them rappers that like to mumble and already hit the ceiling, so fuck
Didn't fuck with me way back then, now it's ""Hey, what's up?""
Is it weird that I still feel stuck?
Think it's funny when I spill my guts 'cause I feel?
Feelin' like I need to stop playing, he's real
I spent last week in bed and the weekend was drunk
'Cause I honestly just couldn't deal
It's been seven days now without you, that makes one week
You turn into someone else after just one drink
Wonder if I'm on your mind when you think
And, honestly, I tried to help you find you—and instead lost me
I don't know what to believe in
Did it all for the wrong reasons

I spent my time just forgettin'
I spent my time on the music and travel the country
Those last couple lines, I've been said it
Last night I took a ride around my old town
Was the last time I felt somethin' for the first time
I took a ride by my old house
'Cause that's where I fell in love for the first time
Thinkin' back, December when I saved every penny that I made
Knew I'd be the greatest, I just gotta find a way
I couldn't even buy food from the place that I work
'Cause the food cost more than the pay that I made

Sometimes I wish I could just rewind time
Want to change anything, want to relive moments
Even if I know we wouldn't work out, that's fine
When the first door closes, another one opens
Told me I was hopeless
Now the same people hit me up, I never noticed
Every minute that you spent hatin' on me
Was another minute that I spent workin' on my own shit, had to stay focused
Never could've hoped it, never could've planned it
'Til you feel like you have nothing, you would never understand it
Complements are always backhanded
I see people lookin' for a handout, I could never fuckin' stand it
I just make anthems
And spill out my soul on these pages
Was meant for whenever was random
Used pain as a paint for this painting
I just miss what could've been, but I should just water my grass
And not worry about if the grass will be greener

See, just like my math, I've been stackin' my exes
You ain't the one, since you I've been sippin' in some
And you and him ain't everything that you wish that he was
You hit Witt and then quit, so in the long run
You just fuck with my feelings for fun, say it!
You love me right now, well, then prove it to me!
""I promise I'm different,"" That's hard to believe
'Cause you talk, talk, talk, never walk, walk, walk
Guess a lame motherfucker is all you gon' be
Never want to be surface, I swim in the deep
Man, I swim in the deep
Hate on my music, hate on my concepts
Honestly, this is just me being me
So fuck your opinion, I stick to my vision
Makin' this music and all the decisions
I'm sorry, fake friends—I was always too driven
That caused a division, you hate but still listen, it's funny
Rappin' 'bout money makes money
Nowadays everybody wantin' something from me
You stealin' my style, gon' have to tear it from me
I would never dumb it, dumb it down for you dummies, ugh
Tried to make everybody happy
That was my biggest mistake

People wanna see you fail when you've givin' your all
Waste days if you wordy, but talk's fake
Whole life in the copy-paste
Talkin' 'bout my mistakes, I guess you can't relate
To the path that I shoulda take
It piss you off that I tatted my face
But like I promised that it's real, I'm not fake
You see the hate's just a part of the fame
You see my purpose as a part of the change
You been stuck in your ways, I been riding the wave, yeah!
So many things I've been dyin' to say
What's it take to see what's goin' on in my brain?
I'm doin' well, so I can't complain; I took the pain
And made it art that y'all see it today
You don't like it? You can fuck yourself!
And give opinion to someone else
I made the best of the hand I was dealt
People that talk the most can't handle themself
So you hear about it's annual wealth
Your bad vibes gon' damage your health
Lost in your pride and never asked for help

You listened to two songs, man, you are too wrong
Here is my nut for you internet squirrels
I'm spillin' my world, you're spillin' your hate
It's okay, you're a lame motherfucker won't ever relate
I'm a shark in the tank, you're the ship that I sank
I can't rap about money, there's none in my bank
And to think, you'd ever stop hatin'
Biggest mistake was to ever start datin'
That's time that I wasted, no time to be waitin'
I should be at Red Rocks and chillin' with Peyton
I'm waitin' on tables, but waitin' for tables to turn
It's TEAMWITT, motherfucker, 'til death on my urn
Now I'm next to the rest and y'all waitin' your turn
But they want me fail or to crash and to burn, so I
Pour gas on the fire
Motherfuck me? See, your mom is a liar
I'm probably workin' while you go get higher
You lookin' for real, well, see, I'm the supplier
You lookin' for talent, then pray for mitosis, you're hopeless
I'm hopin' you notice, your fan base is fake
And you hope I don't notice you're full of more shit
Than the back of a rodent, go act like you know 'em
Your rappin' is surface, I'm rappin' a poem
A trojan to catch poetry when she blow 'em
I told 'em, we we're gonna get it
Built up a team and a vision and always stick with it
It's funny my style, you bit it
But knowin' how phoney you are, you ain't never admit it
Not hard but go hard when your girl wanna get it
Get hard in the back, of a car do you get it
Don't need your opinion, my life I'ma live it
I told 'em we'd do it and all of us did it
My mind is defined, so my body in tune
I was built in the womb, but my mind on the moon
And I'm locked in my room like a fucking cocoon
When I'm leaving my room, all you rappers are doomed
Witt Lowry, what the fuck you ever heard about me
Keep your bullshit from around me

I think about it quite often, I wonder if you can hear me
Sometimes I pick up on signs that you sent to show that you're near me
Sometimes I think about life after death and question the theories
I miss your smile and your voice, I still remember it clearly
I wrote a song called last letter, I put the volume on max
I wonder if you look down on my life and get a good laugh
And then tell Grandma and the others that you're proud you're my dad
I wish I'd cherished every single fuckin' moment we had
Now it's too late
So many things I wish I said, just never had time to say
How can you feel so close from a million miles away
It's crazy what can change in a year, a month or a day
I know I'm flawed and so perfect is somethin' I never claim
They say, the strongest storms show the strongest roots
I always knew that one lie could change a hundred truths
I always cherished when you told me, I believe in you
I hope that you can forgive me for how I treated you
Thinkin' back, I blamed you for all of my fuckin' demons
You drank another bottle, could never fathom the reasons
It took too long to get you the help that you really needed
One day when I win a Grammy, I hold it up, so you see it
I promise, I know you know I'm a man of my word
Lately feelin' less and less adapted to handling hurt
Actin' like they know my fuckin' life 'cause they're fans of my work
Others are nice to get what they want 'cause they're fans of my worth
Can't tell the real from the fake, can't tell the fake from the real
Broken and empty inside, told me in time I would heal
OCD wreckin' my brain, I don't want nothin' the same
Dropped the whole album at once, write it all over again
Write it all over again, write it all over again
Feel like I'm goin' insane, want to feel good for a change
I keep ignorin' the pain, there is nobody to blame
Tell me they love me for me, then they throw dirt on my name, yeah
The darkest nights make the brightest stars
I tell myself that every time I feel like life gets hard
We've come a long fuckin' way since our kindest regards
And still I feel like my whole life is just waitin' to start
I could've lost it all in that crash, the lights flash
It's feelin' like something's jabbed in my back
The car's spinnin', my whole body's cut and covered in glass
And when we stop, I see my stomach slowly turnin' to black
That made me realize my whole life is truly fragile at best
Sometimes I stress until I physically feel pain in my chest
I ruminate, that's like my mind is always stuck on reset
I heard my grandma's fightin' cancer, Mom just sent me a text
I know we always butted heads and never saw eye to eye
But at this rate, I've seen too many in my family die
Apologize for holding grudges, such a waste of my time
So I just wanna say I love you while you're here and alive
Some people don't know the difference of being human and human-being
I'm only lettin' things inside my life, now they give it meaning
I'm only lettin' things inside my mind, now they keep me dreaming
I'm only lettin' things inside my heart, now they keep it beating
That's real
♪
Yeah
Dan told me, jump on this beat and let it all spill
I wonder if I lost it all if they would call still
Some people tend to forget, but I know we all feel
I put my soul on display and that's what they call real
Stop holdin' on, if it's holding you back, then let it go
Your grass will always be the greenest if you let it grow
They said I'll never be anything, guess you never know

Yeah
You were right, said I'd change and never do
Between you and I, think it hurts because it's true
I can't tell you why I put all the blame on you
Then say, ""You decide,"" what the fuck we're supposed to do?
Hate to see you cry and hate more that I'm to blame
When I realize I'm the one that cause you pain
This is real life and you're tired of the games
And you feel like I may never fucking change
When the highs get high and the lows get low
All I know is you're the one I love
As the tide gets higher and the world's on fire
You're the only one I'm thinking of
Put up wall after wall, was terrified to fall
Instead of leaving, you took time to break through
You have friends that are fam, and fam you can't stand
Guess in blood and in love, we don't choose
You say, ""You should try, not just try to win me back""
You disguise all your pain behind your laugh
Been losing sight of the future and the past
Now, who am I? Lately, I've been losing track of who
I wish I could make you love me
I guess so I could feel you hold me
I'm tired, empty, stressed and lonely
Lost on nights like this
The only one I want around me
Can't bear to see your life without me
I'm sorry for the times you found me
Lost on nights like this
Just because we have a heart
Doesn't mean we have a heart
Just because we make mistakes
Doesn't mean that's who we are
Said some shit tonight that I regret
I wanna learn how I can love you best
And just because I hide it well
Doesn't mean it didn't scar
Only time I feel at peace
Is when I lie in your arms
I have angels that I wish you met
And some demons I should keep in check, damn
Can't expect you to save me
I've been lost, haven't talked to my family lately
You know that that ain't me
Just know I love you, have love for the woman that made me
We're under the same stars
And I'm scared you won't love me the same when the day starts
Hate that I play a part
To the hurt in your heart, hear the hurt when you say, ""Mark""
You should try, not just try to win me back""
You disguise all your pain behind your laugh
Been losin' sight of the future and the past
Now who am I? Lately, I've been losin' track of who
I wish I could make you love me
Again so I could feel you hold me

We are so close, I can motherfuckin' taste it
Came a long way from the motherfuckin' basement
Workin' over time, so no wonder why I wonder where the day went
""You will never make it, flow too angry""

Okay, hate me, if you're gonna do it
I see through it, you're jealous, I'm new and love what I'm doin'
You're booin' me cause you're losin', it's funny to watch you fumble

Your team is lazy and jumbled, my team is there if I stumble

It's funny how I'm weak if I tell them that I have feelings
It's funny how they think that they're relevant
But I question intelligence of a nobody who hate for the hell of it
You had your chance, girl why you cryin'?
Oh it's different because you love me now, why you lyin'?
Oh I get it, you're a mess cause the last guy you met hit and left
And that's when I get a text, you confess that you're all mine
All lyin', I've becomin' numb to it
When I said I had a dream, you put a gun to it
When you find me on your mind, I'ma run through it
When you want me back I will never give a fuck to it - I'm on a new level!
I got some new devils, I got some new demons
We're getting deeper than pussies

Not from Atlanta but steal all the grammar

Aren't you mad there's no passion in the music you're playin'

I'm sayin' that playin' the game, and you're a pawn to it all
Teachin' drugs over love, now we're numb to it all
Every shot you take is Novocaine, don't feel it at all

Somebody said I changed a lot, but honestly a lot's been changin' me
They started signin' virtual rappers, we'll have to wait and see
If there's a place for me once they dumb the art down to make-believe
The dirt sits on the Tesla and Balenciaga trainers
Just so every time I see 'em, I'm reminded where I came from
I came a long way from three digits on the paystub
To some millions dollar deals I decided to walk away from
I push my limits to the borderline
So versatile, and you only hate 'cause you're the old design
They wanna steal your soul but they can never get ahold of mine

And you just can't understand why I don't fit in a box
I own my masters, motherfucker, just in case you forgot
Does it hurt to know you
Don't own all those average records you've got?
You said I fell off, but your views on success are so basic
You talk a lot of shit for someone that lives in their mother's basement
Funded all this outta pocket, never took a product placement
See, success to me is winning with the people that I came with
I push my limits to the borderline
So versatile, and you only hate 'cause you're the old design

Did LaLa a cappella 'cause I couldn't get the sound on

I hate the fact that I feel nothing or I'm reeling in pain
I need to shake this fucking habit, so I try, but I can't
And I look down on other addicts when we're one and the same
Remember back, I'm pushin' twenty, those were simpler times
That's when we met, and ever since you're never far from my mind
I broke my ankle playin' ball, and so it's you I'm prescribed
And even through all of the pain, you make me feel I could fly
A couple weeks, and now you're gone and now I'm feelin' the stress
I always wanted to feel something, maybe nothing is best
My friends and family start to question if I'm feelin' depressed
But I don't really give a damn, just put me back on the meds
I've been lost in my head
My homie Jack said he dealt with the same shit
He said he started drinkin' to deal with the pain quick
All you need is a fifth and it's cool to remain lit
So he handed me a bottle, said, ""Take about eight sips""
I'm faded, but I wanna feel straight numb
So I drink the rest of the bottle, liquor burnin' my gums
Woke up the next day at around a quarter to one
My peers would say that ""Man I had fun, right?""
I've been lyin', I've been sayin' I'm fine
But I've been feeling low and I don't know why
Another night, I feel empty inside
Down bottle after bottle of whatever I find
Feel the weight lift off me
Someone tell my mom I'm sorry
I don't wanna lie, I've been losin' my mind
They tell me ""Take a pill"" until I feel alright
The present day been feelin' sick, think I'm just bidin' my time
I take a shot of somethin' strong to keep that shit off my mind
All my friends started families and they left you behind
And here I am drinkin' any can or bottle I find
My body took you in as blood and so we're never apart
Some real shit, you the closest someone's been to my heart
But just like everything I love, you fuckin' tear me apart
Just like everything I love, you fuckin' tear me apart
I wanna be there for my son, daughter, wife—I mean my ex-wife now
I guess that time really flies when you're drunk on the couch
I wanna shake this fuckin' habit, I just don't know how
So you would love to see me sick until I almost drown
And so you keep me on the brink of barely livin' and death
As long as I'm alive, yeah, you know you're gettin' my cheque
You pray my son and daughter will follow me in my steps
You'll create our loves a fact that I'm broke and broken and in debt
Can go a day without food, I can't go a day without you
When I try, I get the shakes 'til my face turns blue
Lost my job, wife, life for a bottle of booze
You promised you would make me happy, we know that's not true
I tried every drug in the book, but they never hit me the same
I told my doc that I'm down, he put some pills in my name
It doesn't matter the problem, the fix is always the same
Always takin' the easy route, like I'm never willin' to change, damn
Now blamin' everybody but me
With you inside my system, everybody used to love me
But now my friends, family, my kids, they can't even trust me
Been losin' all my control and I let you fuckin' become me
No more! I said no fuckin' more!
I know you think I'm lyin', I said this to you before
This time I'm fuckin' ready, it's time to show you the door
This life is mine, it never was yours!
I've been lyin', I've been sayin' I'm fine

Hey, Mark, I know you're mad but I thought that maybe you'd answer
So maybe last night was the last time that we'd speak
Remember who was there when your dad was goin' through cancer
Remember who was there when your soul was broken and weak
You see, I took my time with you, you just took me for granted
I juggled with my demons, you never would understand it
So when you said, ""forever,"" I thought about it and panicked
I lie, but when I told you I loved you, I meant it, dammit
I know I was never perfect, and you hatin' me for it
You say the same shit in your songs and have them praisin' you for it
And we were sittin', talk for hours 'bout your music and tourin'
And even though you say you loved me, I was less of important
I know, I hurt way more than I show, it hurts way more than you know
I know I cheated, but you cheated us both
Your trust issues tore a hole at me that you couldn't close
We were distant due to distance, what's different when you were close?
You're different, I hope you know, we argue now over nothin'
I'm goin' out with my friends, all you hear is someone I'm fuckin'
I know you're not gettin' trust, but cut me some fuckin' slack
I wish that night never happened, but sometimes it's still playin' back
I try to ignore the facts, I'm not the person you thought
Now all that's left are moments and every ticket we bought
That means all our heart, bitter, swallow, might wash it down with some shots
So cheers... to what we lost
Oh, so naive, oh, I couldn't see

Hey, uh, I got your message, I guess I just wasn't ready
To be honest, since you left everything is pretty unsteady
To be honest, since you left, I barely eat or get ready
I been tryin' to fill this void with anyone who would let me
And I just hate how now we're stuck inside this game
The loser is the one who shows they care, feelin' pain
I'm checkin' if you took down all our pictures, just so I can do the same
Fuckin' petty, wasn't ready for you to just up and change
And I know that you'll only miss me when you fail to replace
Girl, I lived across the map, how could you need more space?
How could you be so fake? See, I was real from the start
Every lie was like a knife that entered straight to the heart
Don't know who you are, how could I when you lied from the start?
You feel empty, so you fill up every night at the bar
I feel empty, but can barely fill the tank in my car
They love you after 3 a.m., but they don't love who you are
I can't lie, honestly I still think about you
And when I go out with my friends, I still drink about you
I'm sorry if I made you question how I feel about you
Put you over everything, but now I have to live without ya, aw, shit
I'm drivin' into a tunnel so I might break up
I promise I would've stayed if there was a way I could save us
If only you spent as much time on us as you do your make up
I tried... and you gave up
Oh, so naive, oh, I couldn't see

I think were on the same page, cause I've been jackin' off to Kim since I was in the fifth grade
You see you show us how to live, but its a fib to get payed
Now Mr. West I got a question, who are the new slaves
See what media made, the pawn of the game is slaved up with T.V and radio playing
I ain't pointing the blame
I ain't pointing the blame, cause it all don't hang on you
I'm a slave of the truth and that's the point that I need you to prove
Well, we're slaved to a label, and its funny that labels are slaved to the youth
So why can't you see all the power in you
Kid from your class couldn't pass but he drew, till it turned into music you're listening to
Now we 're changing the world, motherfucking IQ
Walked in the label like yo what it do
So give me a mil, better off make it two
Creative control in a bowl full of stew
So you can ask Dan he was there with me too
Ugh, I don't like this dude, I ain't signing shit
Ten writers who can barely write a hit
Compare me too, check the writer list
There are images who the industry will use as a fucking tool just to get more hits
Do you get it yet, I'm sick of the lying
Indie when really your signed, making it hard for real indie art like mine
Money don't grow on a tree like pine
Lying to fans, robbing them blind, keeping them buying by keeping them blind
Airing you out it's a matter of time, stuck in a bind you can't buy time
Can't buy time, open your legs and never the mind
You're Looking for head and never inside
We're looking to find attention online
We only see surface we're lame and we're dry
Placing our value in things that we buy
We staring at ass, it's never enough
We're so disconnected from being alive
From being alive, so disconnected from being alive
Take a look in my eyes, then in my soul and see what you find
Yeah I used to get bullied so bad I would sit in my room and I'd cry
Now the same motherfucker like Mark where is the song I could buy
Now open your eyes, human but more like a virus
Greedy is spineless
Take from the earth and we fill it with violence
Take and we take we're the same as a tyrant
Never been silent
Learn what we know from a Facebook post
It's a joke now we're looking so mindless
Stupid we seem to define it
On the same boat, when they think we would sink then we fight it
Love is the only thing timeless
Live in an era where we value weed over love
So you can buy a drug but you can't buy love
So you can buy a bottle but you can't buy grub
So you can buy class doesn't mean you're not dumb
Most the people I know, they would rather feel numb
And so tell me when was the last time you had fun, other then when you fuck and turn up at the club
Man I'm sick of this wack shit, You're faker than Iggy Azalea's accent
You have to live in the past tense, me I'm the future in everything I put to action
What's a rap god to a rapping assassin
No one has mentioned my passion
Power through tinder you're looking for action
Now at the club and you're pounding the captain
Never found passion, living in fraction, lonely and asking what your life could be
Now when life gets hard you don't fight but instead you gon' light the weed
So you spend four years and you work real hard to go get a degree
Now you're working a five nine to five and you're chasing another man's dream
Most of us settle it seems, girl you're worth more than you fucking attempt for the guys
Nothing more precious than time, nothing more tragic then dying while being alive
We look at the sky, know that one day we'll decay in the dirt we let die

I hate it when you're here but you're not here
Hate it when your friends turn to old peers
Hate it when you talk but you don't hear
Hate it when your energy feels weird
Last time I think I laughed, it was last year
Made more money last month than the past year
When everything feels fake, only facts here
I remember working back as a cashier, simpler times
Now it's been three weeks, still the page is empty
They hang on every word I fuckin' say
While I appreciate you, wait for my perspective
Gotta keep it real, there's somethin' else in play
Somethin' I can't explain, yeah
Like the lyrics I find in my mind were put in my brain, damn
Is it really that deep? Maybe it's me
Then one day, I came across what the Romans believed
And even the Greek
You see, they believe we create from our Genii
It's not in our genes, that got me to think
'Bout rappers who claim that they're more than just human
Promote what they pour in their drink
Was makin' me think, I needed a substance to create
With somethin' that wasn't in me
But pardon me, please
Fuck all that nonsense
I believe that my music is bigger than me
If I'm bein' honest
And I think that it's lame for an artist
To claim they're a god or a goddess
Because that type of thinkin' is silently killing off all of our artists
While the industry profit, fillin' their wallets, damn
Feel like I'm on a hamster wheel
While I focus on makin' the music
You don't need your hands to feel
Is it fair when we follow our passion
We barely can land a meal?
In an industry where they can take
They don't need hands to steal!
They told me, ""Go get a degree!""
Was stupid for followin' dreams
Your job was to push me to think
Instead you're just hurdling sheep
I spill out my soul into ink
I told 'em I need to pursue what I love
If not, then I'm makin' this money for what?
Buy shit from a brand led by someone that does
I needed to find out who I really was, now...
They would never get it
Said I couldn't do it, so they were shook when I did it
They never could see the vision, they never wanted me winnin'
I never need an opinion, I never was one to fit it
Too fast to follow along, then I'll bring it back in a minute
I take the beat for a trip and I'll bring it back when I'm finished
I see my room as a womb, and I build and grow while I'm in it
I'm livin', but am I livin'? I can't even tell the difference
Since the last four lines, it's been about one week
Anxiety hit me real hard, and I think
I've been sacrificin' my own mental to prove
The potential in me with the music they seek
'Cause the more that I'm makin', the more that they need
The more that I'm open, the more that I bleed
The more that they're lyin', the less I believe
The more that I please 'em, the less that I'm me
I been back and forth, daily
Am I even making art, or did the art make me?
No wonder why I'm feelin' lost lately
Do they hate the art, or do they really hate me?
They're so negative on the daily
But I don't need your help, to me I'm twice as mean
Yeah, I'm twice as mean, it's seemin' like your dream
Is really only takin' shots at my self-esteem, mo'fucker!
You question why you should care
Like, ""This don't affect what I do""
But maybe, just maybe, if you change your thinkin'
Then you would find you'd start believin' in you
You see, as a human, you're made to create
Not just sit at a desk with some paper and glue
And maybe, just maybe, we do have a genius
So all of the blame and the praise is for two, damn

All the teacher sees is pain
But he's playing pretend
Playing with friends is something
He wishes he can
But, nobody wants to give him a chance
Nobody wants to be with a man
Been looking in the future
But the future is so far in advance
Looking at the alcohol in his hand
Like damn, like why
Why god
Why do I do this again
And, why am I getting so drunk
See my dad was a drunk
I don't wanna be him
I, I know im searching for feelings
I thought I could find them in bottles of gin
I'm tired of losing my faith
And then looking to fake to replace all my feelings within I
I don't wanna lose myself, lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
Just to ruin, a silicone kingdom with you, with you
I don't wanna lose myself, lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
Just to ruin, a silicone kingdom with you, with you
She goes to read another message
Hoe, slut, stupid, and fake
She doesnt know how much she can take
She lookin at her body
Its her body that's she plans to replace
Fake, everything all over her face
It's fake, smile, leads up to her lashes
Never been askes about passion
Only been asked about passin the blunt to the left
Or a pick of a chest called him bitch and a mess
She's a wreck
Waitin for a text from a guy
He'd tell her that he love her but he wanna see her cry
He'd tell her that he love her but he beat her every night, with a pipe
That despite she might leave him for a guy with a tie and a job
A mike or a rob
She tired and sobs on the knob of a door
Yelling out ""Please I can't take no more""
And he's yelling out ""Fuck you, you cunt you whore""
Damn, she doesnt wanna be on the news
Only twenty two looking down the barrel of a 22
Looking for a move she can make
Looking at the bruise on her face
Never felt safe
Never felt late 'till the end of the month
Looking down at her stomach
Like what have we done
I was looking for love
And you were looking for fun
And now a life is in my body cause you wanted to cum
Like why, why god
Why do I do this again
And, why am I thinking that we can can find love inside lust
And we love to pretend
I, I know I'm searching for feelings
I thought I could find them by fucking with him
I'm tired of losing my faith
And then looking to fake to replace all my feelings within I
I don't wanna lose myself, lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
Just to ruin, a silicone kingdom with you, with you
I don't wanna lose myself, lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
Just to ruin, a silicone kingdom with you, with you
He's addicted to the worlds most dangerous drug
Don't wanna make you lose everything that you love
And we don't understand
Money doesn't buy love
So we pile up all our money just to buy
Some new cars, some new rims, a new binz
He doesn't have friends no more
An Ipod, an Ipad, an Imac
So rich that he's feeling poor
If he had one chance to go back
Wishes that he never bagged a whore
A couple more coors and a broken door
Shatter the coor all over the floor
Coming home at a quarter to four
Coming home is a bore
Looking at a gin bottle
Got a quarter to pour
At a local titty bar
I got a better a pour
No cover ones cover the floor
Really looking for more
And more money makes more problems
He don't understand how to solve them
Doesn't understand his son and his wife or his life
Every night when they fight
Now he's looking at 'em as a problem
That's a problem
Now he doesn't know what to do
Out of touch leaving ten every weekend or two
Thinking money maybe buys all the happiness too
'Till hes sitting in a room staring back at a 22
Like, what happened to life
It was so many years and I thought I was right
It was so many years never living my life
And im scared that my son turnes just like, me
Why me, my god
Everything I see really is a facáde
Fake love, fake hair, fake bills, fake, bi
We replace as a race and we try to play god
Like why, why god
Why do I do this again
And why am I getting so drunk
See my dad was a drunk I don't wanna be him
I, I know I'm searching for feelings
I thought I could find them in bottles of gin
I, I know we're thinkin' that we can find love inside lust and we love to pretend
I, I know I'm part of the problem a silicone kingdom we're living within
I'm tired of losing my faith
And then looking in fake to raplace all my feelings within I
I don't wanna lose myself, lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself

So Many Nights (feat. Devvon Terrell),Dreaming With Our Eyes Open,https://open.spotify.com/album/0x8V30SsjfBNY2PuQ9TO3w,2015,5628570,"So many nights I pray for the day
I knew for my dream, I do whatever it takes
Now here I stand, no one in my way
And now I'm surrounded by all that people say
Yeah, they told me time is of the essence
I ain't sweating, I'm blessed, blessing the tenants
While everybody changing, I never stray from my message
As I sit inside my room, it's a tomb to every invention
And every line that I never gave the time or attention
I'm learning my lesson, you looking for a mention, it's funny
What you would do for the approval of a room full of dummies
You think I made it? But I'm stuck here serving burgers for money
It's funny how I'm selling beef and you don't want beef from me
My written turned into a vision, my vision a reality
My chips are on my dream and you seem to try to devalue me
Value me as less, I got no desk or a salary
You value me by likes on my pictures, not personality
Living my own reality, manifested my vision
Looking at the sky, thanked God for what I was given
Based on how I'm living, I'm wondering if I'll get it
Your passion'll set you free and your fear is more like a prison
We're driven, living life, hope I'm doing it right
Went through hell with a knife, killed every demon in sight
I went through darkness of night to find the brightest of light
You only dreaming at night, I turn my dream into life
We're letting go of who left, you never thought it was right
So many nights I pray for the day
I knew for my dream, I do whatever it takes
Now here I stand, no one in my way
And now I'm surrounded by all that people say
But I will never change at all-all-all-all-all
I will never change at all-all-all-all
I will never change at all-all-all-all-all
I will never change at all-all-all-all
I will never change at all
Yeah, I could've never planned my life like this
I graduated, got a job and still I chose just to write like this
You see the people need advice like this
Building something out of nothing
I ain't bluffing with a sight like this
I know I'm nice when I write, you're like ""I don't get.""
It takes intelligence to listen, something I can't give
I flip the prespective, you see what I just did? Do you get it?
Now take a minute, no it takes you a minute to keep it real
I'm still broke, but got beautiful women
Who see me as an opportunity
Not human, was given an opportunity from no one ever
Who am I kidding?
Fought for my vision, built a team who all believe in my passion
I'm on my way out to LA, I wonder ""How did this happen?""
I turned my dream into a team who all believe in my rap and
You went from laughing to a picture when my lyrics are captioned
And honestly I want this more than ever breathing
The people that need a voice, I'm the voice of people believing
My family all believing it's all in me to achieve it
Don't do it because we want it, we want it because we need it
So many nights I pray for the day
I knew for my dream, I do whatever it takes
Now here I stand, no one in my way
And now I'm surrounded by all that people say
But I will never change at all-all-all-all-all
I will never change at all-all-all-all
I will never change at all-all-all-all-all

Somewhere in Between,If You Don't Like the Story Write Your Own,https://open.spotify.com/album/1rKIT2C7BONrvYegtGjeAp,2022,642393,"Look
I miss when AI didn't run the world
And people would consume less than they would create
I miss when gas didn't cost what I used to make
Back when I used to make minimum wage
If low serotonins are linked to depression
Are SSRIs just for numbin' the pain?
Kinda like how my dad used to get drunk off the liquor
To quiet the thoughts in his brain
Look, as you can probably tell
Lately my head and heart have been scattered all over the place
I miss when people saw me as a person
And not as the product of what I create
I wish that we were encouraged to critically think
But instead they just label you crazy
Now I know if I start gettin' too deep on a track
There's no way that the playlist'll play me, damn
If I made Witt, then the question is am I also the creator of Mark?
How many of you state your name and your job
When somebody asks you who you are?
We've all been conditioned to thinkin'
That life is as simple as fillin' in boxes
I used to prioritize people who only ever
Thought of me as an option, now
I'm somewhere in between bein' alone and bein' lonely
It doesn't really matter what they say if they don't know me
As people push and pull, you start to question who you are
Now everyone around you wants to sell you for your parts, yeah
Like an old Jeep, or a Nissan, a Chevy
I guess you'll really find out who your friends really are
When the subject starts gettin' too heavy
I miss when we would take photos to capture the moment
And not just to post them online
I don't know when we're duped into thinkin'
That money was ever worth more than our time
I don't like feelin' like if I'm not postin'
Then I'm just a ghost and I barely exist
We're all addicted to this little box in our pocket
Somethin' no one wants to admit
I think it's crazy I'm labeled as strong
If I say that I go to the gym every week
But if I replace the word ""gym"" here with ""therapy sessions,""
Then everyone labels me weak
Either way, I been workin' on me
I miss the simpler times
I miss when people were genuine friends
Not because of your clout but because you were kind
I miss when I wasn't used to get clicks and views
By people desperate for attention
I know they're chasin' that dopamine hit that they get
When they see that they have a few mentions, damn
I'm somewhere in between bein' alone and bein' lonely
It doesn't really matter what they say if they don't know me
As people push and pull, you start to question who you are
Now everyone around you wants to sell you for your parts, yeah
I'm somewhere in between bein' alone and bein' lonely

Swimming,If You Don't Like the Story Write Your Own,https://open.spotify.com/album/1rKIT2C7BONrvYegtGjeAp,2022,613723,"It's okay to feel the way you do
Swimming in a love that they gave you
You drown
But they will never love you like I do
In this ocean, you're all I see
You're not a mess, no, you're an empath on a messy earth
Can't understand why somebody
As special as you wants to fit in so bad that it hurts
Your worth isn't based off of how much you earn
You say you feel empty the more you consume
Do we blame the flower when it doesn't bloom
Or blame the terrain it was planted into?
When you walk in a room, everyone stares
You spent thе whole morning on makeup and hair
Still all you see are your flaws
You nеver would see what they see when you look in the mirror
Nobody compares you like nobody else
Being trapped in an app feels like livin' in Hell
See, we live in a world where we're taught
That it's better to be anyone else but ourselves, damn
Your feelings aren't real, your friends are all fake
You're tired as fuck, you just need a break
Don't know if you know
The lower your self-esteem goes, the more that these companies make
The more of yourself that you hate
The more that you look to replace, the more you'll be willing to pay
This hole got me stuck in a game
That you didn't even realize you were playin', so
It's okay to feel the way you do
Swimming in a love that they gave you
You drown
But they will never love you like I do
In this ocean, you're all I see
The truth is, you're as beautiful as beautiful gets
Wish you knew your flaws were just a shift in perception
Away from them being a gift
Does the dopamine hit when you post?
Worth it when you know people pick apart all of your pics?
You're sick of the comments that say, ""Does she even respond?""
When you don't, then they call you a bitch
It's just how it is, it's sad, it's true, man
Think we forgot what it means to be human
These apps are detrimental to our mental health
So we go buy an app to improve it
And call that ""improvement,"" but I digress
I know you're livin' with a lot of stress
Tryin' your best to find the line between work and rest
Haven't found it yet, damn
They see you were thick in the head
But not what goes on in your head, damn, yeah
Ask you how you are in the sheets
But not why you're not leavin' bed, damn, yeah
They sit there and stare at your lips
But don't hear a thing that you said, damn, yeah
They come out the woodwork
And then they get mad when you leave 'em on read
I know that you no longer wanna pretend
Like all the bullshit hasn't taken its toll
You're tired of strivin' to be what they want you to be
When you know you just don't fit the mold
""Sit there and look pretty"" is what you were told
By someone you used to consider a friend
You ask him, ""How am I supposed to feel pretty
With all of these hideous thoughts in my head?""
Never saw him again, at first you were hurt
That they thought your image was all you were worth
But then you realized you were wasting your time
On opinions of people who make you feel worse
You feel like you're cursed, you wanna move on
Remove every contact you have in your phone
You realize the more and more people pretend like they love you
The more you feel like you're alone, just know
It's okay to feel the way you do
Swimming in a love that they gave you
You drown
But they will never love you like I do

Then crawl back when they're feelin' empty and lost

The War I'm Scared to Face,If You Don't Like the Story Write Your Own,https://open.spotify.com/album/1rKIT2C7BONrvYegtGjeAp,2022,5667676,"Even if you don't, I still remember it all
You were my shelter from the rain when it'd fall
I would call, but never came
I'm not perfect, but I swear I've changed
I still hear your voice, it ricochets off these walls
Give me the words and I'll explain why I faltered from grace
And for all I hold for blame
Just give me one more chance, I'll fight the war I'm scared to face
First things first, I know this letter might be long overdue
Just wanna tell you it's been hard for me to tackle the truth
And watchin' you become a shell of who I knew in my youth
You were the glue that kept the family from splittin' in two
Hate what you have to go through, I bet you feel so alone
You were my shelter back when everything was messy at home
When no one else was there, I knew you'd always answer your phone
Now when they ask you who I am, it hurts, you might not know, damn
Guess I'll remember for us both
Remember when we saw those whales and you threw up on the boat
Remember spendin' days at Fenway, those are days I miss the most
Remember how you cracked a smile when I told you that I wrote
And then you told me you believed in me and my dream-chasing
That's back when I'd record on a USB in the basement
And now I'm here helpless and honestly fuckin' hate it
I know you hate when I swear, but I don't know how else to say it
I remember all the stories you told me 'bout meeting Gram
I know you still remember her laugh, the touch of her hands
They try to say you can't, don't think anyone understands
She's a part of who you are like you're a part of who I am
And damn, when Dad and Gram look down
I wonder if it makes 'em sad where the fam's at now
And when I stand up on stage, where the music is loud
And look out, I swear I see their faces out in the crowd
What hurts the most is that you're here, but haven't seen you in years
But not because of lack of tryin', I want that to be clear
The situation's way more complicated than it appears
And when I think about it all, it always brings me to tears
I fear, as your memory fades
And the dementia makes its way through every inch of your brain
You'll forget about me and all the memories made
I'm not okay, I guess what I'm tryin' to say is
Even if you don't, I still remember it all
You were my shelter from the rain when it'd fall
I would call, but never came
I'm not perfect, but I swear I've changed
I still hear your voice, it ricochets off these walls
Give me the words and I'll explain why I faltered from grace
And for all I hold for blame
Just give me one more chance, I'll fight the war I'm scared to face
Just know it kills me to feel like I let you down
When all I really ever wanted was to make you proud
I miss all of the stories and the wisdom that would spill out of your mouth
Now when we have a conversation, you can barely make a sound
Everything's so different now, I have this hole in my heart
When you moved and Dad passed, the whole fam fell apart
Not havin' either of you here has been so terribly hard
The truth is y'all were the light when my thoughts got dark
I heard you had a birthday and I missed it
I look around the room and not a single relative's here on Christmas
Sometimes I feel the distance has led to us actin' distant
Nothin' is the same, things changed in an instant
And nah, I should prolly call
Always say ""I will,"" but I always drop the ball
Damn, you see the truth is I'm a coward tryna stall the inevitable
Fact, one day I'll call and there'll be nothin' you recall
And I'm appalled that this is how this all played out
A beautiful mind that we just have to watch fade out
See, you're the one who taught me how to make a home out of a house
And that happiness is found when you live in the right now
Not the future or past, just want my grandfather back
Woulda hung on to the moments if I knew they wouldn't last
Just know I'm grateful now for every single second we had
It's sad you'll never see a show or ever get to see me rap
And that's that, fuck, sick of feelin' stuck
Sick of feelin' like everybody has givin' up
Sick of always feelin' like I'll never be enough
'Cause I tried to wear your shoes, but I could never fill 'em up
I'll never know a world where I'm able to let you go
Even though I know to let go of the things that I can't control
It's sad you'll never see me with a family of my own
But know that when that day comes, you'll be a hero in our home, so
Even if you don't, I still remember it all
You were my shelter from the rain when it'd fall
I would call, but never came
I'm not perfect, but I swear I've changed
I still hear your voice, it ricochets off these walls
Give me the words and I'll explain why I faltered from grace
And for all I hold for blame

If I wouldn't take your advice
Then why would I take your critique, you know what I mean?
You became a critic of me
But look at yourself, I know you don't like what you see
I went and sent mama a car
Then got a new car, and now, I don't need a key
You spend all your time on the net
You sit on the bench and talk like you play for the team, yeah
That's honest, here's what I think's ironic
You're postin' balance talk and all you are is fuckin' toxic
Know that's a lot to process, say you believe in progress
But base your worth off followers and tiny, shiny objects
Honestly just tryin' to help
If the shoe fits, maybe you should try and look inside yourself
Think about a time when you saw jobs in a designer belt
I have Find My Phone, but I don't have an app to find myself
Damn, they wanna tell me who I am
I get that people pigeonhole the things that they can't understand
I'm top five, motherfucker, I say that because I can
I know you're mad 'cause you would rather I act lesser than I am
Damn (lame), you're slacking
You talk too much, no action
Haha, I'm laughin'
No one can match the passion (nah, nah)
Yeah, oh well
All bets are on myself (on me)
Come here, come hold this L
Your name don't ring any bells (yeah)
When I stopped reachin' out, I realized half the garden was dead
I've still got knives in my back from people I thought were friends
I can't tell if you're makin' music for the art or the trend
I know you bought some of those subs, it must be fun to pretend
Remember back when I used to sleep on the floor
And they would laugh behind my back and called me and my family poor
I gave 'em absolutely nothin', I had to kick down the door

Tourist,Dreaming With Our Eyes Open,https://open.spotify.com/album/0x8V30SsjfBNY2PuQ9TO3w,2015,15070127,"And I know that we just met
I love the way you take it off
When I break down on your ass
And you're taking of the memories we made
I'll hope you take it all with you
I'm a tourist just like you
Did you went into my life for whatever
Forever feeling like you could do better
Better than me, I'm wishing oh T
Wishing you stayed but today is the day that you leave
As you packing your bags I'm watching you leave
Reading back over your letter to me
You got tears in your eyes
You can't hide it from me
Both our noses are running
While fighting to breathe
And I'm looking in the mirror like Mark
Got a cold heart how'd it get this far
How'd it get this hard?
Never letting anybody in
Now you're spilling your feelings all over the car
Europe is feeling like mars
Both of us know that I shoot for the stars
Check through your baggage you're packing a piece of my heart
Knew it was over before it could start
Damn, now all that I see are the memories
That me and you could achieve in a short time
Together a reason to season forever
You came in and left like the weather
Both you and I know less than no better
Remember the moment I met her
Forgive me for making you wait for my letter
I'm writing this song cause I told her
I'd never forget her, and I know
And I know that we just met
But yes, I love the way you take it off
When I break down on your ass
Wanna have it all
And now you're taking of the memories we made
I hope you sail, I hope you take it all with you
I'm a tourist just like you
And I know that we just met
But yes, I love the way you take it off
When I break down on your ass
Wanna have it all
And now you're taking of the memories we made
I hope you sail, I hope you take it all with you
I'm a tourist just like you
And I think I lost me while I try to find you
Remembering back to the night that we met
Came to my show and you stayed for my set
I'm puking and spilling all over my chest
Sometimes I admit I'm a mess
I fuck other rappers, you fuck with the best
Came all by your morals and buying a dress
Came all by your life and the likes on your breasts
I'm fucking impressed, see love is something that's been over my head
Or fuck if I do it again, and me, I'm no more than a tourist supporting a friend
I care 'bout the time that we spend, I don't want to pretend
Trying to find the line that defines that you're more than a friend
It's funny they say times is money, when time is the only thing that we don't spend
I did it again, I build up a wall with a tight rope to my heart
And I hope you don't fall, we've been through it all
I sit here and wait for your call
But settling down I don't think that we're ready at all
I'm busy I'm chasing a passion, looking back
Asking how did this happen and how is it now
That I found all the feelings I'm lacking
A tourist of time and our time isn't lasting
I know that we just met
But yes, I love the way you take it off
When I break down on your ass
Wanna have it all
And now you're taking of the memories we made
I hope you sail, I hope you take it all with you
I'm a tourist just like you
And I know that we just met
But yes, I love the way you take it off
When I break down on your ass

So sad, I need a friend
Thought ya'll could sedate
Your mistake was putting a needle in
Ya'll broke skin
Now all the demons, they keep on creepin' in
Your mouth is full of shit
I might hit the lip when I piss in it
I took a pic and post it on my Twitter like
What's happenin'?
I hope that I can get a couple likes and find a badder bitch
With nice tits
A nice ass
Some nice lips
A nice rack
She said, ""You're coming too quick""
I said bitch, you define fast
I look up at the clock, how much time pass?
One minute
Oh yeah, you know a minute was straight drillin' that fine ass
She said, ""I think you're lyin', I'm tired and where's the wine at?
And where is all the weed? I'm in need of something to climax""
I said okay, uh, well let me see what I got
I start to search around my house, I found my ex-girl's top
I went from soft to jacking off, now I'm in need of a mop
Then I hear her yellin' from my room, ""Mark, I said I want pot""
Destined to flop
'Cause look at all the bullshit on top
My only chance at success is if Kanye tells me to stop
While I'm at the Grammy's and they hand me the award for best pop
And I think I'm joining One Direction now that Malik is lost
Need a moment to pause
I wanna say hi Miss Swift
If you ever gave me the chance then I could show you my dick
I could send you a pic
I don't care if Harry doesn't like Witt
Like B and J, Witt and Tay, we could take over this shit
Uhh
We could take over this shit
Me and you, we could take over this shit
Hahahaha
But for real, though
Yo
So why'd you send your daughter to college here in the first place?
You pay 20k and your daughter became a sperm bank
Was fuckin' five guys on the first day
She learned how to suck a dick
And still hasn't experienced her first A, damn
She's lookin' up from her knees
She knows about whiskey neat, double D's and the trees
She's gettin' high because the last guy, he left her with ease
Asking him, ""Please don't leave, you said you loved me""
On Tinder swiping right like which bitch gon' fuck me?
You know that I'm the man, five grams of protein and some money
And girls are saying they love me
And guys are wishing they was me
I'm offering nothing more than a washboard on my tummy
It's funny
I might go name my next album The Carter VII
And sell a bunch of copies outside of 7 Eleven
And make it sound like shit so that no one can comprehend it
Baby, must have fucked your ears
And then career
'Cause you ain't sellin'
I'm not dissin' who you think I'm dissin'
It's someone different
I try to be nice and no then one listens
So I'm pissed
And if I hear another bitch try to tell me how she is different
Like, ""I never get around""
But her pussy, I fit my fist in
Insisting that I'm so jealous
I'm jealous of who?
Your screws are loose for you to think I'm jealous of you
You're lame and never made anything but balls turn blue
Tellin' the truth
And when offended, then I'm talkin' 'bout you
And I'm talkin' 'bout you
Stupid ass bitch
Hahaha
Fuck you, you, you and you
Oh
I must be over privileged 'cause I comb my hair
While I'm looking through Wal-Mart
Target and Kohls for some clothes to wear
You stupid fuck, I got a hairy pair
Just for you to suck
And if I bust, I might just bust in your hair
Because I aim high
We are not the same guy
You are just a lame with no brain and a day job
My dad, he got laid off
Too drunk off the Jager
And still drove me all around the town
Wow, thanks, pa!
You could have fucking killed me
I could have been dead
Your only purpose on this Earth was your sperm
And now look what you did
You created the greatest rapper to live
And when I'm standing at the Grammy's
Hi, Granny!
Bitch, you ain't worth shit
Look at me win
I had a friend and he's irrelevant now
Come to find out
Found his tongue in my ex-girl's mouth
Karma's a bitch
And the last I heard is you was surfing the couch
The day you go out is a day that I feel bad for the ground
You're stealing my sound
You're wack and I don't wanna collab
Look at your past
I'm counting every rapper line that you jacked
You sound like me if I could suck on my sack
Like, ""Witt, drop shit so I can copy it and say I can rap""
I've come to attack
You bottom feeder fucks, I'ma blast
Stealing your art and then your lyrics
You're not real, you're an app
Not tweetin' you back
You're honestly the parrot of rap
You're making me laugh
I'm everything the rap game lacks
In fact
Go ahead, compare to the greatest again
They said that Em sounds like Nas
And Hop sounds like Em
And I sound like Hop
So where do we end?
Stop comparing me
Comparing what you can't comprehend
Can't wrap your head around the fact that I'm just nice with a pen
I'm standing up and talking shit, I'm never one to pretend
Never one that would blend
I'm not Eminem and I'm not Lennon
I'ma lead a generation and pick it up where they left it

Weak,If You Don't Like the Story Write Your Own,https://open.spotify.com/album/1rKIT2C7BONrvYegtGjeAp,2022,1175153,"I wonder if he knows that you can't stand the color blue
Or you love yellow like a signal off of parachutes
I hate how everyone I meet now, I compare to you
To keep it real, I always thought that I would marry you
I wonder if he noticed that you're not a fan of roses
That's why I always bought you lilies, bet you didn't notice
He loves you at your high, but me, I loved you at your lowest
And even though it's over, grateful that we had our moment
I wonder if he knows you really don't believe in luck
And since your parents split, you really don't believe in love
I wish that you believed in me like I believed in us
Heard through the grapevine he gets jealous when you bring me up
I wonder if he knows he found himself a queen now
See you been takin' him to all the spots that we found
I see your posts and you look happy as can be now
You only know if that's for show or how you're feelin' deep down, damn
Oh, I'm weak to my knees
I find it hard just to breathe
Knowin' you could just leave
You said you'd never let go, you'd never leave me
You'd never leave me, you'd never leave me weak
I wonder if you leave your lashes on his bathroom counter
Remember how we used to stay up, and would talk for hours?
Does he know that you showed him all the songs you said were ours?
And that your favorite time to sing is when you're in the shower?
I wonder if you like the fact that he is nothin' like me
I feel too deep, just like you always said, I'm such a Pisces
Guess you meant nothin' in those letters that you used to write me
Followed my heart because you always said to let it guide me
I wonder if he knows how bad you wanna visit London
Damn, is this really who one day you're gonna call your husband?
I wish you loved me in the ways that now you say you love him
Yeah, I admit, I'm envious, and really wish I wasn't
I wonder if it would've worked if the timin' was different
See, since you left, it always feels like there's somethin' that's missin'
Does he care more about your passion or favorite position?
Or would you rather never ask him to ponder the difference?
Last time we talked, your mom was workin' hard at stayin' sober
Still hope that you and her are workin' on becomin' closer
Sometimes it's hard to just accept that you and I are over
I guess I wrote this more for me because I needed closure
I wonder if you ever wonder if I'm doin' fine
Or if you ever have those moments where I cross your mind
See, time itself, it doesn't heal, you heal yourself with time
I've just become another someone that you left behind, damn
Oh, I'm weak to my knees
I find it hard just to breathe

It's Friday night, your local dive got you diving back in
All these other men around all they are are practice
Daddy's money it don't make up for the sense you're lacking
And you tell your friends you're happy but we know you're acting
You don't know why, all you want is emotion

A couple things you still needing to cope with
You're not alone, just know you're not alone

Graduated, got a job and you been working a grind
You're never looking behind
I know you never found me crossing your mind
But I'd be lying if you didn't cross mine
From time to time I see some of your pictures online
Kindest Regards was hard, I left my heart on the line
I wrote a song for you, took a couple months of my time
How can you praise him for flowers and a bottle of wine?
You'll never be mine, remember the time I came to see you?
I thought it would just be you, but there's twelve other people
You see there was never ""We"" so we could never be a sequel
Thought it might've been a date that day, did anything to see you
But I'm nothing more than nothing, you're bluffing, saying you care
Our only real connection is memories that we share
I would never try to blame you, 'cause blaming you isn't fair
Not that you care, the stress is really starting to wear
And in my music, I took our story and I used it
Don't care how you were feeling, I'm busy dropping my new shit
Know people gonna love it, I'm buzzing after I do it
I'm gifted with the curse of honesty and the truth is
I loved you more than words, I didn't know how to prove it
Can't tell you that in person, but always could through my music
Everyone who said they cared isn't there, now I'm confused
I'm broken and bruised, lonely, open, empty and stupid and still I
I thought I had it all figured out
No, you would never fall for me now
I wonder if you wonder why I'm never around
I wonder if you, I wonder if you wonder what I'm doing right now
You can hear the pain in my sound, laughed as I fell to the ground
I wonder if you wonder why I'm never around
I wonder if you, I wonder if you wonder what I'm doing right now
And I can't lie, it hurt a little when you said you didn't want me
To know I never tried is what continues to haunt me
Every pic I see is you and him, his twitter trying to taunt me
You think I let it go? This is old and exhausting
Some offspring, family in a house is what I thought about
Sometimes I wonder if he'll get that now
See we know that you picked a different path
Me, I picked a different route
And I can't help but laugh at how this all played out
You're over me now, I'm hoping you found only the best
Remember when we used to rep that Kanye West?
Graduation and rotation 'cause you liked that best
And back then I didn't want you, now look I'm a mess
I open my chest and through me you can see no spine
My profile pic and lyrics I've been hiding behind
It looks like you found the love that I was hoping to find
The only you I love is the one that I create in my mind and still I
I thought I had it all figured out
No, you would never fall for me now
I wonder if you wonder why I'm never around

You can hear the pain in my sound, laughed as I fell to the ground
I wonder if you wonder why I'm never around
I wonder if you, I wonder if you wonder what I'm doing right now
I often wonder if you ever did care
I wonder why in my mind is the only time you ever were there
See we were friends, but that felt more like pretend
This year is awfully clear, the real us is what I fear
The one where we were only friends and I acted like we dated
And nowadays our conversation is, ""Hey happy belated""
And every song I wrote for you, you know you actually hate it
Because you realize that you never felt the same when you played it
You never cared if I made it, that's why I waited, you know me
See, all the love that I've been getting through my phone feels phony
I rhyme a couple words together, every girl wanna blow me
We're in a world full of people, yet I'm feeling so lonely
If only I could tell myself there's plenty fish in the sea
But see the sea is full of sharks, fake guppies and greed
And as I find myself drowning while I'm fighting to breathe
I realise that I'm in love with what I thought we could

""Last Letter"" at my show, I know they feel that
I show the people perseverance when I feel sad
I put the music out for free and yet I feel trapped
I used to never own a thing and now I own shit

Your ex he cheated on you
My ex she cheated on me
Want to say thank you to them
They gave us reasons to leave
Lost faith in falling in love
You came and made me believe
I've got hurt in my heart, deep
You'd have to fucking rip it out to see I'm insecure
I can't stop obsessing on my successes
No matter what I do I just never could see my blessings
So every conversation you try to gage where my head is
Cause it never seems to be on the top
And we're dissecting
We're spending our time on everything other than me and you
When I start to feel the pressure
You feel the pressure times two
We fight, you start to cry
I feel like I'm coming unglued
I walk away when really all I want to say is that I love you
Once again my stubbornness has got the best of me
When I want to get under your skin, I know the recipe
We're on the same team
Don't need to treat you like the enemy
I tell you that I'm fine
That's when you say you're testing me, I know you're testing me
I, I should probably let you in but I don't know how
I should probably let you win but I can't back down
I don't want you to leave and I tell you to go
We've been at it all day with our backs to the rope
I would always start a fight and I don't know why
I would probably say your right if I saw your side
I don't want you to leave and I tell you to go
We've been at it all day with our backs to the rope
You tell me, Mark, shut up, just let it go
So immaterial this stupid shit you fight me for
I know you're right but I'm too proud to ever let you know
Surrounded by a million people
Only feel like when you're there is when I'm not alone
Get off your fucking phone you say, you're rude for no reason
I want to tell you that I'm sorry
Yah, I tell you I'm leaving
You say you love the real me, even when I don't believe it
I said some shit I didn't mean
You say, why don't you repeat it, motherfucker
Now why don't you think about what you said
Instead of saying I love you, I'm going out with my friends
Instead of saying I love you, I say I'm going to bed
I hate the fact that they're sad so the battles
Inside your head killing my egos become bigger than my heart
I wanna end this fucking fight, it's just I don't know where to start
So you don't treat me like a product, you appreciate the art
I want you to know I care about you and it's easy and it's hard
I know it's hard but
If everything were to crash
I wouldn't give a single second that I spent with you back
So you make me a better me, you're everything that I lack
I'd give you the sun and the stars but all I have is this track
I should probably let you in but I don't know how
I should probably let you win but I can't back down
I don't want you to leave and I tell you to go
We've been at it all day with our backs to the rope
I would always start a fight and I don't know why
I would probably say your right if I saw your side

Influencers out here influencin' him
Don't realize that they're not influencin' shit
But to buy some more products to make them more rich, motherfuckers
Tom wants attention
Don't realize real life is worth more than his mentions
He's stressin', works nine-to-five just to pay for his pension
He questions his purpose, feels low, so he posts to suppress it

A bunch of people leavin' likes, but don't know his pain
The biggest battle that he fights is his own damn brain, fuck

He doesn't cry, so instead he just laughs and says

Went online for help, but all she found was people talk shit

Was havin' kids a mistake? Heh
No one admits it, even if they relate

Been gettin' high and drinkin' wine just to get through a day

But I know that there's somebody prayin' we'd meet
Of course you don't see all the blessings in front of your face
When your eyes are always on your feed
I hate to think you and I fell apart
So instead, I reframe it as ""mission complete""
Go find what you need, couldn't find it in me
Maybe I should say ""thank you"" for settin' me free
Now there's this gap on your page where our pictures would be
Before you felt the need to delete every moment
I see, you just want me erased
I'm not just someone you were with for a day
Nah, I was someone that went to the ends of the Earth
Just to make sure that you were okay
Now nothin's the same, the same as it was
You shook my faith about fallin' in love
It sucks to know that on the list of the things in your life
There was nothin' you put me above
Damn, not even one, so this is goodbye
Hope you find the love you were hopin' to find
Think maybe the only real version of you that I knew
Is the one I made up in my mind, now
We both act like we don't exist
But deep down we know, it shouldn't end like this
And time will pass while we both resist
Deep down we know, it shouldn't end like (End like)

I've been finding better days
But I'm finding everything changes (Changes, changes, changes)
Everything changes
Yeah, it's summertime in CT, around a quarter to nine
The music loud, the windows down, passed Nevers Road while I drive
Gambino bumpin' through the system, those were simpler times
When things were perfectly imperfect and my music wasn't easy to find
Back when I still could call my dad one more time
Back when I still could call my
Grandpa 'til dementia started takin' his mind
So many times I took for granted our time
To say I was a perfect son or grandson, to keep it real, I'd be lyin'
I wanna try to be better, I wanna give more than I take
I miss our moments together, I'll try to learn from my mistakes
Until I'm better than ever, I'll try to turn my pain to paint
Is this a song or a letter? Because the two just feel the same
I saw my ex is now engaged since yesterday and I smiled
I hope you finally found the love you were searchin' for for a while
Hope they take an inch and give you a mile
If everything that went wrong had went
Right, might be a whole different aisle
Think I'm too busy postin' pictures of our sold-out shows
That I forgot about the people and the love back home
The ones who'd champion for Mark when Witt was much less known
And now I barely even answer my phone, damn
I'm destined for better things
And I'm trying to better me
I've been finding better days
But I'm finding everything changes (Changes, changes, changes)
Everything changes
Yeah, it's wintertime in Amsterdam, TEAMWITT is waiting outside
Songs recorded in my closet, now they wanna see live
Dan comes inside, I say,
""Can you believe we're here or that there's even a line?""
He laughs and says, ""Of course,
Imagine us workin' a nine-to-five,"" that's no lie
Whilst your degree will put you deeper in debt
Your student loan just seems to grow and now it's more than your check
How can you plan to see the world if you're just stuck at a desk?
How can you calculate success by the results on a test? I digress
Sometimes I have to just admit I'm a mess
Don't try to try harder for someone who's not tryin' their best
You used to say I was a no one and now you're the first to text
No longer holdin' on the grudges, forgive but I don't forget
Can't change the people around you, so change the people around you
Hold on to those who care and let go of the ones that doubt you
It's crazy what can change, navigate in this world without you
I just hope when you look down you're proud, too
I'm destined for better things

Say no more, but, tell me this (what)
Can you taste the pain in me, on my lips
Question when I saw your face was, who is this?
I was shooting for the stars and was shooting from the hip
Just know that I would never change you
Bless the woman that made you
Bless the people who came around when
You were down and out and then saved you
Fuck the people who played you
Your wall is up I don't blame you
I just want you to know your worth
And to love you the way that God made you
Made you and know
All I wanna do is be there for you through it all
Think about the nights when I would wait up for your call
My ex made me believe you can't trust anyone at all
It's funny how the more you build the farther you can fall
When I had no money we would eat and you would pay
Sorry if you ever felt I ever made you chase
Why you wasting time always staring at your waist?
I just wanna trust you love you more now every day
We're at this diner that we found
Somewhere between then and now
And I ask if you want jam for your toast
You spent the night the other day
So many things I could say
Instead I just shy away and I choke
Uh, and I'm supposed to be a poet
So open with my emotions
And all I can ask about is your toast
I guess I'm glad you didn't leave
'Cause you make me a better me

Now after seasons of talking and watching night turn to morning
And telling stories a second time when you feel they're important
The love I have for you is rare I was just scared 'cause it's foreign
That had me thinking should I stop or shoot my shot like I'm Gordon
And still I flashback to the crash that could've ended we
The glass smashed somewhere past that's when you said to me
""You'll be alright"", thought if I'm not then I'll pretend to be
I'm thankful every day you found your way and then was lead to me
We're bloody and bruised
Assessing our wounds
Airbag in my face, you can't find your shoes
In shock and I'm sad, in pain and I'm mad
Look down at my stomach, all I'm seeing is black, uh
Lights from the back, they're blue and they're red
The guy who hit us never was found, just left us for dead
A million things I wish I could say, that never were said
I'm sorry if I'm here but not here, got lost in my head
A million things I wish I could do, to show you I care
Just know when you feel empty and scared, I'll always be there
Don't care about how much money you make or clothes that you wear
I care about memories that we make, and time that we share
Let's keep it real
It's hard for me to trust, they all went fake on me
I hope you keep it real and never change on me
You tell me when it's heavy put that weight on me
On me, on me, so

(I'll be honest with you)
Fuck it!
Another day (Another day), another night (Another night)
Another fucking battle in my mind
A lotta love (Lotta love), a lotta hate (Lotta hate)
A lot who wanna see me unwind
I'm feelin' low (Feelin' low), all alone (All alone)
""Now get your shit together"" is what I'm told
Been feelin' low (Feelin' low), super low (Super low)
And they won't even care til I'm ghost (Yeah)
Used to dream of the top, had nightmares at the bottom
Til I realized at the bottom is the top when forgotten
Pray I don't fall, like autumn
When you feel more like a product than a person, there's a problem
Been feelin' so low, I don't want no one to know
I just need somethin' to cope
Leave me alone, told 'em all, ""Leave me alone""
Then wonder, ""Where do they go?""
Been here before, push away people I love
Just so they never get close
End of my rope, I don't think anyone care
Maybe they will when I go
Maybe they'll talk about me on the internet ('Net)
They never care, only care when they benefit (Yeah)
Introvert honestly out of my element (Yeah)
Still I'm afraid of becoming irrelevant (Oh, yeah)
Pay attention to the ones who don't clap when you win
If they lie to you once, then they'll do it again
Knew the hurt will come back, I just didn't know when
And the night of the crash, I thought it was the end
All it takes is a moment to alter a life
And I thought about that for the rest of the night
Am I makin' a difference with things that I write?
Just a human, you don't know the demons I fight, so
Another day (Another day), another night (Another night)
Another fucking battle in my mind
A lotta love (Lotta love), a lotta hate (Lotta hate)
A lot who wanna see me unwind

Been feelin' low (Feelin' low), super low (Super low)
And they won't even care til I'm ghost (Yeah)
You say I'm the worst
They say I'm the best
But call me tonight when you get off of work
Got things on my chest
I've been feeling bad for the feelings I have
I know that I'm blessed
Been learning that money just isn't the cure
For feeling depressed, I know I digress
I've been a mess, honestly, I've been a mess
Hate what I think in my head
Act like a friend, then when I need you the most
That's when you leave me on read
Have to pretend, always just have to pretend
Like I don't care what it said
Stuck in my head, plenty of things I could do
I just go lay in my bed, damn
Don't really know why I'm feelin' so low (Low)
Where do you go when there's nowhere to go? (Go)
They talk and they talk and I know they don't know (Know)
What it's like when your heart becomes empty and cold
How do I know what's real when my mind questions all I know?
How do I save myself from myself when I'm feelin' low?
How do I flip the page if I'm stuck reading what I've wrote?
Why do I always drown in my thoughts? Need to learn to float!
Another day (Another day), another night (Another night)

Happier,If You Don't Like the Story Write Your Own,https://open.spotify.com/album/1rKIT2C7BONrvYegtGjeAp,2022,1079004,"Hold the pain, keep it silent
Hold the pain, keep it silent
No, my time only runnin' out
'Bout the way that I'm smilin'
Can nobody see I'm down?
Do my best to be okay
But that's all my feelin's allow
These thoughts slip from me always
All I think is how
Now nothin' feels the same
No, nothin' feels the same
Searching for where I belong
I just wanna be happier
Now, nothin' feels the same
No, nothin' feels the same
Learning from where I went wrong
I just wanna be happier (Yeah), yeah
The more I learn, the more I realize how much I have left to learn
Remember back when seven fifty an hour was all I earned
And Mom was workin' overtime, just tryna make things work
So every bill that came in the mail came with concern
I thought maybe a degree could change some things for her and me
Was even honored by the dean, that didn't matter at all
I bought the lie they sold to me at the expense of my own dreams
Said they had everything I need, just need to pay for it all
Well, fuck that
They used to tell me, ""Fuck rap, you need to take a step back
Look in the mirror, Mark, and look at yourself""
They almost had me thinkin' I should put my dreams on the shelf
They don't believe in me just like they don't believe in themselves
I took that chip and then I wore it proudly
Along the way I became fixated on those who doubt me
Somehow lost sight of all the blessings that were all around me
I let comparison and pressure almost fuckin' drown me
Was lost until I found me
I treated the world like it owed me
My self-worth came from comments from people that didn't know me
Feelin' lonely, feelin' like I let everybody else down
Barely recognizin' anyone now, and all I think is-
All I think is how
Now nothin' feels the same
No, nothin' feels the same
Searching for where I belong
I just wanna be happier
Now, nothin' feels the same
No, nothin' feels the same
Learning from where I went wrong
I just wanna be happier
I wanna partake in this rat race, don't have a lot but have faith
And how can I create when my mind is in such a bad place?
I finally made some money, but more issues is what that made
Remember thinkin' that I'll be happy once I reach that place
But not so much, I did it, I felt the rush
But on the way, I left some people and things I love in the dust
That's when I finally realized how now enough is never enough
I wear the smile on my face and nobody has called my bluff
I'm honest, I may have added some commas
But what's naïve to think that money could alleviate problems
I let the numbers become all the validation I seek
Now I know showin' my emotions doesn't mean that I'm weak
Despite what others may think
And maybe all along happiness was a choice
And I listened to their opinions instead of my inner voice
The old me just really wanted the world to love and respect me
Now I'm sick of livin' life for everybody except me
So don't text me, all I want is to fuckin' live in the moment
Should appreciate the journey a little more and I know it
Kept around the ones I trust and cut everybody else out
Barely recognizin' anyone now, and all I think is-
All I think is how
Now nothin' feels the same
No, nothin' feels the same
Searching for where I belong
I just wanna be happier
Now, nothin' feels the same
No, nothin' feels the same
Learning from where I went wrong
I just wanna be happier

Hometown,If You Don't Like the Story Write Your Own,https://open.spotify.com/album/1rKIT2C7BONrvYegtGjeAp,2022,1186350,"Yeah, remember how the music sounded under streetlights on late night drives
And how the moon would illuminate the passenger side
It's twenty to five, I just passed Deepwood Drive
I wish I knew then I was livin' in my simpler times
Sometimes I'd walk around Nevers, headphones on in the rain
'Cause songs always sounded better than the thoughts in my brain
See, last year taught me how much in a year things change
When I'm in town now and look around, nothin's the same, damn
I don't know what they even mean when they're tellin' me I need to come home
Feels like yesterday I packed the car with everything that I own
Know myself less than I know those roads
But my hometown no longer feels like home
I'm back in town, just not for long
The only time that I come back is to visit my mom
I traded oak and maple trees for a couple palms
Remember back when I would rap songs at Tyler and Sean's
Their downstairs felt like Madison Square
There was prolly never more than three or four of us there
Nobody cared, but we never cared
I guess I always knew the thief of happiness is when you start to compare
Now I'm in town, and feel like a tourist
This is where my mom and dad had their first mortgage
This is where my dad passed, not to sound morbid
Lately learnin' that the little things are more important
Places I would visit daily now are so different
My old house no longer even looks lived in
I can't get back all the holidays I've been missing
You really don't know what you miss until you're at distance
Until you, ugh, now
I don't know what they even mean when they're tellin' me I need to come home
Feels like yesterday I packed the car with everything that I own
Know myself less than I know those roads
But my hometown no longer feels like home
Mom's talkin' 'bout movin' now out of state
Lookin' for a place that has a little more space
So I may not be comin' back, and that's somethin' I need to face
All the memories we made here are slowly startin' to fade
And my mom got remarried, she says she's changin' her name
And my sister got engaged, and she plans on doin' the same
I'll be the last one in my family with my family name
Now who the fuck is even family? Guess the question remains, 'cause
I don't know what they even mean when they're tellin' me I need to come home
Feels like yesterday I packed the car with everything that I own
Know myself less than I know those roads
But my hometown no longer feels like home
I don't know what they even mean when they're tellin' me I need to come home
Feels like yesterday I packed the car with everything that I own
Know myself less than I know those roads
But my hometown no longer feels like home
All these photos are moments frozen in time
They teleport me to a place I can only see in my mind
Remember summer nights, chasin' our whiskey down with some wine
And in the winter, how the air would combine with the smell of pine
Remember sittin' at the park all alone with a broken heart
In my car spendin' hours just starin' up at the stars
Back when validation came from a friend, and not from a chart
I cherish where I'm from from afar, damn",https://open.spotify.com/track/68GcWeq73AM4X6z009LjIg,218,charlesaznavour

Creatures lie here looking through the windows
Monster, there are voices
In the darkness, and they say they won't go (yeah)
Stare long enough at the abyss and it seems to start to stare back at you
Lost inside my head, it's a scary place I've adapted to
Friends and family call and I tell 'em that, ""I'll get back to you""
Too busy on my phone, doom scrollin', spent the afternoon
Stressed out, head down, can barely leave my bed now
I hate thеse fucking feelings, they tell mе to try these meds out
But Doc, we've only talked for like ten minutes, I'm sketched out
Paranoid, can't tell if these people are foes or friends now
You know what it feels like to feel like nobody can help?
I talk but that I feel like you're losing yourself
I wouldn't even wish my enemies the hand I was dealt
Thought I could pave the paint to fame with some material wealth
But tears fallin' in the Tesla, I guess it's kind of ironic
Could feel so fucking broke inside somethin' I always wanted
My demons came to play, it feels like my brain they be hauntin'
Hate myself sometimes as much as they hate on me to be honest
I saw Fentanyl take the life away from my cousin
I watched alcohol steal the life away from my dad
I came from nothing, now I'm scared that might be what I'm becomin'
Look in the mirror, barely recognize the one lookin' back, so
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here looking through the windows
Monster, there are voices
In the darkness, and they say they won't go
Wrote a song when my dad passed, and they said it was trash
That made me wish that I put less of myself into every track
I know you can't just burn the orchard when one apple is bad
But the fact of the matter is that I feel I'm startin' to crack
And they say, ""Don't take it to heart"", well, how the fuck do I not?
When I put my soul inside somethin' and they say it's a flop
Constantly tear my art apart when this is all that I got
They wanna see me on a stage or me left in a grave to rot
I've been overstressin' 'bout overstressin'
I lie in bed and think about this life I'm manifestin'
Yeah, my depression's always yellin' that I'm destined for regression
Sad obsession with progression, still they think that I'm just desperate for attention
Broke dead about around this time, just last fall
At therapy tellin' my therapist I feel so small
Pushed everyone I love away, and fuck, it's all my fault
Is it better to feel like this or to feel nothin' at all?
I turned the lights down lonely
Remember back when we were cashing cans at the grocery?
Right there when I was drowning, but they're first to say, ""You know me""
So sick of people saying that they care and never show me
My grandpa once told me that inside an empty mind is where the devil likes to play
And everyday it's all the same, I just stare at an empty page
Ruminatin' 'bout all the things that are piled up on my plate
Time I take control of my brain, no, I can't just pray this away, so
Monster, how should I feel?

It hurts too much to be left alone
I know I was never in your plans
It doesn't feel right in her bed
It hurts to know
Yeah, if only I knew to love you, I would lose me
Or wake up just to go back asleep
I hope you and him live happily
But the memories, girl, you gon' have to keep
All the lies that you told me are on repeat
I don't know what's real, you lied through your teeth
If I could take the feelings that I have for you
Just like our pics, I'd press delete
I've been contemplating a hundred times
About a hundred facts I found out were lies
I know you used me just to pass the time
But you could never say I didn't fucking try
What you meant to me is what I mean to art
Was real with you from the fuckin' start
You played games with my fuckin' heart
And after you, I fell a-fuckin'-part, damn
I know we weren't perfect
I guess I thought we were worth it
I guess your love was uncertain, you're busy at the club flirting
Friends just keep feeding you bourbon
Car smelling like his cologne and your weed
For months I would think, ""Is he better than me?""
I know that he can't love you better than me
I wonder, was it your intention to cheat?
Can't believe I believed you
Keep telling myself I don't need you
When talking to her, I just see you
Alone, but surrounded by people
Maybe one day you'll change and he'll reap the benefits
'Cause all you left me were questions and pain
Don't know why I care if you're feeling the same
I need to just get you up out of my brain (It hurts to know)
I know I was never the plan
You're not the you you would claim
You're not the person I met
Don't know the you you became
Was addicted though to the pain
And the constant games that you play
Just being real when I say that still (It hurts to know)
And I tried to give you a chance
But things were never the same
I ended up all alone
You ended up with a lame
Was addicted though to the pain
And the constant games that you play
Just being real when I say that still (It hurts to know)
It doesn't feel right with you gone (Gone, gone)
It hurts too much to be left alone ('Lone, 'lone)
I know I was never in your plans (Plans, plans)
But it doesn't feel right in her bed (Bed, bed)
It hurts to know
Still, you're who my family adores
Maybe that's why it's hard to ignore you
After all of the time that we spent
Sad to think that I still didn't know you
Woke up in a city that we've never been to
I wish I could show you
Even my music, I put it below you
Just know I would had done anything for you (It hurts to know)
Remember I told you I felt inadequate
Because you came from a family with money
And me, I have nothing, I work as a waiter
With visions of turning myself into something
The music was buzzing but I couldn't pay for a bill
Off of people just saying they love it
Had class in the morning, had work in the evening
Then write through the night with no food in my stomach
Just know that it's hard
Damn, girl, it's so fucking hard
I keep telling myself that I need to move on
But it's hard to get close when you have up a guard
I know everything changed, the old me would prolly feel shame
For the bottles I've bought on my card
You would go to the bar while I was stuck working the double
To pay for the tank in my car (It hurts to know)
And I guess that it's best I pretend like I don't give a fuck
Even though, to be real, I'm a mess
I've been trying to find anything I can find
Just to fill in the hole in my chest
And it's sad to believe that a picture with me
Is a picture of you and an ex
You should know that it takes everything within me
To delete when I'm sending a text, like
It doesn't feel right with you gone

I had fell asleep with the TV on
I said ""Hey, you good?""
There was a brief pause
Then you said to me, ""He's fucking gone""
And my hands are shaking, my mind is racing
My heart is aching, don't know what to say
So I said the first thing that came to mind
Which was something like, ""You're gonna be okay""
""You're gonna be okay?"" What a foolish phrase
Like your whole life's not about to change
And your only options are to sit in pain
Or become so numb, you can't feel a thing
And the days will change, but they'll feel the same
You wanna run away, but you can't escape
Going nowhere fast down the interstate
Only say all that 'cause I know the pain
And to feel like you wanna disappear
I hope you know that I'm always here

You don't have to hurt alone, hurt alone

We don't have to talk if the words don't help
You don't have to hurt alone, hurt alone
I can't fix it, but you won't be by yourself
Yeah, I used to think, ""Damn, I wish I had a fam,"" until I realized that I had two
There's the one assigned to me out the womb, and the one that I got to choose
So know that you're fam to me, and for family, there's not much that I wouldn't do
Been losing your sanity, understandably, and the only way out's to go through
But they say you grow through what you go through
The truth is that I owe you
You were my lifeline in my dark times
Now it's my turn to console you
Even though I know the truth is nothing will
This trauma's gonna take some time to heal
I know the war of losing someone close
Still, I'll never know the way you truly feel, damn
But if you need to vent, or not be alone in your head
Just name the time and the place, I'll be on my way, I'm not one to just leave you on read
'Cause that's what you do for your friends and people you love
You don't let 'em drown when they wanna give up
And trust me, I know how hard it can be finding someone you can trust, but
You don't have to hurt alone, hurt alone
I can't fix it, but you won't be by yourself
And I know I'll never know, never know
What you've been through, all the messed up things you felt
But I could stay down, heavy in the pain, no
We don't have to talk if the words don't help
You don't have to hurt alone, hurt alone
I can't fix it, but you won't be by yourself
Don't know if you've ever thought of trying therapy
It's helped me find a little clarity
Been learning not to care about opinions from people who won't be there when they bury me
I was so desperate, I booked a session
Clicked the first place Google recommended
Someone answered and asked me a couple questions
Told her, ""Ma'am, I can't fix this depression""
I don't want attention, wanna run away
Said she couldn't see me 'til the 28th
That was twenty days, was thinking, ""Oh, okay, that's a lot of time when you're about to break""
I was about to break, I needed fucking help
I couldn't do it all by my-fucking-self
Hate the stigma put on my mental health
Society taught me how to hate myself
But I'm still breathing
Still speaking, heart still beating
Countless nights battling with demons
And I'm still here, guess I'm undefeated
And I was thinking, this could help
Maybe in my story you can find yourself
Hard to understand the hand that you were dealt
You don't owe shit to anyone except yourself
Yeah, accept yourself, know he's looking down
And just like me, know he's fucking proud
Your anxiety is gonna chop you down
Until you start believing that you let him down
But never let it win, the battle starts within
It's where you go from here, not where you begin
It's a blessing to call you a friend, and to know that you let me in, so

See, I'm just a man, I bleed and it's red
Been tryin' to quiet the voice in my head
Too weak to repeat all the things that it says
You're destined to slip when you live on the edge
And I'm doin' my best, but it's never enough
It's always, ""Hey, when you gon' follow this up?""
I give 'em so much of myself, my art, my soul
There isn't much left in my cup
Not prayin' enough, don't know who to trust
Don't follow for follow, I follow my gut
There is no more room for discourse anymore
It's: ""I'm right and you're wrong, and agree or shut up""
What in the fuck? When will we learn?
Together we grow, and divided we burn
There's over seven billion of us on Earth
And here I am talkin' 'bout puttin' me first
And all of my hurt, like anyone cares
I have a tendency to overshare
Crazy to look at a sea full of people
And still feel like there isn't anyone there
As everyone stares, I swear that I'm fine
Tears streamin' outta both of my eyes
They love to see all this raw and real emotion
So they can upload it online
This story is mine, they took and rewrote it
They'll do anything for a click and they post it
But never with credit, my art has been lessened to trends
While people pretend like they own it
Okay, duly noted, things change in due time
Things that I wanted all losin' their shine
Now all I want is to text, or to talk to my dad
But know I'll never get a reply
And that weighs on my mind, not tryin' to harp
But I have to live with this hole in my heart
And maybe the only real way that I know how to cope
Is by losin' myself in the art
I said things that were harsh and I never meant
I let discontent really mess with my head
So many things that I wish I had done and had said
Before I never saw him again
Time that I make amends and pull back the curtain
I barely was there, even when he was hurtin'
And I think of that, I think, ""Damn, what a terrible son""
And I question myself as a person
A human still learnin'
Huh
Just a human still learnin' (uh-uh)
Know I'll never be perfect
That's the only thing certain, yeah
Someone mentioned the music was savin' their life, they relate to it so much it hurts
And I thought to myself, ""I'm so glad I could help, but it's you who put in all the work""
So don't give me credit 'cause I'm just a human who loses himself in his words
I wonder if Steve ever thought that one day we'd be treatin' an app like a church
And hold up these content creators and athletes and artists as if they were gods
Until we decide they no longer have value, then they're thrown away and forgot
See, honestly, all that we are is a sum of our vices, our fears, and our flaws
And then at the end, we end up in a box and can't bring anything that we bought
All the things that we're not make us who we are
Nobody thought I would make it this far
Used to shoot for the sky 'til I realized that it had been proven
That humans are made out of stars
I spill out my heart, it's all that I know
Never been good at just lettin' shit go
Do you know how it feels to sink all that you have in your craft
And still feel like there's nothin' to show?
This here is a poem, a letter, a song
I don't know where in the fuck I belong
There's nothin' more lonely than bein' surrounded by people
Yet all of your people are wrong
I feel like a pawn, I feel like I'm trapped
There's people I miss I can never get back
But been learnin' that life's not about how much water we have
It's about how we look at the glass, that's a lot to unpack, yeah
Dan said, ""Jump on a track, give 'em all that you have,"" yeah
Ever since, I don't know what it's like to hold back, yeah
When the story's authentic, you don't need to act, yeah
Never needed to act, yeah
There's concepts I need to explore, and feelings I can't just ignore
Who cares what you do, who you doin' it for?
Oh, my, how the tables have turned
Since I used to serve food that I couldn't afford
Mom and Dad got divorced, Mom just got remarried
For most of my life thought commitment was scary
But now I don't know, some places you can't take a road

Feels like I'm always waitin'
I need you to come get me
Out of my head, and into your arms tonight, tonight
Yeah, I don't mean to make you wait
Just the pressure's been gettin' heavy
I know if I fuck us up, we'll be over, done, you'll forget me
Forget me, I'm feelin' bad that I act this way, 'cause you let me
They call me king, but I know my queen will be there to check me

Last night, was ridin' down Rodeo lookin' for no ho
It's crazy what can change in a year, think that you know though
Go back and forth like a yo-yo, they live their life for the photos
They see me, I'm actin' solo, 'cause I'm afraid to commit
Now, can you tell me how I'm different than him, and him, and him?
Yeah, I know I'm always questionin' things, like, girl
Would you say that love cannot be found inside a vow or a ring?
She laughs and says, ""Only material things
Those are material things, imagine buyin' all my trust with a ring
Imagine spendin' all my love on a fling, got a thing for you

Yeah, I don't mean to make you wait or to contemplate about us
My ex, she loved to lie, guess that's why it's harder to trust
I been searchin' to find myself and not get too lost into lust
I heard once that you can try, but can't fill from an empty cup
That's no lie, and all I ever say is how I need time
If it was up to you now, you would be mine
I'm on the road more than I'm home
And still I find it's only you on my mind
The last three were gemini, I take that shit as a sign, it's funny
You can't buy time with your money
And you love goin' to the beach whether it's cloudy or sunny
And you love drinkin' all your wine until it hurts in your tummy
You call me, ""Honey, I'm tipsy
And really all I want is for you to love me""
Flashbacks to backroads drivin' back to my side of state
I know I need to tell you, I care before it's too late
Before someone steps to the plate, before you decide not to wait
Before you decide not to chase, then you call me up, just to say
""I'm out of my head, out of my mind, oh, I
If you let me, I'll be

Last Letter,Last Letter,https://open.spotify.com/album/1BpKgHKJFd1qx6wpYjHs9M,2017,24517939,"I miss, I mi—, I miss you
Eh, fuck it!
This might be the hardest song I've ever had to write
Yeah, I dreamt about you last night
I only see you when I close my eyes tight
Yeah, I wish I told you how I felt before you left
But it just never felt right
Yeah,
♪
I wish I told you everything before you left
I won't forget the day that they found the growth in your chest
The cancer took ahold of your body and then it spread
I talk to you more now than I ever did—I'm a mess
This song will never capture the pain that I could express
I learned from you that nothing is perfect, but try your best
I know you had your demons that younger me didn't get
And out of all our demons, our biggest might be regret
Relate more than ever, remember back when I would only see you every other week
And every other Wednesday, you would take us out to eat
Mom and you had split, so we're living in between
Looking up the word ""divorced"" to understand what it could mean
But I don't understand, Mom is with another man
You been drinking heavier than me, wish just another can
Culture full of broken homes, we were just another fam
Coulda left like other dads, you, you had another plan
So you stuck around, dealt a life that you probably would never choose
You bottled it inside and that bottle turned into booze
The Jäger took ahold and your body took the abuse
But finally found some pride and cried when I got the news
I know, been hurting more than I show
Inspired by your story, couple things you should know
I met this girl at my show, teared up by what I was told
She said, ""I'm sober 'cause of you, you do way more than you know""
And I say
And I say, ""Ohh, please grant me the serenity
To accept everything I cannot change""
You, you always told me I had to do anything
To have you back, see you one day
I, I wonder if you see me when I fall, yeah
I wonder if you hear me now at all
Maybe if the world played this through speakers
I'd be loud enough to reach you, and you'll hear
My last letter for you
And I don't understand how you would stay so optimistic
You started chemo, fought the battle, never quit
That really left an imprint
And we would talk about our lives and after this
How we would live 'em different
See, Mom and you would put your differences aside
Every day she would visit, see the love and your vision
See the hurt in your smile, your wisdom is what I'm missing the most
I'll never be ready to let you go
I never felt so helpless inside a boat I control
You told me how you wanted to travel, next year you'll go
And your body had become fragile, not once that you lose your soul
We were told, it was progressing and you had less than a week
True love is every tear when we told you we had to leave
And how we would converse it, not once did we need to speak
That one day in late October you passed away in your sleep
I been cryin' when I think about it
I miss your smile, miss your laugh, and now I live without it
I told you music was my passion, and you never doubt it
And people tell me they relate, but now I truly doubt it
Remember cryin' on your grave and yellin' up to you, ""How did I lose my way?""
I won't forget that summer was some of my darkest days
Was asking for a sign, sat in my tears and prayed
When I saw that sign you sent me, that day was forever changed
I know, I know, I should've been a better me
Oh, blame me when we argue, I said things I didn't mean
Me and you are who I wish, you should have always been between
So I'm sorry for the lack of communication from me
I just wish that you were here, so you could watch me win a Grammy
But more importantly to build a family
I hope I make you proud and become everything I can be
I hope they play it loud and send this letter where I can't reach
Sincerely, Mark
And I said, ""Ohh, please grant me the serenity
To accept everything I cannot change""
You, you always told me I had to do anything
To have you back, see you one day
I, I wonder if you see me when I fall, yeah
I wonder if you hear me now at all

Lately (feat. Dia Frampton),I Could Not Plan This,https://open.spotify.com/album/4dR2U031e2XkziQH53khB9,2017,11881971,"Yeah
Lately I've been reminded, they say time's of the essence
You pulled me deep from the trenches, I guess we're here for confessions
And lately, I been reminded that love is patient and blind
I can write a million lines and never find the words to define us
I know it's best not to rush
I know you're unsure if you're worth, I know how deep that can cut
He broke you down, so you don't feel much, there's forty thousand strings
Holding back our past precautions not often I let you in
It's not often you let me in, I get it, I mean why would you to
Take a chance on me? Then I get, I mean why should you?
'Cause me, I'm just a waiter with lucid dreams of the music
And you, you could find any guy, open mind in a student
I say it, in case we lose it, I hope that that never happens
I know our love runs deeper than just lust and attraction
I guess it's all the little things lately that make me think
I remember nights by the beach and us laughin' 'til we can't breathe
Or that CVS down the street, I don't know if you would agree
But I think...
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better
Old flames still burn like new
Sometimes they're hard to sever
And these walls don't lie, all they speak is truth
In this empty room, all I see is you
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better
Lately I've been reminded that love is all that is timeless
The pain you paint on your face, I see strength behind both your eyelids
And lately I've been reminded, I'm flawed, and nobody's perfect
The distance isn't easy, but nothin' is when it's worth it
I'm workin' to bring you all that I sense the weight that you carry
I wish you would let it all out and trust me, because I can't see
I wish you wouldn't compare me, he loved you without your clothes
But no, he's never seen you naked, never seen into your soul
And I love the way I see your mind, wonder when I get deep with you
I wonder why you cry when I tell you that I believe in you
I wish that I could take away the pain of how he treated you
My favorite nights were nights when it felt like it were just me and you
Damn, and if you ever cannot stand me
I hope that I made an impact and showed your heart what love can be
Envision us with a family, envision us where it's sandy
I feel you bringing me close, they in love with lovin' what can be
I know...
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better
Old flames still burn like new
Sometimes they're hard to sever
And these walls don't lie, all they speak is truth
In this empty room, all I see is you
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better
I think about the nights you cried as you reminisce on your parents
And the way you know that money can't buy love as a parent
You're self conscious of your ears, your head's always down when you wear it
And you I never drink when I'm soggy drunk it's apparent
I know, I just love watchin' you grow, you feel the weight on my soul
I always mess with a ten, I'm always hot when you're cold
And if they told us our love was just for a season
I want you to know I loved you, I gave my all and I mean it
I know...
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better
Old flames still burn like new
Sometimes they're hard to sever
And these walls don't lie, all they speak is truth
In this empty room, all I see is you

Just one look into your eyes
Can change my mind
Then again, I don't mind
I seem to find
All the answers to the questions I don't like
But you make them all alright
Yeah!
I often wonder what really it is that you offer me
At least I feel your touch, even if it's just when you walk on me
Your mind is always elsewhere, it's there, it's on, then it's off of me
I want to feel your depth, but your heart is deaf when you talk to me, uh
I guess that's what we were taught
We open up depending on how many drinks we have bought
He wants your head and it's ironic, doesn't care 'bout your thoughts
You're one more drink away from drowning, feeling empty and lost
But me, I'm no better, she wants to fuck around and I let her
A culture now of ""We're together,"" but was never together
I know you're looking for one night and I've been stuck on forevers
I think it's sad that I'm naive to think that we could do better, but fuck it
I should've known from the start
And even after all this time, I still don't know who you are
There's more to life than likes and hoppin' bars and gettin' high inside your car
You're feeling distant, feeling far, your wall is up, I know it's hard, and so
Tell me something only you know
Give me reason not to go
You have my heart
If I have yours, then let me know
And tell me something only you know
You have feelings you don't show
So how am I supposed to know
If you love me, let me know
Let me know
Let me know
I often wonder what really it is that I offer you
At least you feel my touch, even if it's just when I walk on you
My mind is always elsewhere, it's there, it's on, then it's off of you
You want to feel my depth, but my heart is deaf when I talk to you, uh
A viscous game that we play
See, nowadays, they say love and hate are one in the same
You let me beat around the bush, until you're sick of my games
It's never fair because you cared and I just transfer the blame
I transfer my pain, a shame to know that you could do better
How selfish, is it my concern as if I'm making you wetter
How selfish, is it you just want me 'cause I make you feel better
And we just chop it up to being drunk, that's wine on your sweater
Alone but together, we always make it less than it seems
It's funny how if you have feelings, you're weak, so we say less than we mean
You hate waiting, we're not dating and not vocal
We're game-playin', I hate sayin', but still hopeful
I'm conflicted, I'm lost in a lot of women
I know our situation's been sticky since the beginning
She left me out in limbo, you deal with my indecision
Don't know if you'll ever love me or love the talent I'm given, but fuck it
I should've known from the start
How can I feel so fucking lonely with your hands on my heart?
Your hands on my chest, you whisper, ""What do you want to do next?""
Our generation's taken love out of sex, and so the question is left
Tell me something only you know
Give me reason not to go
You have my heart
If I have yours, then let me know
And tell me something only you know
You have feelings you don't show

I pray to God I'll be over-great
Not another wack rapper that they overrate
Y'all spoiled like the South in the Florida State
I'm always overworked and never overpaid
But I prayed for it, yeah
And when they told me that I couldn't, man, I had to find a way for it, yeah
Serve a table everyday, had to find a way to pay for it, damn
And when I started goin' numb is when I realized I was made for it, yeah
So it's ""fuck all my feelings,"" I feel like the villain
Feel like I overstepped boundaries, feel like you're better without me
Feel like I'm drowning, feel like I never had found me
I don't want no one around me
I don't think nobody knows how it feels when there's so many people yet no one to listen
I try to good with the talent I'm given
I try to see clear, yet attention's been blockin' my vision
Surrounded by fake—and, honestly—lately, debate how much more I can take
A couple more shots to the face
I often don't drink, so I'm searching for something to chase
She's putting my hands on her waist
Her tongue's in my mouth and I wonder what pain she can taste
I'm taking caffeine when I'm wake and tired of taking the pill with PM just to sleep when it's late, I dont
I don't know what to believe in
Did it all for the wrong reasons
And now I'm picking up the pieces
Of that person, I was more
I've been losing you, you
You, you
I've been losing you
I guess I've lost me for a while, well, welcome back
Lately I've forgot how a smile felt, now picture that
Thought that I could buy happy
Maybe buy a new car in all black
Put the whole entire team on the map
Everything I have now, had to work for all that
But, to see my dad again, I would give it all back
They just want me to rap
I feel like a slave to this shit
I know that I pray for this shit
But if I have one more fake convo with one more fake person, I might just go ape in this shit
Remembering back, we had no place to live
And you spent my rent money on clothes that you wear
And confusing your Instagram followers for people who care
And you'll never find happy when stuck in comparin', I know
I miss the feeling of feeling feelings
Now every song I write I've been dripping and oozin' real, and
I try to tell my story, yeah, feelin is less appealin'
Them rappers that like to mumble and already hit the ceiling, so fuck
Didn't fuck with me way back then, now it's ""Hey, what's up?""
Is it weird that I still feel stuck?
Think it's funny when I spill my guts 'cause I feel?
Feelin' like I need to stop playing, he's real
I spent last week in bed and the weekend was drunk
'Cause I honestly just couldn't deal
It's been seven days now without you, that makes one week
You turn into someone else after just one drink
Wonder if I'm on your mind when you think
And, honestly, I tried to help you find you—and instead lost me
I don't know what to believe in
Did it all for the wrong reasons
And now I'm picking up the pieces
Of that person, I was more

I just heard that my old girl got somebody new and is pregnant
I spent my time just forgettin'
I spent my time on the music and travel the country
Those last couple lines, I've been said it
Last night I took a ride around my old town
Was the last time I felt somethin' for the first time
I took a ride by my old house
'Cause that's where I fell in love for the first time
Thinkin' back, December when I saved every penny that I made
Knew I'd be the greatest, I just gotta find a way
I couldn't even buy food from the place that I work
'Cause the food cost more than the pay that I made
And they told me I would never be shit
Run around in town, ""Am I meant to be shit?""
Always had a vision, and they never see shit
Wrote my first line, Witty is the meanest
So there back, get some receipt, people, while I work at the movies
Girls hit me up, now used to look through me
Sayin' I'll change, yeah, you never knew me
But maybe they're right, I just hope I don't lose me, now I'm
Wishin' I could rewind time
Want you back in my room, like I do with a movie
Broke up my heart and my soul many times now
You could see right through me
And when I fell down, you were never around
Now you need me, oh, you need me now? Please
Wishin' I could rewind time
Want you back in my room, like I do with a movie

Could see right through me (movie)
Could see right through me (movie)
You could see right
I just heard that my other ex-girl is engaged to be married
I think commitment is scary
Maybe that's why it just didn't work out for us
When you show someone your soul, do you ever stop carin'?
Sometimes I wish I could just rewind time
Want to change anything, want to relive moments
Even if I know we wouldn't work out, that's fine
When the first door closes, another one opens
Told me I was hopeless
Now the same people hit me up, I never noticed
Every minute that you spent hatin' on me
Was another minute that I spent workin' on my own shit, had to stay focused
Never could've hoped it, never could've planned it
'Til you feel like you have nothing, you would never understand it
Complements are always backhanded
I see people lookin' for a handout, I could never fuckin' stand it
I just make anthems
And spill out my soul on these pages
Was meant for whenever was random
Used pain as a paint for this painting
I just miss what could've been, but I should just water my grass
And not worry about if the grass will be greener
Damn, it's also ironic
I wrote my first lines while I worked at the theatre, now I'm
Wishin' I could rewind time
Want you back in my room, like I do with a movie
Broke up my heart and my soul so many times now
You could see right through me
And when I fell down, you were never around
Now you need me, oh, you need me now? Please
Wishin' I could rewind time
Want you back in my room, like I do with a movie

That turns into sexting, my mind you've been testing
The one thing I lack is a lack of affection
See, just like my math, I've been stackin' my exes
You ain't the one, since you I've been sippin' in some
And you and him ain't everything that you wish that he was
You hit Witt and then quit, so in the long run
You just fuck with my feelings for fun, say it!
You love me right now, well, then prove it to me!
""I promise I'm different,"" That's hard to believe
'Cause you talk, talk, talk, never walk, walk, walk
Guess a lame motherfucker is all you gon' be
Never want to be surface, I swim in the deep
Man, I swim in the deep
Hate on my music, hate on my concepts
Honestly, this is just me being me
So fuck your opinion, I stick to my vision
Makin' this music and all the decisions
I'm sorry, fake friends—I was always too driven
That caused a division, you hate but still listen, it's funny
Rappin' 'bout money makes money
Nowadays everybody wantin' something from me
You stealin' my style, gon' have to tear it from me
I would never dumb it, dumb it down for you dummies, ugh
Tried to make everybody happy
That was my biggest mistake
I could show you how I feel
Yo, get the fuck up out my face
I'ma blow, run the show
That's something I fuckin' know
I do this all on my own
And the only way we goin' is up
I won't stop for nothing, I say
Yeah, I'ma do this on my own and now I'm
Sick and tired of running away
And the only way we going is up
What you hidin' behind that YouTube icon?
Wait until they kill that YouTube icon
Tried to make everyone happier, was I wrong?
People wanna see you fail when you've givin' your all
Waste days if you wordy, but talk's fake
Whole life in the copy-paste
Talkin' 'bout my mistakes, I guess you can't relate
To the path that I shoulda take
It piss you off that I tatted my face
But like I promised that it's real, I'm not fake
You see the hate's just a part of the fame
You see my purpose as a part of the change
You been stuck in your ways, I been riding the wave, yeah!
So many things I've been dyin' to say
What's it take to see what's goin' on in my brain?
I'm doin' well, so I can't complain; I took the pain
And made it art that y'all see it today
You don't like it? You can fuck yourself!
And give opinion to someone else
I made the best of the hand I was dealt
People that talk the most can't handle themself
So you hear about it's annual wealth
Your bad vibes gon' damage your health
Lost in your pride and never asked for help
Look into my eyes and see what they reveal
I'ma be a legend, I promise that for real, yeah
Tried to make everybody happy
That was my biggest mistake
I could show you how I feel
Yo, get the fuck up out my face
I'ma blow, run the show
That's something I fuckin' know
I do this all on my own

I won't stop for nothing, I say
Yeah, I'ma do this on my own and now I'm
Sick and tired of running away
And the only way we going is up
And I can't wait to go read all your comments
Like, ""Mark only, Mark only talks about girls""
You listened to two songs, man, you are too wrong
Here is my nut for you internet squirrels
I'm spillin' my world, you're spillin' your hate
It's okay, you're a lame motherfucker won't ever relate
I'm a shark in the tank, you're the ship that I sank
I can't rap about money, there's none in my bank
And to think, you'd ever stop hatin'
Biggest mistake was to ever start datin'
That's time that I wasted, no time to be waitin'
I should be at Red Rocks and chillin' with Peyton
I'm waitin' on tables, but waitin' for tables to turn
It's TEAMWITT, motherfucker, 'til death on my urn
Now I'm next to the rest and y'all waitin' your turn
But they want me fail or to crash and to burn, so I
Pour gas on the fire
Motherfuck me? See, your mom is a liar
I'm probably workin' while you go get higher
You lookin' for real, well, see, I'm the supplier
You lookin' for talent, then pray for mitosis, you're hopeless
I'm hopin' you notice, your fan base is fake
And you hope I don't notice you're full of more shit
Than the back of a rodent, go act like you know 'em
Your rappin' is surface, I'm rappin' a poem
A trojan to catch poetry when she blow 'em
I told 'em, we we're gonna get it
Built up a team and a vision and always stick with it
It's funny my style, you bit it
But knowin' how phoney you are, you ain't never admit it
Not hard but go hard when your girl wanna get it
Get hard in the back, of a car do you get it
Don't need your opinion, my life I'ma live it
I told 'em we'd do it and all of us did it
My mind is defined, so my body in tune
I was built in the womb, but my mind on the moon
And I'm locked in my room like a fucking cocoon
When I'm leaving my room, all you rappers are doomed

NEVERS ROAD,NEVERS ROAD,https://open.spotify.com/album/3kIUmStYlCKTlM9eZmN1Nb,2019,3934343,"Yeah
I think about it quite often, I wonder if you can hear me
Sometimes I pick up on signs that you sent to show that you're near me
Sometimes I think about life after death and question the theories
I miss your smile and your voice, I still remember it clearly
I wrote a song called last letter, I put the volume on max
I wonder if you look down on my life and get a good laugh
And then tell Grandma and the others that you're proud you're my dad
I wish I'd cherished every single fuckin' moment we had
Now it's too late
So many things I wish I said, just never had time to say
How can you feel so close from a million miles away
It's crazy what can change in a year, a month or a day
I know I'm flawed and so perfect is somethin' I never claim
They say, the strongest storms show the strongest roots
I always knew that one lie could change a hundred truths
I always cherished when you told me, I believe in you
I hope that you can forgive me for how I treated you
Thinkin' back, I blamed you for all of my fuckin' demons
You drank another bottle, could never fathom the reasons
It took too long to get you the help that you really needed
One day when I win a Grammy, I hold it up, so you see it
I promise, I know you know I'm a man of my word
Lately feelin' less and less adapted to handling hurt
Actin' like they know my fuckin' life 'cause they're fans of my work
Others are nice to get what they want 'cause they're fans of my worth
Can't tell the real from the fake, can't tell the fake from the real
Broken and empty inside, told me in time I would heal
OCD wreckin' my brain, I don't want nothin' the same
Dropped the whole album at once, write it all over again
Write it all over again, write it all over again
Feel like I'm goin' insane, want to feel good for a change
I keep ignorin' the pain, there is nobody to blame
Tell me they love me for me, then they throw dirt on my name, yeah
The darkest nights make the brightest stars
I tell myself that every time I feel like life gets hard
We've come a long fuckin' way since our kindest regards
And still I feel like my whole life is just waitin' to start
I could've lost it all in that crash, the lights flash
It's feelin' like something's jabbed in my back
The car's spinnin', my whole body's cut and covered in glass
And when we stop, I see my stomach slowly turnin' to black
That made me realize my whole life is truly fragile at best
Sometimes I stress until I physically feel pain in my chest
I ruminate, that's like my mind is always stuck on reset
I heard my grandma's fightin' cancer, Mom just sent me a text
I know we always butted heads and never saw eye to eye
But at this rate, I've seen too many in my family die
Apologize for holding grudges, such a waste of my time
So I just wanna say I love you while you're here and alive
Some people don't know the difference of being human and human-being
I'm only lettin' things inside my life, now they give it meaning
I'm only lettin' things inside my mind, now they keep me dreaming
I'm only lettin' things inside my heart, now they keep it beating
That's real
♪
Yeah
Dan told me, jump on this beat and let it all spill
I wonder if I lost it all if they would call still
Some people tend to forget, but I know we all feel
I put my soul on display and that's what they call real
Stop holdin' on, if it's holding you back, then let it go
Your grass will always be the greenest if you let it grow
They said I'll never be anything, guess you never know

Yeah
You were right, said I'd change and never do
Between you and I, think it hurts because it's true
I can't tell you why I put all the blame on you
Then say, ""You decide,"" what the fuck we're supposed to do?
Hate to see you cry and hate more that I'm to blame
When I realize I'm the one that cause you pain
This is real life and you're tired of the games
And you feel like I may never fucking change
When the highs get high and the lows get low
All I know is you're the one I love
As the tide gets higher and the world's on fire
You're the only one I'm thinking of
Put up wall after wall, was terrified to fall
Instead of leaving, you took time to break through
You have friends that are fam, and fam you can't stand
Guess in blood and in love, we don't choose
You say, ""You should try, not just try to win me back""
You disguise all your pain behind your laugh
Been losing sight of the future and the past
Now, who am I? Lately, I've been losing track of who
I wish I could make you love me
I guess so I could feel you hold me
I'm tired, empty, stressed and lonely
Lost on nights like this
The only one I want around me
Can't bear to see your life without me
I'm sorry for the times you found me
Lost on nights like this
Just because we have a heart
Doesn't mean we have a heart
Just because we make mistakes
Doesn't mean that's who we are
Said some shit tonight that I regret
I wanna learn how I can love you best
And just because I hide it well
Doesn't mean it didn't scar
Only time I feel at peace
Is when I lie in your arms
I have angels that I wish you met
And some demons I should keep in check, damn
Can't expect you to save me
I've been lost, haven't talked to my family lately
You know that that ain't me
Just know I love you, have love for the woman that made me
We're under the same stars
And I'm scared you won't love me the same when the day starts
Hate that I play a part
To the hurt in your heart, hear the hurt when you say, ""Mark""
You should try, not just try to win me back""
You disguise all your pain behind your laugh
Been losin' sight of the future and the past
Now who am I? Lately, I've been losin' track of who
I wish I could make you love me
Again so I could feel you hold me

I hate the fact that I feel nothing or I'm reeling in pain
I need to shake this fucking habit, so I try, but I can't
And I look down on other addicts when we're one and the same
Remember back, I'm pushin' twenty, those were simpler times
That's when we met, and ever since you're never far from my mind
I broke my ankle playin' ball, and so it's you I'm prescribed
And even through all of the pain, you make me feel I could fly
A couple weeks, and now you're gone and now I'm feelin' the stress
I always wanted to feel something, maybe nothing is best
My friends and family start to question if I'm feelin' depressed
But I don't really give a damn, just put me back on the meds
I've been lost in my head
My homie Jack said he dealt with the same shit
He said he started drinkin' to deal with the pain quick
All you need is a fifth and it's cool to remain lit
So he handed me a bottle, said, ""Take about eight sips""
I'm faded, but I wanna feel straight numb
So I drink the rest of the bottle, liquor burnin' my gums
Woke up the next day at around a quarter to one
My peers would say that ""Man I had fun, right?""
I've been lyin', I've been sayin' I'm fine
But I've been feeling low and I don't know why
Another night, I feel empty inside
Down bottle after bottle of whatever I find
Feel the weight lift off me
Someone tell my mom I'm sorry
I don't wanna lie, I've been losin' my mind
They tell me ""Take a pill"" until I feel alright
The present day been feelin' sick, think I'm just bidin' my time
I take a shot of somethin' strong to keep that shit off my mind
All my friends started families and they left you behind
And here I am drinkin' any can or bottle I find
My body took you in as blood and so we're never apart
Some real shit, you the closest someone's been to my heart
But just like everything I love, you fuckin' tear me apart
Just like everything I love, you fuckin' tear me apart
I wanna be there for my son, daughter, wife—I mean my ex-wife now
I guess that time really flies when you're drunk on the couch
I wanna shake this fuckin' habit, I just don't know how
So you would love to see me sick until I almost drown
And so you keep me on the brink of barely livin' and death
As long as I'm alive, yeah, you know you're gettin' my cheque
You pray my son and daughter will follow me in my steps
You'll create our loves a fact that I'm broke and broken and in debt
Can go a day without food, I can't go a day without you
When I try, I get the shakes 'til my face turns blue
Lost my job, wife, life for a bottle of booze
You promised you would make me happy, we know that's not true
I tried every drug in the book, but they never hit me the same
I told my doc that I'm down, he put some pills in my name
It doesn't matter the problem, the fix is always the same
Always takin' the easy route, like I'm never willin' to change, damn
Now blamin' everybody but me
With you inside my system, everybody used to love me
But now my friends, family, my kids, they can't even trust me
Been losin' all my control and I let you fuckin' become me
No more! I said no fuckin' more!
I know you think I'm lyin', I said this to you before
This time I'm fuckin' ready, it's time to show you the door
This life is mine, it never was yours!
I've been lyin', I've been sayin' I'm fine
But I've been feelin' low and I don't know why

Phone (feat. Gjan),I Could Not Plan This,https://open.spotify.com/album/4dR2U031e2XkziQH53khB9,2017,16337486,"Seems you know what I want
My mind is full, it's full of you
It doesn't see it, we will ride
Another lie, another fight
Now every night, I tell myself
Stop thinkin' about you and you losin' your money
But every time I'm doin' this
Refusin' it, I'm foolin' myself
Oh, Foolin' myself
Oh, so naive, oh, I couldn't see
This love wasn't meant to be
Tell me why I still keep checkin' my phone
Oh, tell myself, it's not who I am
Understand it wasn't meant to be
Tell me why I still keep checkin' my phone
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Tell me why I still keep checkin' my phone
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Tell me why I still keep checkin' my phone
Hey, Mark, I know you're mad but I thought that maybe you'd answer
So maybe last night was the last time that we'd speak
Remember who was there when your dad was goin' through cancer
Remember who was there when your soul was broken and weak
You see, I took my time with you, you just took me for granted
I juggled with my demons, you never would understand it
So when you said, ""forever,"" I thought about it and panicked
I lie, but when I told you I loved you, I meant it, dammit
I know I was never perfect, and you hatin' me for it
You say the same shit in your songs and have them praisin' you for it
And we were sittin', talk for hours 'bout your music and tourin'
And even though you say you loved me, I was less of important
I know, I hurt way more than I show, it hurts way more than you know
I know I cheated, but you cheated us both
Your trust issues tore a hole at me that you couldn't close
We were distant due to distance, what's different when you were close?
You're different, I hope you know, we argue now over nothin'
I'm goin' out with my friends, all you hear is someone I'm fuckin'
I know you're not gettin' trust, but cut me some fuckin' slack
I wish that night never happened, but sometimes it's still playin' back
I try to ignore the facts, I'm not the person you thought
Now all that's left are moments and every ticket we bought
That means all our heart, bitter, swallow, might wash it down with some shots
So cheers... to what we lost
Oh, so naive, oh, I couldn't see
This love wasn't meant to be
Tell me why I still keep checkin' my phone
Oh, tell myself, it's not who I am
Understand it wasn't meant to be
Tell me why I still keep checkin' my phone
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Tell me why I still keep checkin' my phone
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Tell me why I still keep checkin' my phone
Hey, uh, I got your message, I guess I just wasn't ready
To be honest, since you left everything is pretty unsteady
To be honest, since you left, I barely eat or get ready
I been tryin' to fill this void with anyone who would let me
And I just hate how now we're stuck inside this game
The loser is the one who shows they care, feelin' pain
I'm checkin' if you took down all our pictures, just so I can do the same
Fuckin' petty, wasn't ready for you to just up and change
And I know that you'll only miss me when you fail to replace
Girl, I lived across the map, how could you need more space?
How could you be so fake? See, I was real from the start
Every lie was like a knife that entered straight to the heart
Don't know who you are, how could I when you lied from the start?
You feel empty, so you fill up every night at the bar
I feel empty, but can barely fill the tank in my car
They love you after 3 a.m., but they don't love who you are
I can't lie, honestly I still think about you
And when I go out with my friends, I still drink about you
I'm sorry if I made you question how I feel about you
Put you over everything, but now I have to live without ya, aw, shit
I'm drivin' into a tunnel so I might break up
I promise I would've stayed if there was a way I could save us
If only you spent as much time on us as you do your make up
I tried... and you gave up
Oh, so naive, oh, I couldn't see
This love wasn't meant to be
Tell me why I still keep checkin' my phone
Oh, tell myself, it's not who I am
Understand it wasn't meant to be
Tell me why I still keep checkin' my phone
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Tell me why I still keep checkin' my phone

When the rent due, you don't know what I've been through
When we can't afford lights, I write in the dark with a paper I'm putting my pen to
Try to fuck with my mental, said my potential is minimum wage
Majority die before twenty five, forty years later we're put in a grave
I'm filled up with rage
This is the culture you sent me to save, society stuck in a cage
Remembering back in the day, feeling so real when I ride while I bump Kanye but damn
Real turned into Photoshopped Kim K
Everyday when they wake up, girls cake up on your make up all over their face
They think its okay, they're fucking their way to the top
They see all your money and stare at their waist
They throw up their dinner not knowing you fake
They'll never compare to those pics that you take
And this is the world that you fucking create
A world that your daughter can't even escape
So you were the one that was left to decay
A world in which I have been sent here to save, then 'Ye
I think were on the same page, cause I've been jackin' off to Kim since I was in the fifth grade
You see you show us how to live, but its a fib to get payed
Now Mr. West I got a question, who are the new slaves
See what media made, the pawn of the game is slaved up with T.V and radio playing
I ain't pointing the blame
I ain't pointing the blame, cause it all don't hang on you
I'm a slave of the truth and that's the point that I need you to prove
Well, we're slaved to a label, and its funny that labels are slaved to the youth
So why can't you see all the power in you
Kid from your class couldn't pass but he drew, till it turned into music you're listening to
Now we 're changing the world, motherfucking IQ
Walked in the label like yo what it do
So give me a mil, better off make it two
Creative control in a bowl full of stew
So you can ask Dan he was there with me too
Ugh, I don't like this dude, I ain't signing shit
Ten writers who can barely write a hit
Compare me too, check the writer list
There are images who the industry will use as a fucking tool just to get more hits
Do you get it yet, I'm sick of the lying
Indie when really your signed, making it hard for real indie art like mine
Money don't grow on a tree like pine
Lying to fans, robbing them blind, keeping them buying by keeping them blind
Airing you out it's a matter of time, stuck in a bind you can't buy time
Can't buy time, open your legs and never the mind
You're Looking for head and never inside
We're looking to find attention online
We only see surface we're lame and we're dry
Placing our value in things that we buy
We staring at ass, it's never enough
We're so disconnected from being alive
From being alive, so disconnected from being alive
Take a look in my eyes, then in my soul and see what you find
Yeah I used to get bullied so bad I would sit in my room and I'd cry
Now the same motherfucker like Mark where is the song I could buy
Now open your eyes, human but more like a virus
Greedy is spineless
Take from the earth and we fill it with violence
Take and we take we're the same as a tyrant
Never been silent
Learn what we know from a Facebook post
It's a joke now we're looking so mindless
Stupid we seem to define it
On the same boat, when they think we would sink then we fight it
Love is the only thing timeless
Live in an era where we value weed over love
So you can buy a drug but you can't buy love
So you can buy a bottle but you can't buy grub
So you can buy class doesn't mean you're not dumb
Most the people I know, they would rather feel numb
And so tell me when was the last time you had fun, other then when you fuck and turn up at the club
Man I'm sick of this wack shit, You're faker than Iggy Azalea's accent
You have to live in the past tense, me I'm the future in everything I put to action
What's a rap god to a rapping assassin
No one has mentioned my passion
Power through tinder you're looking for action
Now at the club and you're pounding the captain
Never found passion, living in fraction, lonely and asking what your life could be
Now when life gets hard you don't fight but instead you gon' light the weed
So you spend four years and you work real hard to go get a degree
Now you're working a five nine to five and you're chasing another man's dream
Most of us settle it seems, girl you're worth more than you fucking attempt for the guys
Nothing more precious than time, nothing more tragic then dying while being alive
We look at the sky, know that one day we'll decay in the dirt we let die
I'm here to deliver you all from the lies
And know that I gave you a piece of my, mind",https://open.spotify.com/track/3ycwGAW1B8Pn7ixNzTwH7D,213,charlesaznavour

You talk a lot of shit when you don't even fuckin' know me
A bunch of fuckin' actors, think you all should win a Tony
Said I signed a fuckin' deal, like ""Where, bitch? Show me!""
You became a fuckin' critic 'cause you lack any skill
Tried to make up with your mouth what you lack on the field
You don't even know yourself 'cause you lack being real
If all I rap about is love, then all they rap about is pills
To the man who hit and then ran in that crash
I wanna say: ""Fuck you with every single ounce of fuck that I have""
Karma's comin', hope you're watchin' your back
You keep ignorin' the facts
If passion mattered, I'd be covered in plaques, damn
Only offended if the shoe fits
You lied so much that you don't even know what truth is
I told 'em all from the start ""Trust the blueprint""
TEAMWITT until my motherfuckin' death—that's the movement
Don't want it when I'm on the attack
I might just have to hit up Ninja just to borrow his mats
I might just have to hit up Cloak just to borrow his strats
A bunch of rappers sounding like they just been borrowin' tracks
Used to laugh and poke fun but now the joke's on who?
You push papers for a living, guess the joke's on you
Despite your popular belief, the life you live you choose
And when you sacrifice for love, what do you actually lose?
You talk a lot, but you say the least
The closest you've ever been to a dream is you countin' sheep
You used to count me out, now see the numbers and want a piece
It's sad to know you'll never be the one you pretend to be
I don't do good with might, maybe, should've or probably
All I want is trust, love, fun and some honesty
I've only scratched the surface of the person I wanna be

Can make myself comfy, I'm better off all alone

But fuck it, this'll do, and between me and you
I never planned on leavin' to tell you the damn truth
It's all a part of life, some things you just can't chose
You've never know I exist 'til you're sick and you can't move
It's either me or it's you, it's either you or it's me
I never could be the one you really want me to be

I sleep when you can't sleep, I breathe when you can't breathe
Take a second, let it resonate
I'm in everything you do, each and every day
I'm in everything you do, you were never safe
Yeah, you used to be the one, now you're second place, haha
Already doubled in size
Just give me a couple years, you'll never find me in time

Waste your life away, every day you sit at a cubicle
I've been movin' into some other spots that are suitable
Haha, I hear you clickin' those keys
I hear you talkin' to your doc, got an appointment at three
He's gonna tell you you have cancer—what he means is me
They perceive to tell you things that might make me leave
Geez, slow down! Why are you drivin' so fast?
Oh shit, it's a quarter past, go quick, foot on the gas
Get your ass up in that office, do everything that they ask
They question if you been smokin', don't lie, we know that you have
Deep breath, but you can't breathe

He can't believe what he sees, you can't believe what you see
I feel you're startin' to sweat, I feel the shake in your knees
Damn, I'm sorry that it's too late
He tells you ""Chemo might help,"" but you won't be saved
The next trip we take, it only goes one way
You wasted half your life just so you get paid
And all the money that you made, shit, you can't take
So you leave it in your bank for your grandkid's sake
Been feelin' all of your pain, I feel the way that you ache

A couple months and now we lie in this bed
The chemo didn't work and now I've moved to your head
I see all of your thoughts, you think about being dead
You think about all the things you often wished you had said
Like a couple more ""I love you,"" a couple more ""I trust you""
A couple more nights prayin' to the one above you
You are never gonna be a single person but you
You spent your whole life in the mirror sayin' ""Fuck you!""
Where you gonna run to? I hear the room cryin'
I wish that I could say, ""You'll be okay,"" but I'd be lyin'
Could buy anything, but could never buy time
And it's sad that you only realize when you're dyin', shit
I can feel your lungs weaken
Who knew your last weekend would become your last weekend?
Family's in the room, I wonder what they been thinkin'
I feel your heart, it's so heavy, I feel your temperature's sinkin'
It's time, no one can keep you alive
The human kind make environment's perfect for me to thrive

All about the same girl and the same pain
Now I got two girls with the same name
Wait, I'm feeling myself
See, it's been a whole week, and I can't even tell
Right between going to heaven or going to hell
Feel like I'm stuck in a cell
Told me I'm selling my soul, are you selling yourself?
I feel like I'm walking on shells
What should I tell? Feel like Adele
Feel like my hands in the nail is the way that they want me
Stay quiet and keep to yourself
Maybe we're living in hell
Maybe it's all in our minds, or all a matter of time
You have no vision, you're blind
And lately I'm losing myself, now I'm harder to find
I feel like I'm stuck in a bind
Feel like I'm stuck in a Vine
Looping a day at a time
Wake up, you're working at nine
Why are we told never get out of line?
And why would I think you would ever be mine?
You never gave me a sign
And now you're the one that I'm leaving behind
Running from something that's bigger than I
I'm, so sick of nothing, wanna be something, Sausage McMuffin
Just to ease the pain this morning while my stomach's rumbling
Minimum wage, another day that I can't pay
Nothing's stuck in fucking gray
You eat gourmet, I microwave oven
Running, you're stuck on a leash
Wanna see Spain, and I wanna see Greece
Wanna see things I would never believe
I wanna wake up with a view of the sea
I wanna believe, I wanna achieve
I wanna perceive everything I could be
Perceiving is key, we are what we see
And lately I've been in this rut, now I wanna be free
I don't wanna hold back for you, put it all on my back for you, I
I don't know what's after you, who's after you, who knows?
Lose myself while chasing after you, I only ever got half of you, I

I guess what I wanna say is I feel stuck
I do like a girl with a big butt
I either don't drink or get too drunk
And pass out on my best friend's futon
I need to move on from this basic shit
I wake up, eat, and go and take a piss
You do something fun and have to take a pic
And really life is a movie, go and make a flick
You gotta make a pick, you gotta take a chance
Can't see the world when it's in your hands
And when I first started, it was Ty and Dan
Now it's still us, plus a couple fans
I've been stressing and I've been working hard
Hard is not enough when you regard a star
Been shooting far and only hitting Mars
There is more to life than just girls in bars
There is more to life than just getting by
I know you drink the pain, so you can chase the high
When they say you can't, you gotta question why
You will never understand my plan to drive, damn
Still stuck in this town, think of ""The Lights"" while I'm riding around
I focus on me, I don't care who you found
I'm coming for king, only thing is the crown
I'm tired of feeling so down
They say that I'll make it as soon as I'm found
But fuck being found, I stuck to my morals and ground
I care about my passion, my heart, and my sound
I care about the people here holding me down
My ex was a mess who was messing around
Ignoring your texts, you're irrelevant now
It's over, and now, I'ma run 'til I'm found

Open your mind, you're taking your time
You're taking too long, they're gonna forget you without a new song
It's, kinda funny how the game works
Talk about money, bitches, is paid dirt
And we all end up in the same hearse
So your legacy is really what makes worth, and

Mom always want a divorce
Dad calling mama a whore
Drunk, been drinking all weekend
A couple of coors
A couple of doors are broken
Covered the floor, damn
So he's told never to tell
If anybody finds out
He'll be put in a cell
Hit with a belt
There will be nobody to help
And so he prays every day
While he's stuck in this hell
All to himself
He holds every ounce of it in
All the kids who have things
Always laughing at him
All the teacher sees is pain
But he's playing pretend
Playing with friends is something
He wishes he can
But, nobody wants to give him a chance
Nobody wants to be with a man
Been looking in the future
But the future is so far in advance
Looking at the alcohol in his hand
Like damn, like why
Why god
Why do I do this again
And, why am I getting so drunk
See my dad was a drunk
I don't wanna be him
I, I know im searching for feelings
I thought I could find them in bottles of gin
I'm tired of losing my faith
And then looking to fake to replace all my feelings within I

Hoe, slut, stupid, and fake
She doesnt know how much she can take
She lookin at her body
Its her body that's she plans to replace
Fake, everything all over her face
It's fake, smile, leads up to her lashes
Never been askes about passion
Only been asked about passin the blunt to the left
Or a pick of a chest called him bitch and a mess
She's a wreck
Waitin for a text from a guy
He'd tell her that he love her but he wanna see her cry
He'd tell her that he love her but he beat her every night, with a pipe
That despite she might leave him for a guy with a tie and a job
A mike or a rob
She tired and sobs on the knob of a door
Yelling out ""Please I can't take no more""
And he's yelling out ""Fuck you, you cunt you whore""
Damn, she doesnt wanna be on the news
Only twenty two looking down the barrel of a 22
Looking for a move she can make
Looking at the bruise on her face
Never felt safe
Never felt late 'till the end of the month
Looking down at her stomach
Like what have we done
I was looking for love
And you were looking for fun
And now a life is in my body cause you wanted to cum
Like why, why god
Why do I do this again
And, why am I thinking that we can can find love inside lust
And we love to pretend
I, I know I'm searching for feelings
I thought I could find them by fucking with him
I'm tired of losing my faith

Don't wanna make you lose everything that you love
And we don't understand
Money doesn't buy love
So we pile up all our money just to buy
Some new cars, some new rims, a new binz
He doesn't have friends no more
An Ipod, an Ipad, an Imac
So rich that he's feeling poor
If he had one chance to go back
Wishes that he never bagged a whore
A couple more coors and a broken door
Shatter the coor all over the floor
Coming home at a quarter to four
Coming home is a bore
Looking at a gin bottle
Got a quarter to pour
At a local titty bar
I got a better a pour
No cover ones cover the floor
Really looking for more
And more money makes more problems
He don't understand how to solve them
Doesn't understand his son and his wife or his life
Every night when they fight
Now he's looking at 'em as a problem
That's a problem
Now he doesn't know what to do
Out of touch leaving ten every weekend or two
Thinking money maybe buys all the happiness too
'Till hes sitting in a room staring back at a 22
Like, what happened to life
It was so many years and I thought I was right
It was so many years never living my life
And im scared that my son turnes just like, me
Why me, my god
Everything I see really is a facáde
Fake love, fake hair, fake bills, fake, bi
We replace as a race and we try to play god
Like why, why god
Why do I do this again
And why am I getting so drunk
See my dad was a drunk I don't wanna be him
I, I know I'm searching for feelings
I thought I could find them in bottles of gin
I, I know we're thinkin' that we can find love inside lust and we love to pretend
I, I know I'm part of the problem a silicone kingdom we're living within
I'm tired of losing my faith
And then looking in fake to raplace all my feelings within I
I don't wanna lose myself, lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
Just to ruin, a silicone kingdom with you, with you
I don't wanna lose myself, lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
Just to ruin, a silicone kingdom with you, with you",https://open.spotify.com/track/6R9u8nnM6m3hzdkoov1tJR,320,charlesaznavour
So Many Nights (feat. Devvon Terrell),Dreaming With Our Eyes Open,https://open.spotify.com/album/0x8V30SsjfBNY2PuQ9TO3w,2015,5628864,"So many nights I pray for the day
I knew for my dream, I do whatever it takes
Now here I stand, no one in my way
And now I'm surrounded by all that people say
Yeah, they told me time is of the essence
I ain't sweating, I'm blessed, blessing the tenants
While everybody changing, I never stray from my message
As I sit inside my room, it's a tomb to every invention
And every line that I never gave the time or attention
I'm learning my lesson, you looking for a mention, it's funny
What you would do for the approval of a room full of dummies
You think I made it? But I'm stuck here serving burgers for money
It's funny how I'm selling beef and you don't want beef from me
My written turned into a vision, my vision a reality
My chips are on my dream and you seem to try to devalue me
Value me as less, I got no desk or a salary
You value me by likes on my pictures, not personality
Living my own reality, manifested my vision
Looking at the sky, thanked God for what I was given
Based on how I'm living, I'm wondering if I'll get it
Your passion'll set you free and your fear is more like a prison
We're driven, living life, hope I'm doing it right
Went through hell with a knife, killed every demon in sight
I went through darkness of night to find the brightest of light
You only dreaming at night, I turn my dream into life
We're letting go of who left, you never thought it was right
So many nights I pray for the day
I knew for my dream, I do whatever it takes
Now here I stand, no one in my way
And now I'm surrounded by all that people say
But I will never change at all-all-all-all-all
I will never change at all-all-all-all
I will never change at all-all-all-all-all
I will never change at all-all-all-all
I will never change at all
Yeah, I could've never planned my life like this
I graduated, got a job and still I chose just to write like this
You see the people need advice like this
Building something out of nothing
I ain't bluffing with a sight like this
I know I'm nice when I write, you're like ""I don't get.""
It takes intelligence to listen, something I can't give
I flip the prespective, you see what I just did? Do you get it?
Now take a minute, no it takes you a minute to keep it real
I'm still broke, but got beautiful women
Who see me as an opportunity
Not human, was given an opportunity from no one ever
Who am I kidding?
Fought for my vision, built a team who all believe in my passion
I'm on my way out to LA, I wonder ""How did this happen?""
I turned my dream into a team who all believe in my rap and
You went from laughing to a picture when my lyrics are captioned
And honestly I want this more than ever breathing
The people that need a voice, I'm the voice of people believing
My family all believing it's all in me to achieve it
Don't do it because we want it, we want it because we need it
So many nights I pray for the day
I knew for my dream, I do whatever it takes
Now here I stand, no one in my way
And now I'm surrounded by all that people say
But I will never change at all-all-all-all-all

Somewhere in Between,If You Don't Like the Story Write Your Own,https://open.spotify.com/album/1rKIT2C7BONrvYegtGjeAp,2022,642631,"Look
I miss when AI didn't run the world
And people would consume less than they would create
I miss when gas didn't cost what I used to make
Back when I used to make minimum wage
If low serotonins are linked to depression
Are SSRIs just for numbin' the pain?
Kinda like how my dad used to get drunk off the liquor
To quiet the thoughts in his brain
Look, as you can probably tell
Lately my head and heart have been scattered all over the place
I miss when people saw me as a person
And not as the product of what I create
I wish that we were encouraged to critically think
But instead they just label you crazy
Now I know if I start gettin' too deep on a track
There's no way that the playlist'll play me, damn
If I made Witt, then the question is am I also the creator of Mark?
How many of you state your name and your job
When somebody asks you who you are?
We've all been conditioned to thinkin'
That life is as simple as fillin' in boxes
I used to prioritize people who only ever
Thought of me as an option, now
I'm somewhere in between bein' alone and bein' lonely
It doesn't really matter what they say if they don't know me
As people push and pull, you start to question who you are
Now everyone around you wants to sell you for your parts, yeah
Like an old Jeep, or a Nissan, a Chevy
I guess you'll really find out who your friends really are
When the subject starts gettin' too heavy
I miss when we would take photos to capture the moment
And not just to post them online
I don't know when we're duped into thinkin'
That money was ever worth more than our time
I don't like feelin' like if I'm not postin'
Then I'm just a ghost and I barely exist
We're all addicted to this little box in our pocket
Somethin' no one wants to admit
I think it's crazy I'm labeled as strong
If I say that I go to the gym every week
But if I replace the word ""gym"" here with ""therapy sessions,""
Then everyone labels me weak
Either way, I been workin' on me
I miss the simpler times
I miss when people were genuine friends
Not because of your clout but because you were kind
I miss when I wasn't used to get clicks and views
By people desperate for attention
I know they're chasin' that dopamine hit that they get
When they see that they have a few mentions, damn
I'm somewhere in between bein' alone and bein' lonely
It doesn't really matter what they say if they don't know me
As people push and pull, you start to question who you are
Now everyone around you wants to sell you for your parts, yeah
I'm somewhere in between bein' alone and bein' lonely
It doesn't really matter what they say if they don't know me
As people push and pull, you start to question who you are

Swimming in a love that they gave you
You drown
But they will never love you like I do
In this ocean, you're all I see
You're not a mess, no, you're an empath on a messy earth
Can't understand why somebody
As special as you wants to fit in so bad that it hurts
Your worth isn't based off of how much you earn
You say you feel empty the more you consume
Do we blame the flower when it doesn't bloom
Or blame the terrain it was planted into?
When you walk in a room, everyone stares
You spent thе whole morning on makeup and hair
Still all you see are your flaws
You nеver would see what they see when you look in the mirror
Nobody compares you like nobody else
Being trapped in an app feels like livin' in Hell
See, we live in a world where we're taught
That it's better to be anyone else but ourselves, damn
Your feelings aren't real, your friends are all fake
You're tired as fuck, you just need a break
Don't know if you know
The lower your self-esteem goes, the more that these companies make
The more of yourself that you hate
The more that you look to replace, the more you'll be willing to pay
This hole got me stuck in a game
That you didn't even realize you were playin', so
It's okay to feel the way you do
Swimming in a love that they gave you
You drown
But they will never love you like I do
In this ocean, you're all I see
The truth is, you're as beautiful as beautiful gets
Wish you knew your flaws were just a shift in perception
Away from them being a gift
Does the dopamine hit when you post?
Worth it when you know people pick apart all of your pics?
You're sick of the comments that say, ""Does she even respond?""
When you don't, then they call you a bitch
It's just how it is, it's sad, it's true, man
Think we forgot what it means to be human
These apps are detrimental to our mental health
So we go buy an app to improve it
And call that ""improvement,"" but I digress
I know you're livin' with a lot of stress
Tryin' your best to find the line between work and rest
Haven't found it yet, damn
They see you were thick in the head
But not what goes on in your head, damn, yeah
Ask you how you are in the sheets
But not why you're not leavin' bed, damn, yeah
They sit there and stare at your lips
But don't hear a thing that you said, damn, yeah
They come out the woodwork
And then they get mad when you leave 'em on read
I know that you no longer wanna pretend
Like all the bullshit hasn't taken its toll
You're tired of strivin' to be what they want you to be
When you know you just don't fit the mold
""Sit there and look pretty"" is what you were told
By someone you used to consider a friend
You ask him, ""How am I supposed to feel pretty
With all of these hideous thoughts in my head?""
Never saw him again, at first you were hurt
That they thought your image was all you were worth
But then you realized you were wasting your time
On opinions of people who make you feel worse
You feel like you're cursed, you wanna move on
Remove every contact you have in your phone
You realize the more and more people pretend like they love you
The more you feel like you're alone, just know
It's okay to feel the way you do
Swimming in a love that they gave you
You drown

You can rap over Witt type beats
But you can never be me

We need less sheep, we need more thought
Stuck stayin' ""indie,"" 'cause I can't be bought
One on the charts when you said that I flopped
I look at my plaque and I smile a lot
The bottom is lonely and so is the top
Find you a girl with a plan, not a plot
A fake will jump ship, then they'll say I fell off
Then crawl back when they're feelin' empty and lost
I'm thankful for every fan that I got
They got you a playlist to sweeten the pot
You spend your advance on a chain and a watch
I spend my own money on shit that I got, hehe
I keep it real, feel like the only one
The game's been off balance, all you rappers are Napoleon

I've got some friends in high places
You know, your label, they own it
I treat my room like a cocoon, I should get out more

You were my shelter from the rain when it'd fall
I would call, but never came
I'm not perfect, but I swear I've changed
I still hear your voice, it ricochets off these walls
Give me the words and I'll explain why I faltered from grace
And for all I hold for blame
Just give me one more chance, I'll fight the war I'm scared to face
First things first, I know this letter might be long overdue
Just wanna tell you it's been hard for me to tackle the truth
And watchin' you become a shell of who I knew in my youth
You were the glue that kept the family from splittin' in two
Hate what you have to go through, I bet you feel so alone
You were my shelter back when everything was messy at home
When no one else was there, I knew you'd always answer your phone
Now when they ask you who I am, it hurts, you might not know, damn
Guess I'll remember for us both
Remember when we saw those whales and you threw up on the boat
Remember spendin' days at Fenway, those are days I miss the most
Remember how you cracked a smile when I told you that I wrote
And then you told me you believed in me and my dream-chasing
That's back when I'd record on a USB in the basement
And now I'm here helpless and honestly fuckin' hate it
I know you hate when I swear, but I don't know how else to say it
I remember all the stories you told me 'bout meeting Gram
I know you still remember her laugh, the touch of her hands
They try to say you can't, don't think anyone understands
She's a part of who you are like you're a part of who I am
And damn, when Dad and Gram look down
I wonder if it makes 'em sad where the fam's at now
And when I stand up on stage, where the music is loud
And look out, I swear I see their faces out in the crowd
What hurts the most is that you're here, but haven't seen you in years
But not because of lack of tryin', I want that to be clear
The situation's way more complicated than it appears
And when I think about it all, it always brings me to tears
I fear, as your memory fades
And the dementia makes its way through every inch of your brain
You'll forget about me and all the memories made
I'm not okay, I guess what I'm tryin' to say is
Even if you don't, I still remember it all
You were my shelter from the rain when it'd fall
I would call, but never came
I'm not perfect, but I swear I've changed
I still hear your voice, it ricochets off these walls
Give me the words and I'll explain why I faltered from grace
And for all I hold for blame
Just give me one more chance, I'll fight the war I'm scared to face
Just know it kills me to feel like I let you down
When all I really ever wanted was to make you proud
I miss all of the stories and the wisdom that would spill out of your mouth
Now when we have a conversation, you can barely make a sound
Everything's so different now, I have this hole in my heart
When you moved and Dad passed, the whole fam fell apart
Not havin' either of you here has been so terribly hard
The truth is y'all were the light when my thoughts got dark
I heard you had a birthday and I missed it
I look around the room and not a single relative's here on Christmas
Sometimes I feel the distance has led to us actin' distant
Nothin' is the same, things changed in an instant
And nah, I should prolly call
Always say ""I will,"" but I always drop the ball
Damn, you see the truth is I'm a coward tryna stall the inevitable
Fact, one day I'll call and there'll be nothin' you recall
And I'm appalled that this is how this all played out
A beautiful mind that we just have to watch fade out
See, you're the one who taught me how to make a home out of a house
And that happiness is found when you live in the right now
Not the future or past, just want my grandfather back
Woulda hung on to the moments if I knew they wouldn't last
Just know I'm grateful now for every single second we had
It's sad you'll never see a show or ever get to see me rap
And that's that, fuck, sick of feelin' stuck
Sick of feelin' like everybody has givin' up
Sick of always feelin' like I'll never be enough
'Cause I tried to wear your shoes, but I could never fill 'em up
I'll never know a world where I'm able to let you go
Even though I know to let go of the things that I can't control
It's sad you'll never see me with a family of my own
But know that when that day comes, you'll be a hero in our home, so
Even if you don't, I still remember it all
You were my shelter from the rain when it'd fall
I would call, but never came
I'm not perfect, but I swear I've changed
I still hear your voice, it ricochets off these walls
Give me the words and I'll explain why I faltered from grace

Forever feeling like you could do better
Better than me, I'm wishing oh T
Wishing you stayed but today is the day that you leave
As you packing your bags I'm watching you leave
Reading back over your letter to me
You got tears in your eyes
You can't hide it from me
Both our noses are running
While fighting to breathe
And I'm looking in the mirror like Mark
Got a cold heart how'd it get this far
How'd it get this hard?
Never letting anybody in
Now you're spilling your feelings all over the car
Europe is feeling like mars
Both of us know that I shoot for the stars
Check through your baggage you're packing a piece of my heart
Knew it was over before it could start
Damn, now all that I see are the memories
That me and you could achieve in a short time
Together a reason to season forever
You came in and left like the weather
Both you and I know less than no better

Came all by your life and the likes on your breasts

It's funny they say times is money, when time is the only thing that we don't spend
I did it again, I build up a wall with a tight rope to my heart
And I hope you don't fall, we've been through it all
I sit here and wait for your call
But settling down I don't think that we're ready at all
I'm busy I'm chasing a passion, looking back
Asking how did this happen and how is it now
That I found all the feelings I'm lacking
A tourist of time and our time isn't lasting
I know that we just met
But yes, I love the way you take it off
When I break down on your ass
Wanna have it all
And now you're taking of the memories we made
I hope you sail, I hope you take it all with you
I'm a tourist just like you
And I know that we just met
But yes, I love the way you take it off
When I break down on your ass
Wanna have it all
And now you're taking of the memories we made
I hope you sail, I hope you take it all with you
I'm a tourist just like you
I don't wanna watch you
Fly away
I don't wanna watch you go
Tell me where you stay
I don't wanna watch you, wanna watch you

So sad, I need a friend
Thought ya'll could sedate
Your mistake was putting a needle in
Ya'll broke skin
Now all the demons, they keep on creepin' in
Your mouth is full of shit
I might hit the lip when I piss in it
I took a pic and post it on my Twitter like
What's happenin'?
I hope that I can get a couple likes and find a badder bitch
With nice tits
A nice ass
Some nice lips
A nice rack
She said, ""You're coming too quick""
I said bitch, you define fast
I look up at the clock, how much time pass?
One minute
Oh yeah, you know a minute was straight drillin' that fine ass
She said, ""I think you're lyin', I'm tired and where's the wine at?
And where is all the weed? I'm in need of something to climax""
I said okay, uh, well let me see what I got
I start to search around my house, I found my ex-girl's top
I went from soft to jacking off, now I'm in need of a mop
Then I hear her yellin' from my room, ""Mark, I said I want pot""
Destined to flop
'Cause look at all the bullshit on top
My only chance at success is if Kanye tells me to stop
While I'm at the Grammy's and they hand me the award for best pop
And I think I'm joining One Direction now that Malik is lost
Need a moment to pause
I wanna say hi Miss Swift
If you ever gave me the chance then I could show you my dick
I could send you a pic
I don't care if Harry doesn't like Witt
Like B and J, Witt and Tay, we could take over this shit
Uhh
We could take over this shit
Me and you, we could take over this shit
Hahahaha
But for real, though
Yo
So why'd you send your daughter to college here in the first place?
You pay 20k and your daughter became a sperm bank
Was fuckin' five guys on the first day
She learned how to suck a dick
And still hasn't experienced her first A, damn
She's lookin' up from her knees
She knows about whiskey neat, double D's and the trees
She's gettin' high because the last guy, he left her with ease
Asking him, ""Please don't leave, you said you loved me""
On Tinder swiping right like which bitch gon' fuck me?
You know that I'm the man, five grams of protein and some money
And girls are saying they love me
And guys are wishing they was me
I'm offering nothing more than a washboard on my tummy
It's funny
I might go name my next album The Carter VII
And sell a bunch of copies outside of 7 Eleven
And make it sound like shit so that no one can comprehend it
Baby, must have fucked your ears
And then career
'Cause you ain't sellin'
I'm not dissin' who you think I'm dissin'
It's someone different
I try to be nice and no then one listens
So I'm pissed
And if I hear another bitch try to tell me how she is different
Like, ""I never get around""
But her pussy, I fit my fist in
Insisting that I'm so jealous
I'm jealous of who?
Your screws are loose for you to think I'm jealous of you
You're lame and never made anything but balls turn blue
Tellin' the truth
And when offended, then I'm talkin' 'bout you
And I'm talkin' 'bout you
Stupid ass bitch
Hahaha
Fuck you, you, you and you
Oh
I must be over privileged 'cause I comb my hair
While I'm looking through Wal-Mart
Target and Kohls for some clothes to wear
You stupid fuck, I got a hairy pair
Just for you to suck
And if I bust, I might just bust in your hair
Because I aim high
We are not the same guy
You are just a lame with no brain and a day job
My dad, he got laid off
Too drunk off the Jager
And still drove me all around the town
Wow, thanks, pa!
You could have fucking killed me
I could have been dead
Your only purpose on this Earth was your sperm
And now look what you did
You created the greatest rapper to live
And when I'm standing at the Grammy's
Hi, Granny!
Bitch, you ain't worth shit
Look at me win
I had a friend and he's irrelevant now
Come to find out
Found his tongue in my ex-girl's mouth
Karma's a bitch
And the last I heard is you was surfing the couch
The day you go out is a day that I feel bad for the ground
You're stealing my sound
You're wack and I don't wanna collab
Look at your past
I'm counting every rapper line that you jacked
You sound like me if I could suck on my sack
Like, ""Witt, drop shit so I can copy it and say I can rap""
I've come to attack
You bottom feeder fucks, I'ma blast
Stealing your art and then your lyrics
You're not real, you're an app
Not tweetin' you back
You're honestly the parrot of rap
You're making me laugh
I'm everything the rap game lacks
In fact
Go ahead, compare to the greatest again
They said that Em sounds like Nas
And Hop sounds like Em
And I sound like Hop
So where do we end?
Stop comparing me
Comparing what you can't comprehend
Can't wrap your head around the fact that I'm just nice with a pen
I'm standing up and talking shit, I'm never one to pretend
Never one that would blend
I'm not Eminem and I'm not Lennon

Or you love yellow like a signal off of parachutes
I hate how everyone I meet now, I compare to you
To keep it real, I always thought that I would marry you
I wonder if he noticed that you're not a fan of roses
That's why I always bought you lilies, bet you didn't notice
He loves you at your high, but me, I loved you at your lowest
And even though it's over, grateful that we had our moment
I wonder if he knows you really don't believe in luck
And since your parents split, you really don't believe in love
I wish that you believed in me like I believed in us
Heard through the grapevine he gets jealous when you bring me up
I wonder if he knows he found himself a queen now
See you been takin' him to all the spots that we found
I see your posts and you look happy as can be now
You only know if that's for show or how you're feelin' deep down, damn
Oh, I'm weak to my knees
I find it hard just to breathe
Knowin' you could just leave
You said you'd never let go, you'd never leave me
You'd never leave me, you'd never leave me weak
I wonder if you leave your lashes on his bathroom counter
Remember how we used to stay up, and would talk for hours?
Does he know that you showed him all the songs you said were ours?
And that your favorite time to sing is when you're in the shower?
I wonder if you like the fact that he is nothin' like me
I feel too deep, just like you always said, I'm such a Pisces
Guess you meant nothin' in those letters that you used to write me
Followed my heart because you always said to let it guide me
I wonder if he knows how bad you wanna visit London
Damn, is this really who one day you're gonna call your husband?
I wish you loved me in the ways that now you say you love him
Yeah, I admit, I'm envious, and really wish I wasn't
I wonder if it would've worked if the timin' was different
See, since you left, it always feels like there's somethin' that's missin'
Does he care more about your passion or favorite position?
Or would you rather never ask him to ponder the difference?
Last time we talked, your mom was workin' hard at stayin' sober
Still hope that you and her are workin' on becomin' closer
Sometimes it's hard to just accept that you and I are over
I guess I wrote this more for me because I needed closure
I wonder if you ever wonder if I'm doin' fine
Or if you ever have those moments where I cross your mind
See, time itself, it doesn't heal, you heal yourself with time
I've just become another someone that you left behind, damn
Oh, I'm weak to my knees
I find it hard just to breathe

Whenever they mention the best
Damn, I feel so good to be back
The one and only,
Had to take a step back, so I could learn it in depth
I'm callin' Dan, callin' John and then Matt
To tell 'em all I put their bets on me with every cent that they have

But now I'm older so my only wish is wish you well
Don't know your worst so love is something that you never felt and
Your parents split so you don't even know if love is real, no
It's Friday night, your local dive got you diving back in
All these other men around all they are are practice
Daddy's money it don't make up for the sense you're lacking
And you tell your friends you're happy but we know you're acting
You don't know why, all you want is emotion
Another night, feeling empty and broken
A couple things you still needing to cope with
You're not alone, just know you're not alone
And you've been feeling hopeless now you're looking back like you own this
Like you own it, own it
And you've been feeling lonely so you're telling me put it on me, put it on me
And you've been sitting at the bar with eleven of your girls
Girl, I know you'll break my heart (break my heart)
Yeah, you've been looking like my ex, leave that ass on read
I might hit her with the XOXO
Don't play, you say you need to change but you don't change
You've been looking for love in this cold place
You talk a lot and I hear more in what you don't say
Talking bout you don't play, acting like you okay
You say you need to change but you don't change
You've been looking for love in this cold place
You talk a lot and I hear more in what you don't say
Talking 'bout you don't play, I don't want it
When I was younger I wished for girls like you in wishing wells
But now I'm older so my only wish is wish you well
I hate to say that I relate, I know the pain is real and
You're feeling numb but me I'm colder than December, feel ya
I put you down like I ain't sitting at the same bar too
I talk about how you're a hoe but I play my part too
The DJ put on something for you to play my heart to
And I've been looking around the room and all I see is you
I don't know how, you still keep your composure
With all the weight that you hold on your shoulders
You're telling me you need me to get closer
You're not alone, to know you're not alone
And you've been feeling hopeless now you're looking back like you own this
Like you own it, own it
And you've been feeling lonely so you're telling me put it on me, put it on me

Graduated, got a job and you been working a grind
You're never looking behind
I know you never found me crossing your mind
But I'd be lying if you didn't cross mine
From time to time I see some of your pictures online
Kindest Regards was hard, I left my heart on the line
I wrote a song for you, took a couple months of my time
How can you praise him for flowers and a bottle of wine?
You'll never be mine, remember the time I came to see you?
I thought it would just be you, but there's twelve other people
You see there was never ""We"" so we could never be a sequel
Thought it might've been a date that day, did anything to see you
But I'm nothing more than nothing, you're bluffing, saying you care
Our only real connection is memories that we share
I would never try to blame you, 'cause blaming you isn't fair
Not that you care, the stress is really starting to wear
And in my music, I took our story and I used it
Don't care how you were feeling, I'm busy dropping my new shit
Know people gonna love it, I'm buzzing after I do it
I'm gifted with the curse of honesty and the truth is
I loved you more than words, I didn't know how to prove it
Can't tell you that in person, but always could through my music
Everyone who said they cared isn't there, now I'm confused
I'm broken and bruised, lonely, open, empty and stupid and still I
I thought I had it all figured out
No, you would never fall for me now
I wonder if you wonder why I'm never around
I wonder if you, I wonder if you wonder what I'm doing right now
You can hear the pain in my sound, laughed as I fell to the ground
I wonder if you wonder why I'm never around
I wonder if you, I wonder if you wonder what I'm doing right now
And I can't lie, it hurt a little when you said you didn't want me
To know I never tried is what continues to haunt me
Every pic I see is you and him, his twitter trying to taunt me
You think I let it go? This is old and exhausting
Some offspring, family in a house is what I thought about
Sometimes I wonder if he'll get that now
See we know that you picked a different path
Me, I picked a different route
And I can't help but laugh at how this all played out
You're over me now, I'm hoping you found only the best
Remember when we used to rep that Kanye West?
Graduation and rotation 'cause you liked that best
And back then I didn't want you, now look I'm a mess
I open my chest and through me you can see no spine
My profile pic and lyrics I've been hiding behind
It looks like you found the love that I was hoping to find
The only you I love is the one that I create in my mind and still I
I thought I had it all figured out
No, you would never fall for me now
I wonder if you wonder why I'm never around
I wonder if you, I wonder if you wonder what I'm doing right now
You can hear the pain in my sound, laughed as I fell to the ground
I wonder if you wonder why I'm never around
I wonder if you, I wonder if you wonder what I'm doing right now
I thought I had it all figured out
No, you would never fall for me now
I wonder if you wonder why I'm never around
I wonder if you, I wonder if you wonder what I'm doing right now
You can hear the pain in my sound, laughed as I fell to the ground
I wonder if you wonder why I'm never around
I wonder if you, I wonder if you wonder what I'm doing right now
I often wonder if you ever did care
I wonder why in my mind is the only time you ever were there
See we were friends, but that felt more like pretend
This year is awfully clear, the real us is what I fear
The one where we were only friends and I acted like we dated
And nowadays our conversation is, ""Hey happy belated""
And every song I wrote for you, you know you actually hate it
Because you realize that you never felt the same when you played it
You never cared if I made it, that's why I waited, you know me
See, all the love that I've been getting through my phone feels phony
I rhyme a couple words together, every girl wanna blow me
We're in a world full of people, yet I'm feeling so lonely
If only I could tell myself there's plenty fish in the sea
But see the sea is full of sharks, fake guppies and greed
And as I find myself drowning while I'm fighting to breathe
I realise that I'm in love with what I thought we could

Of people who made it 'cause you were to average

I put in work and just thought it was obvious
Give me a mic and a beat and I'll body it

Lost faith in falling in love
You came and made me believe
I've got hurt in my heart, deep

I can't stop obsessing on my successes
No matter what I do I just never could see my blessings
So every conversation you try to gage where my head is
Cause it never seems to be on the top
And we're dissecting
We're spending our time on everything other than me and you

You feel the pressure times two
We fight, you start to cry

I walk away when really all I want to say is that I love you

You say you love the real me, even when I don't believe it
I said some shit I didn't mean
You say, why don't you repeat it, motherfucker
Now why don't you think about what you said
Instead of saying I love you, I'm going out with my friends
Instead of saying I love you, I say I'm going to bed
I hate the fact that they're sad so the battles
Inside your head killing my egos become bigger than my heart
I wanna end this fucking fight, it's just I don't know where to start

I want you to know I care about you and it's easy and it's hard
I know it's hard but
If everything were to crash
I wouldn't give a single second that I spent with you back
So you make me a better me, you're everything that I lack

The moon and the planets are there
And new hopes for knowledge and peace are there

On the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure
Of which man has ever embarked
Our self-lord and master shall bring disaster to evil factors
Demonic chapters shall be captured by kings
Through the storms of days after
And to the earth from the sun through triple darkness to blast ya
With a force that can't be compared to any firepower

Like constellations reflect at night

Whose soldiers died, I know the five families, we shed tears and mourn

Despite the stocking caps he noticed the same cat, who used to give him dough
And taught him, to use the same gat
Supposed to be an Uncle, fam and all that
He could tell that it was him cause he had on the same slacks, he wore when
He took him to Meadowlands racetrack
Why did he flip and go out like that?
It's called betrayal
Scandalous, money greed and lust
In this trife life, there ain't nobody you can trust

It's called betrayal
He on a mission to become a ball player
Flip big Benz's, flossin all gators
Had it all mapped out, 6-8, 12th grader
Fresh outta school, he fin' to go lay paper
He had abrother who was hustlin collectin his change
Never let his baby brother stick his neck in the game
Told him all he had to do is just enjoy the ride
And he ain't have to worry about money cause that's in time
So now he's pacin as the time moves slowly
Can't wait to face Shaquille in the paint and school Kobe
Kept his grades and stayed up under neighborhood functions
And then a group of knuckleheads came through dumping
So now he's sittin on the sidewalk bleeding
Fell into a puddle of his own blood and stopped breathin
And everybody in the neighborhood still grievin
But destiny caught up with his ass and he got even
And all the cryin in the world ain't goin to bring him back
His brother, sittin at the wake wipin tears from his mother's eyes
Why'd the game have to go and take the young boys life
Only the wicked live shife, payin the price
While he's starin at the shell
His brothers soul wants hell the trigger man made bail
And you, wouldn't pay the boys mail, and sacrificed the fuckin family
That's betrayal
Betrayal(echoes)
Scandalous, money greed and lust
In this trife life, there ain't nobody you can trust

Ours is a better gift, not to be bragging nor lolligagging
I can see dimensions of sound and light around my mic
Transmitting lyrics like teletype
Reacting to a beat in a whisper
And like a transistor, I'm sounding dope when I'm crisper
The shortest length between two points is a straight line
I've gotta take mine, I heard it through the grapevine
That some can't find hype lines (hype lines...)
And so I'm smothering, over my prey I am hovering
Suckers I'm shoving at the same time covering
You with the blanket of some language that's distinguished
How swift can I get? you ask and I'll tell
For I can excel real well like a gazelle
Past your head, I'm grabbin abstract thought
Like some gain glory, while others get no part
I feel for the hurt ones, the victims of wrong deeds
Awareness is key, our people have strong needs
Science, math, history theology
Philosophy psychology english and biology
Et cetera, and all of these have a purpose
But genocide makes me nervous
So many questions, many opinions to mention
And damn (damn...) this jam's beyond comprehension
Like planets in orbit, we ride the life cycle
Some take a rifle on the street cause it seems neat
Whatever turns you on I guess, that's why vests are in season
I'll do my show then I'm leavin
I'd rather be blastin dope sounds on the other side of town
Than be there when they close the place down
But anyway, everyday, there's another way
For a person to just flip, so a brother may
Simply go buckwild, get crazy and mad
I know the struggle my father had
Poetry it comes from within, and will always win
Hold captive bodies from end to end
And at a party, I'll survey then slay with the quickness
Displaying the fitness
Easing the mind and relieving the tension
And singing my own song... that's beyond comprehension",https://open.spotify.com/track/6XtbUGgpXbbvF2lm5N6qX7,193,gangstarr

They will never know - all the reasons why I flip
And now I gotta keep an extra clip
They will never know - what this stress is like
And why I'm on point, ready to fight
They will never know - all the pressure and pain
Don't give a fuck if they think less of me mayne
(Verse Two: Guru)
Deadly habits, they could be a number of things
Everybody got 'em, some people do ugly things
Excessive behaviour, it can get the best of you
Trust me, I'm a lot like the rest of you
I got issues, that haven't been resolved
You know like, money people owe me while they out havin a ball
(Mmm) Guess they too got deadly habits
Got me on a mission, to go and merk, each and every faggot
Manager's coked up, A&R's all doped up
Old school style, have 'em gagged up and roped up
Those deadly habits have me losin my cool
But yo the Son can't chill, so I'ma be abusin them fools
Pull the plug on 'em, pull the rug on 'em
Have 'em callin up, all their closest thug friends
Them niggaz can get it too
This GangStarr shit is too deep, to even get into
So fuck you!
(Chorus)
(Verse Three: Guru)
Fuck you wanna do, we way past 7: 30
Be easy, too many brothers seem to go to heaven early
It's hell in these streets, but soon I'm on a hot streak
Who's in the hot seat, who had a felony beef
Yo I beat cases, with different attorneys
And I laughed at the racist DA's, who were wishin to burn me
My mom caught a heart attack, around the same time
News articles were published, around the same time
This depressed me more, but I stayed in tact
And that last corny chick I was with, she got played in fact
I know niggaz that did dumb time, and dumb crimes
I fuck with real niggaz, and never cowards with dumb minds
This country's got us in a fix
America, your deadly habits, got us all up in the mix
War without, war within, holy war, mortal sin
Tell me - huh, what's the origin?

Dominions, I'm in them when it's time to kick shit from

Feelin' satisfaction from the street crowd reaction
Chumps pull guns when they feel afraid, too late
When they dip in the kick, they get sprayed

I get more props and stunts than Bruce Willis

The emotions that one goes thourgh, over a loss of a loved one
Or friend then, knowing the cost of rebuilding and carrying on
It gets so damn hard in this modern day Babylon
And disease runs rampant, so many men carry arm
So many have a lonely painful road to travel on
Mothers losing sons, improper use of guns
Children go astray because their parents were abusive ones
I used to run with the illest guys
Thourgh the realest eyes
I seen the realest and the illest die
The cycle continues, so many times the good ones
The young ones
So many misunderstood ones
Remembering their faces and voices
And when the wise man said
Life is full of choices
Some get caught up, others are innocent victims
All I know is they were close to us, and that we miss them

i let him chill at my crib cause we were down and
i went to work everyday while he was loungin
he tried to backstab he kept on jokin
he didn't know he could've got his back broken
i had to cut homeboy off for even tryin that

stepped to him quietly, he copped a plea
told him to fix it or i'd have to catch a body
in this society, there's many snakes
don't be too eager when you're seeking a break
cause chumps will exploit, use you to benefit
so just be keen and, learn all the ins of it
i've had my share, of dealing with fake men
i left them squealing, ""it was i who did the taking""
proceeding exactly, according to plan
i foiled the scheme cause it seemed i was that man
and if you step up like the kid who did front
you will bear witness... the execution of a chump

i'll reach you deftly, directly, correctly so select me
elect me as your prophet and we'll praise him as i drop it

Love maker, back breaker, but then I made a mistake
Yes I fell in love with this ill chick
Sweatin' me for money, my name and the dilsnick
My homeboys told me drop her, 'cause it would be to my benefit
She used to say I'd better quit hanging with those derelects
Romancing is my thing but I can't swing with no scheming hoes
Wherever my Beemer goes you know that I'm driving
Surviving in the 90's is a must so I trust
That everyone listen up as my vocals give thrust
I bust my rhymes first never chasing a skirt
Do much work while other suckas need more time to rehearse
Now back to the ex-girls, ex-lovers, ex-friends
It made me mad to find that she was only after my ends
She phones me and goes on about her new life now
I wish she knew right now, I think she's busted let's discuss it
When I was with her no trust, just fights
Just the he-say-she-say and the neighborhood highlights
Now I got my new girl or as I say my baby doll
But still I'm gettin' crazy calls, my ex-girl's got balls
Don't wanna play the field 'cause I get lovin' at home base
Don't gimme no long face just exit with grace
You and I are the past, c'est la vie, much respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl, 'cause I'm on with the next girl
'Cause girls look so good, next
'Cause girls look so good, next
'Cause girls looks so, so, so good, next
'Cause girls look so good, next
'Cause girls look so good, next
'Cause girls look so, so good, next, next
She had much loot liked to buy me fresh-dipped gear
Liked to have me near 'cause of my savoir faire
The time we shared was brief 'cause I needed relief
From her high-classed antics and all her conceit
Now she's crying wolf and I like don't wanna hear that
I told her the bear facts when things started out
She wines and she pouts about how I did her bad yo
But she'd tried to buy me, even tempt me with the hiney
I fell for a sec 'cause the clothes were real fly
I could almost feel I would give into her whims
Her thoughts were erratic, sporadic, crazy in nature
I told her, hey look, yo I can no longer date ya
Tried to pimp me with bank and fell short, your ship sank
Many thanks for the time and the watch and the link
You and I are the past, c'est la vie, 'nuff respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl 'cuz I'm straight with the next girl
'Cause girls look so good, next
'Cause girls look so good, next
'Cause girls looks so, so, so good, next
Looks, looks, looks
Looks, looks, looks
Looks, looks, looks
So good
You saw my mom's in the supermarket and gave her your number
You asked how's my sister, then asked how's my brother
Didn't ask about my father 'cause you know he ain't like ya
Every time I left for your crib yo he'd really get hyper
The advice he used to give me makes much sense now
I can't believe I used to let you break my confidence down
You used to ask me why the hell did I wanna live in Brooklyn?
You messed up my flow although you were good-lookin'
Yes darlin', was fly and this was the problem
'Cause back in the day she had me scheming and robbin'
To get her things to wear so when she went to the club
All eyes were on her and oh me I just bugged
Caught in between felling proud or feeling more like a sucker
Had to go undercover, get away, find another
Been in Brooklyn nine years and been around the world too
I've seen so many fly girls and I knew just what to do
I went from ex to the next, took my time with each one
And you know they still love me so stop jellin' me hon
I went home to see my mom and I saw you at the bus stop
Must I stop? Nah I think not
You and I are the past c'est la vie, much respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl and I'm out with the next girl
'Cause girls looks so good, next
'Cause girls looks so good, next

So run and get some help with the problems that you face
Take a taste of the bass put your perspective in place
Get real, deep, so you can keep involved
Revolve and solve, so you can make the calls

No time for another sucker, let him ring the buzzer

You know it's backwards to go against God, dawg
I destroy the mic for my glow
You know, you-
You know it's backwards to go against God, dawg
That explains how we rock
Mister Gang Starr, I make it do what it do
So true, classic like the Fu Manchu
Now, you cowards see I'm holdin' the title
Married to the game, son, you know that I'm vital
Your shit's weak, you ain't true to this
I'm the embodiment of real, I paid my dues in this
Mister Gang Starr, a hip-hop phenom
The bomb, these misfits just don't belong
Off-top, I go for the head pop
You got your chest protected so you still get dropped
Bedrock, just like Barney and Fred
Mister Gang Starr, comin' with a army of heads
Your charm is now dеad, they tired of you
Not any of 'em gonna ask what you wеre tryna do
I'm fryin' a few domes, just like I do catfish
Got 'em doin' backflips, this ain't gymnastics
This drastic for foes, I got 'em walkin' on tippy toes
Ballerina style, you don't wanna see the ninas, child
Meanwhile, Mister Gang Starr relates
Not commercial, yet still I'm one of the greats
Controversial like your favorite emcee debates
I'm classic like a break comin' straight out the crate
Fresh out the gate again, time to fill my plate again
It's Mister Gang to the Starr, I'm the latest trend
Mister Gang Starr, I make it do what it do

The bomb, these misfits just don't belong
Who's a legendary character? Harder than the floor
Similar to nothin' you ever saw
Historically consistent, methodically persistent
Categorically gifted for sure
Never down for the count, might fool you with the rope-a-dope
Work by combinations, crack your shell, spill your yolk
Witness my third evolution
Close your eyes if you're afraid to see these herbs execution
Wanna-bes, I annihilate, obliterate, terminate
Treat 'em like batter, watch these short cakes bake
Mister Gang Starr, the one and only, only one
Niggas are gassed, soon, they'll be the lonely ones
You know me son, I bring the fire like a blowtorch
So don't step too close or you'll end up gettin' most scorched
Just like a charcoal briquette
So pay homage, we ain't even make it hard for you yet
Mister Gang Starr, I make it do what it do
So true, classic like the Fu Manchu
Now, you cowards see I'm holdin' the title
Married to the game, son, you know that I'm vital

So I easily drop you and stop you from rhymin'
Send you home to moms all bruised up and cryin'
Then if you want, you can go call your people
You're gonna need a mob against me 'cause I'm lethal
Not that I'm a violent brother, no, to the contrary
My vocals carry then I bury
MC's in holes they dug for themselves
Couldn't be themselves so they sold theirselves
To a company exec who doesn't have respect
For real rap music so he wants to get
An MC that starts out street to cross over
But not me, 'cause I'm the hardcore composer
I'm harder than the hardest, hardest hard can get
I'm harder than the hardest, hardest hard can get
You ain't a writer, nor a fighter, you're just a biter
I think you need to save all that because in spite of
The reputation that you think you have
The crew already knows that you're really a crab
So I'll grab the mic with haste and send you out of this place
Back to trace my flow, but don't waste your time, bro
It only takes a minute and a second for me to switch
And rearrange real quick

Retire a liar, and very easily I'm passin' by ya
'Cause you didn't wanna give the credit
Where it was due, yeah, it was you
Uh-huh, it was you and your crummy corny ass crew
So we shall enforce that you lost
And plus you oughta find another type of life
And yes, another source of income, here's some advice
You can't rap this nice, I broke ya over and over
I told ya I would mold ya, why? (Put it on 'em!)
Because I'm bound to give original sound as your ears pound
Bringin' pleasure and pain and brains start to gain
From musical measures, formin' stanzas, combining
Providing answers to mystical questions
Never typical inventions
Developed by my gifted, unlimited mind
Suckers wanna talk, but they mimic the rhyme
'Cause they're eager to find the secret behind
The way that I stomp all comp just like a Timberland
It's the Guru and Premier, it's them again
Droppin' fly tracks and takin' things over

Up to this level, or should I say caliber?
It's just some hype that the company's sellin' ya

But in the next year, someone new will just squish him

Wearin' rings and medallions

So I'll send 'em packin', they should've known I'd be taxin'

His power is so great
That's for real
Ain't about a whole lotta talk
It's, it's, it's about, about, it's, it's about a-a-action, can you dig it?
He got the eye and the heart to do it, yeah
From the roof with a scope, there's a whole art to it
Ain't no emotion when he pulls the trigger
Brief second of silence, then you see what he do to niggas
Pistols, rifles, grenades, whatever
He's a killin' machine, bought and paid for and clever
And way iller than the last nigga
Smoke a nigga in the club then dance right past niggas
Once in a while, there'll be one who'll stand out
Who's more than psycho, who'll take any man out
With a certain passion for sendin' bullets blastin'
A certain fashion to the way this nigga wax 'em
And this assassin gets mad satisfaction
From puttin' all this worthless scum out of action
A sense of pride in his skill
Looks in the mirror and salutes before he rides for the kill
You got the bag, pop? I got the thing-thing
It's in the sling, here it is, let me let it ring
With the doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Or do it lawn mower style, rrt
You got the bag, pop? I got the thing-thing
It's in the sling, here it is, let me let it ring
I got potatoes and the mufflers in the whole thing
With the fwt, doo-pa, doo-pa, doo-pa, doo-pa, doo-pa, doo-pa
Buckin' at niggas wigs while he's puffin' on cigs
Lay him down, then he bounce out of town to another gig
It ain't nothin', he don't need many friends
Funded different type of weapons, he got plenty of them
If you pass him on the street or see him in his spot
He's always calm, cool, collected, very rarely is he not
Hit man, with ice in his veins
Does the job so precise they up the price with his name
Shadowy figure, never too loose with the lip
Forty-four long in his coat, deuce-deuce on his hip
Baby nine in his boots and his trunk is full
This nigga's on some shit and can't be fucked with, fool
In the grimy world of highly-paid hustlers
First they get goons to muscle ya, then get him to touch ya
You wouldn't wanna get in his way, nor his associates
Or a tombstone bearin' your name will be appropriate

Slander the name, and withhold facts
But I'm the type of brother with much more game
I got a sure aim, and if I find you're to blame
You can bet you'll be exterminated, taken out, done
It doesn't matter how many, they go as easy as just one
Bust one round in the air for this here
'Cause this year, suckers are goin' nowhere
'Cause my street style and intelligence level

MC's that ain't equipped get flipped in my circle

So much anger built inside
So don't stop to say hi, motherfucker, just die
My shit holds a mouthful so I guess you know what's up
While punks get killed at the end of the month
Styles and styles I flip, Lil Dap remain sick
Yes, the Group Home is thick, so all you punks hear this
Every time you riff, the more fame that we get
Motherfuckers act hard, thinkin' that they are God
Niggas just don't understand, let me be my own man
Did everything on my own 'cause every place wasn't home
Anywhere that I rest, had to dress with a vest
I guess you get the routine, but with a lot of stress
Frustration on my mind, brothers doin' their time
Rhymes are organized like crime as you're ripped in a line
Brothers just don't know how shit got to go
'Cause I was told to never give my back to the street
As I walk through the ghetto, dead souls I greet
See my man, give him pound, then I walk with a frown
Another minute, another brother's gunned down
Shit is gettin' too close, that's why the Group Home is thick
So every time you riff, the more fame that we get
My father always said don't watch the one 'cross the street
Watch the one right next because he's easy to flex

Bust up chumps so crab kids, keep quiet

It's been that way for a while, so much has come and then went
But I'm confident, a few, are due to redeem
Their respective kingdoms, with an abundance of cream
So if I were to scheme, it would be on a realer dream
Like formin' effective teams to filter the smokescreens
You totin' in jeans, don't even know the true envy
The man I'm pickin' apart, and plus they both were friends to me
Past trivial pursuits like East and West coast feuds
Come against me on the mic, many and most will lose
Like most dudes, I love this hip-hop, and this rap stuff
But I don't like the shows, where the ignorant act up
While some'll be rippin' it, they be in the crowd wildin'
Flippin' on kids, for the chains and medallions
Or the kid, they don't like, from a beef from way back
And decide that's the night, perfect time for payback
It's wack for the group, plus the others who came
To see a fat ass show, instead there's bullets aflame
While they devise our demise, we grow wise
Upset the set up, the element of surprise
Itz a set up
It's time to upset the set up
Still waters run deep, this is leagues in depth
Quiet as kept they slept we crept
Society puts the squeeze on MC's like iron grips of death
From here on in peace and blessings long cherish your breath
Gifted and Rhyme, you now how we do, stay true
Follow through lay down the law, 'cause it's probable and overdue
All systems overdue, my guns know me
I only hold a few my nigga for only a few hold me
Never forget the ones before me, my momma told me
Sacrifice for the ones behind me leadin' the seeds
Blind leads, black on black, crime to me
Inclined to refine my creed, I eat thinkin' lead
Conceive to make the beast bleed, enhance thoughts
Like tossed trees 'cross the Earth three-fourths
Let my offspring feed all three, corpus delectis cost me
Lost and found on enemy ground, quoted although
They don't know how we get down at sound speed we breed
No more confined to blind greed and self destructive deeds
Heed my freedom war cry, of course I'm N.Y.
Hug my peeps that died, the loved ones alive
Reinforce and fly high as I lie so shall I
From New I to Cali, next plateau U.N.I.versal
Unleash the black rain
Show 'em who in control, electro-magnetic
Pull on the hole, ill as toters bang out
'Til we sittin' on swole, the strongest way to grow

Please approach the bench

Yo they got me handcuffed, I'm down in central booking
Things are fucked up, the way my future's looking
But I'm too fly, i'ma change this scenario
Make some power moves and tighten up my bankroll
Chumps are leary though, they see me as a threat
I'm like the black dutch schultz when you get me upset
Five-oh makes me wanna flip, larry davis style
Got a nigga depressed, while he's awaiting trial
It's ok though, cause from grey skies comes blue
Through darkness comes light and I be known as the guru
And this I certify we all should be alerted by
The traps within the system, our youth is getting murdered by
The DA says they got me on a felony
I'm tryin to live my life, so what the fuck is you tellin me?
The streets are war, that's what brothers carry weapons for
And I take the weight as I did before
The next thing you know, they got me on the radio
A rapper arrested, suckers showin me on video
Of course I know, that I'm a role model
But yo this rap life is real life sometimes it's full throttle
Right now I gotta think about me fuck the industry
You gets no love, except those who support me
What's the story, what happened when I went to LA?
Mixing shit up, no not there I got family
Nothing happened, mind your business yo step
You know we connect, JFK to LAX
They wanna lock us all up, and throw away the key
Don't wanna see us come up, don't wanna see us makin g's
Long as we know this is the key to our destruction
Let's make moves no discussion
Peace to my man hass, and orange man paying the cost
All the twenty-five to lifers all my brothers getting tossed
Into the system, supposed to rehabilitate
It's why you gotta regulate your own mindstate
Read, study lessons and build your inner power
The next level, doesn't tolerate cowards
For example, I know this rich nigerian
Powerful american that's proud to be an african
He asked me why do all us brothers be gettin trapped
I told him I'd explain it broke it down in a rap
Whether you got naps, braids waves or no hair
Without esteem for yourself nigga, you going nowhere
And you can swagger like you rule this josey wales
Unorganized revolt almost always mostly fails
Give up the savage ways, be effective soldiers
To elevate the mental is to be poor no more
There's war in the streets, prepared men know best
Our rhyme as live as it gets, JFK to LAX
They're always makin trouble yo, against the righteous
Killing us in cold blood, those beats those vipers
And as I sit feelin the pain in my wrist
I vow to myself that i'ma change this shit
Or at least I gotta try, or part of me will die
And only by action will any ideas solidify
So I inhale, exhale as I ponder
This grown man will make mistakes no longer
I've been there, I've seen how they make us fall victim
To their tricknowledgy, with no apology I diss em
And so I rip facts to dope tracks I caress

Brothers are amused by others brother's reps
But the thing they know best is where the gun is kept
'Cause in the night, you'll feel fright
And at the sight of a four-fifth, I guess you just might
Wanna do a dance or two
'Cause they could maybe bust you for self or with a crew
No matter if you or your brother's a star
He could pop you and jet without a getaway car
And some might say that he's a dummy
But he's sticking you and taking all of your money
It's a daily operation
He might be loose in the park or lurking at the train station
Mad brothers know his name
So he thinks he got a little fame from the stick-up game
And while we're blaming society
He's at a party with his man
They got their eye on the gold chain that the next man's wearing
It looks big but they ain't staring
Just thinking of a way and when to get the brother
They'll be long gone before the kid recovers
And back around the way, he'll have the chain on his neck
Claiming respect, just to get a rep
Stick up kids is out to tax
Stick up kids is out to tax
Stick up kids is out to tax
And this is how the story goes
Ten brothers in a circle had the kid trapped
The one with the hoodie said, ""We'll hurt you""
If you don't run all your jewels and pay
Give up the Rolex watch or you won't see another day
See they were on the attack
And one said, ""Yo, you wanna make this to a homicide rap?
Make it fast so we can be on our way
Kick in the rings and everything, okay?""
The kid was nervous and flinching
And little shorty with the .38, yo, he was inching
Closer and closer, put the gun to his head
Shorty was down to catch a body instead
Money was scared so he panicked
Took off his link and his rings, and ran frantic
But shorty said, ""Nah"" pulled the trigger and stepped
It was nothing, he did it just to get a rep
Stick up kids is out to tax
Stick up kids is out to tax
Stick up kids is out to tax
And this is how the story goes
The rep grows bigger, now he's known for his trigger finger
Rolling with troops of his sons like a gangster figure
He's near the peak of his crazy career
His posse's a nightmare, macking jewels and crazy gear
But as we know, the things we do come back
And Shorty's not peeping, others are scheming to counteract
'Cause the kid that got shot didn't perish, so
He pulls up in a jeep with tinted windows
Too late, Shorty was caught in the midst
His time ran out, his number came up, and that's it

I bring surprises to the chief plus their advisers

Ever since young Krumb, was taught to rap well
Going deep, process of thought, when my eyes closes
Awaken with turban, robe and sandals like Moses
Travelling high sands and eastern lands for the answers
Ignorance is spreading through the streets like it was cancer

Only a few percent knew what me and you went through
We've been sent to dominate, these corny come-lates
And set this crooked rap shit straight from Crenshaw to Castle Gate
Like Pete and CL, I reminisce over days
From the streets of Boston to New York and all the ways
For certain niggas to blow up, and crime paid
But my praise goes to the most high
'Cause some nights I got so wild yo, I almost died
Some stuff I got into, really scarred my mental
Pops wasn't trying to hear it, 'cause of what he been through
Still, like my nigga Havoc said, sometimes you gotta
Hit your crew off, so they can make some bread
'Cause no matter the weather, niggas be needing cheddar
And things in this world are more fucked up than ever
So let's make this bond to keep this hip-hop strong
You a man baby pop, you know right from wrong
So stay out of trouble, and that goes for me too
That's what we need to do, that's my advice to you
You remember what happened last time, when you got knocked
Doing your thing, sewing shit up on the block
You need to stop, fore you get caught again
Or you get shot and I lose another friend
(Any man with the plan is precise with his life)
(Think twice)
My advice to you, cut down on champagne and booze
For a nigga like me, most time that shit's bad news
It's like lighting a fuse, whether it's sneakers or shoes
'Cause somebody always wanna step up to start a feud
It's like set-tin it off but not the movie
Plus let's get some real women, forget floozies and the groupies
'Cause they spell mad problems from watts to Harlem
And the bullshit won't stop, long as the world's revolving
And I recall when niggas knew my pops had clout
But they didn't know my sorry ass was getting kicked out
And they was seeing if I wanted to come bubble with them
And make my ends triple and double with them
And get in trouble with them, now memories of them
I wear 'em in my heart like a emblem
I doubt we'd ever be big-time selling dope coke or dust
It's killing us, let's take our people and make a exodus
Annihilation, inhalation through the lungs
Or extermination, by the use of dirty guns
Triple beam dreams and drug schemes of mad cream
Could be a sad scene when you go to that extreme
(A-Any man with the plan is precise with his life)

Hope you have better luck next time
You thought you brought your best lines

It's where I find my heaven and where you find your hell at
You're in my clutches now, you get slit up and lit up
Just like some Dutches now
See, I'm hard to define, my mind travels far
From ghettos to galaxies, representin' Gang Starr
The street life, the reason why my mic ignites
I bring more ruckus than a nightclub fight or bar brawl
I'm swingin' lyrics like broken glass, pa, to scar y'all
Hold your head, 'cause all that weak shit is dead
See the times are changin' and me and my peeps is gettin' crazy fed
So remember when you writin' your rhymes
Stop fantasizin' and bring some real shit next time
Yeah, bring some real shit, yo

I ain't them other kids, I don't need to play no catch-up
I got too much pride for this
I know some niggas that'll ride for
This, with me it's do or die for this
Street knowledge, intellect, and spirituality
My survival package as I deal with reality
I'm like Fishburne in Hoodlum when I come to do 'em
Chew 'em up, spit 'em out, the most respected, no doubt
You seen me in action, so act like you been knowin'
The G-U-R-U of the Gang, I been flowin'
Just like the River Niger all the way to the Hudson
Had so many lyrics stashed, and I couldn't wait to bust some
Lately, I've watched this game evolve and elevate
So now I push my music like drug dealers push weight
Straight like that, straight out the gate
'Cause it's never too late to set this fuckin' record straight
But it is too late for you and your crew, son
You had the audacity to come against me, the gifted one
And Premo with the tracks to inspire my next line
You got no wins here, so better luck next time

And this your co-host with the co-most
The mystic majestic left-right-left kid
Jeru the Damaja
Ayo, son
Yo, what's up, son?
I heard some crabs all in it
Talkin' about how you drink 40's and this and this and that
What?
Tell me what you feel about that
Yeah, whatever, whatever
Ayo, Premier, speed up this track and I'ma drop the latest facts
As I deliver rhymes with ease and walk around with my head up
I'm dead up serious so don't be gettin' too curious
Motherfuckers always wanna know what makes me tick
I pull a phrase out quick 'cause I'm dipped and I'm slick
You thought that I would slip 'cause you seen me drinkin' 40's
It shocked you, then you told your friends you saw me
Well, say what you want 'cause all of mine is intact
In fact, I'll have you open like a hooker's gap
I like to catch a buzz 'cause I get into the beats more
MC's are washed up like dead fish on a seashore
Save the talk, 'cause you know I walk that walk
Hittin' city to city but make my home in New York
I know the time with this rap shit 'cause they got it all backwards
They need to take a hint or catch my microphone imprint
Straight to the dome through the skull to the tissue
Call me Guru, I'll diss you if you're pressin' the issue
Not my style to be sweatin' all the stupid-ass rumors
I'll take it as a compliment and fuck you too
If you're schemin' on a chance to put a stain on my name
Don't even think about it 'cause ain't no shame in my game
The shame in my game
The, the, the, the shame in my game
The, the, the, the shame in
The shame in, the shame in, the shame in my game
The, the, the, the, the shame in my game
The, the, the, the shame in my game
The, the, the, the shame in my
The shame in my, the, the, the shame in my, my, my, my game
Stick to the subject, I ain't afraid to be real
A lot of MC's fake hard just to gain appeal
I like some gangster rap, don't like the prankster crap
So I get past all that by kickin' straight up facts
There ain't no reason to shoot unless you got beef
If you pull out and you don't use it then you may catch grief
Toolies and TECs ain't toys but kids got 'em today
If they're ready to spray, best get the fuck out the way
I try keepin' my sanity by thinkin' of better times
If I write clever rhymes then maybe I'll climb
But what the hell's success if the mess ain't changin'?
5-0'S still corrupt, stupid gangs still bangin'
Stick-up kids still stickin', nasty hookers still trickin'
All the pimps still pimpin' and all the crackheads trippin'
While the dealers still sellin' so I'll refrain from the yellin'
And the preachin', 'cause who the fuck would I reach?
Man, niggas don't wanna starve that, they wanna live fat
Who'd wanna clean up their act when the papes come in stacks?
They live for the minute and they're all wrapped up in it
It's an unfortunate state, for many it's too late
Now death stalks the streets and it's right at your gate
So buck, lose your mind, but I ain't goin' insane
I kick the fly lyrics 'cause ain't no shame in my game
The, the, the, the, the, the, the, the shame in my game
The, the, the, the shame in my game
The, the, the shame in my, the shame in my
The shame in my, my, my, my game
Life's a bitch, so who are we to judge each other?
I know I got faults, I ain't the only motherfucker
Stuff I heard about you wasn't too cool, you know
Like how you smoke woolies and that your girl's a ho
But I don't listen to shit unless the story's legit
And knuckleheads need to quit 'cause they be ridin' the dilsnick
But I'm takin' care of business regardless
And when it comes to rhymin', you know I'm hittin' hardest
So you can kick dirt but in the end you'll feel pain
You little sucker, there ain't no shame in my game
The shame in my game
The, the, the, the shame in my game

When I met this nigga, him and Guru, right? (Mmm-hmm)
It probably—what was that, '87, '88? ('88)
'88, I was 16, 17 years old
I was gettin' money in Baltimore, I'm from the Bronx (Okay)
So, I respected niggas from outta town coming to another town tryin' to get money (A'ight)
Feel me? So that's what clicked me with Gang Starr
I thought Guru, God bless him, was my little man
That nigga was ten years older than me
I'm from outside (Okay)
And I thought that, you know
I come from the era where rappers wasn't really, uh, admired the way they are now
You feel me? (Right) Them niggas was entertainers to us (Mmm-hmm)
We was fuckin' with niggas who threw stones at the penitentiary (Right)
Alright, so, when I got with Gang Starr, it was like

I do the one before a gun come out

A ghetto doctrine to watch every pistol pop
And then while you watchin examine all options
Young bodies in the coffin more often
It stay the same from Brooklyn to Boston
Every interstate, more youth with the inner hate
Deep in the struggle, puttin food on they dinner plate

The names have been changed to protect the innocent
Each step is intricate, I rep magnificent
Knew this kid named Ronnie, used to make cash with Caesar
They made a lot of money back in the 80's crack fever
Caesar was an overachiever, a kingpin and 18-and-a-half
He got knocked and left Ronnie to watch the team and the stash
Plus his crib, his jewels, his whip and his girl
And Ronnie's self-interests had him livin in a different world
He rocked Caesar's chains, he put Caesar's rings
Smokin mad wools all day, with Caesar's change
Not to mention he pushed up on Caesar's wifey
A move like that my man, extremely sheisty
It all got back to Caesar in the bing
They found Ronnie's body in the playground by the swings
Anyone can get it, for sure it don't matter dawg

Rise for me now, kneel for me now
Time to pass judgment, can't feel for you now
Lay in your bed, accept your fate

Here is the reason you should listen and learn

I know how the excitement and danger can thrill ya
But take it from somebody who knows
'cause after all the highs, you're gonna feel all the lows

You get to take her out and dig her out on a weeknight
Weekends, she wants to spend your ends
Her shopping spree is colossal, attitude semi-hostile

Her looks are a lullaby, to pass us by, she's too fly

She craves a wiseguy to help her gain amplify

Cause prior to this, he put rocks on her neck and wrist
Plus a fat joint on her finger
You best to have a batch of scratch and treats to bring her

You'll find yourself another jealous trick-ass boyfriend

Two: She said she didn't like my crew
Three: She never ever cooked for me
Four: She was my cherie amour -- YEAH RIGHT
It was all hype, I needed more insight
In retrospect, I know I slept from the first night
She did a split and that was it
Gave up my pimp license, and flipped my whole friggin script
But now I'm back like the Isley's moving wisely
Sizing up the situation, keeping honies waiting

I had on the beige Tims with the two tone leather
So we get to the jam, the gig, the venue
Then we circled around and then drove into
The front the place was packed the line was long
I was bobbing my head 'cause the music was on
I turned it down then I peeped to my right
I saw this kid and his girl having a fight
Another kid walked up and mushed the kid in his face
And then the kid pulled out and bust and laid him to waist
A riot broke out girls screaming and scheming crews
Started buck wilding trying to snatch kids jewels
After that Five-O came and turned the party out
And then an ambulance came to take the body out
And we didn't even get all the equipment out
And we didn't even get to turn the place out
This can happen often and it's really fucked up
So I'll ask you to your face, homeboy what's up?
Did you come to see my show or the stupid nigger playoffs?
Killing you and killing me, it's the soliloquy of chaos
Chaos
And if you live in the cities where streets reek warfare
People getting nowhere bot you go for yours there
You'll find it doesn't pay to front or play the role
You could get stole or maybe beat with a pole
Then you'll wanna retaliate, regroup and come back
So you set the brothers up for a sneak attack
Whether you die or kill them, it's another brother dead

And you bitches are mad 'cause you spit a facade
For sad niggas who thought hip-hop was really gone
But not for very long, I'm back to carry on

All I know is you attempted to be clever
Nevertheless, cleverness can't impress
'Cause now you've been expose like a person undressed

Rap is an art you can't own no loops
It's how you hook him up and the rhyme style troop
So don't even think you could say someone bit
Off your weak beat come on you need to quit
I flip lines and rhymes that never sound like yours
There ought to be laws against you yapping your jaws
Originality overflows in me
And the truth is, that you wish you could live the
Life I live and kick the lyrics I kick
But bear in mind that you can't think as quick
So Premier drops a beat, for me to says to verse two
And if I sound doper then take it personal
Don't be mad 'cause I don't come around the way
Like I used to, I don't have time these days
I'm keeping busy making power moves
Don't try to say I don't remember you
You shouldn't let your jealousy show like that
I stopped coming by, 'cause of the way you act

I used to hang with kids who like to live trife
With a knife, cuttin' kids for fun and pullin' out much guns
And like rivalry champs, fellas stop to get amped
Dead bodies lay stamped to the pavement, so I gave it
Some thought, rememberin' the brothers who are gone now
I'll make a strong vow to make things right
Ignite the mic, get hype and all that
Suckers try to menace but they always fall flat
To the ground as I astound, come around
I'll put you down about the brothers who think they're boss
Think they're gettin' large but in the end they pay the cost
Of their lives and that ain't the way to go out
Even take their boys with 'em 'cause they know their boys'll go out
But when it comes to facin' some time, they're like cryin' like weak

And brothers in the city have to live this way
It may cause dismay, but I'ma tell it anyway
Yo, guns are easy to get and like a puppet
Some young kid is gonna be the subject
Of internal oppression and example of hard times
To make it out the trap in your mind it's a hard climb
But even if your change come right and exact
There's another brother schemin' so just watch your back
I know a brother who thought he had it all
But little did he know he was bound for a downfall
He'd pick up the heater and go stick somebody
He wouldn't give a damn if he killed somebody
'Cause if somebody would get in the way of him gettin' loot
There'd be no hesitation, he'd just shoot
It's like the good, the bad and the ugly
Except it's reality and you don't see it on TV
Brothers keep dyin' in the streets 'cause the streets are designed
To keep you from havin' peace of mind
I know an old man, he's got a rifle to stifle any young punk
He hides it under his bunk
And I know a kid who's been to jail and
He told me that the system had failed him
So now he's out the joint and he's like flippin' on kids
And the people in his neighborhood are flippin' their wigs
But you gotta check the move 'cause there's a reason
A method to the madness and you know what I'm meanin'

You can be just like my man called holdin' a pump
But livin' like that you take a chance with your life
But some things in life sometimes will make you uptight
I'm like an avalanche of knowledge poundin' down all fools
All fakes, all snakes and ones who try to break the rules

For big stacks, watch your back when I send 'em in

Boom bash dash, I had to break, I had to getaway
Packed my bags, to leave for good, it was a monday
Kissed my mother, gave my pops a pound
Then he hugged me, and then he turned around
I threw the duffelbag over my shoulder
It was time to get props kid, cause now I'm older
Time to fend for myself jack
So i'ma go for mine, and maybe never come back
Stopped at the lye spot before I hit the train station
Needed some boom for the mental relaxation
It took the last of my loot to make this move troop
But I ain't even tryin to work in a suit
Plus my aunt's got a room that's for rent
As long as there's no hoes and I don't come home bent
So f**k the bullshit I'm audi
I'm on a mission, cause if I stay I'll go crazy
I'm gonna make it God damnit
Out in b-r-double-o-k-lyn, the planet
They never fake it just slam it
Out in b-r-o-o-k-lyn, the planet
Crash boom bang I used to hang at four corners
And all the spots in beantown where niggaz carry burners
But I was more turned on by the micraphone
So one cold morning, I left home
Next I'm smokin blunts on?
Or workin in a mail room uptown, feelin sick and
Tired, of payin all these f**ked up dues
I wasn't tryin to lose -- I refused
Had a chick uptown, one in queens and one in jersey
Sometimes all you need to get by, is a girlie
But yo I still wasn't happy
I seen a lot of ill shit on my block, happen nightly
East new york is no joke kid
And peace to my man hass doin his bad
I went to flatbush to buy incense and weed
Stopped at the bookstands for somethin to read
That shit was rough cause my pockets was bare
And like the sayin goes, sometimes life ain't fair
But in my heart there ain't no quittin
So I stayed up late, to write some rhymes to some rhythms
Seconds away from just flippin
But f**kit I'll maintain, one day I'll be hittin
See i'ma make it God damnit
Out in b-r-double-o-k-lyn, the planet
I'll never fake it just slam it
There in b-r-o-o-k-lyn, the planet
And you can, walk the walk talk the talk but don't flaunt
Cause little shorty's scheamin on your rings and fronts
But don't sweat it, cause that's the life out here
A lot of niggaz, be livin real trife out here
I got my own place in bed-stuy
Known to many others, as do or die
Malcolm x boulevard and gates avenue
Smokin up the fat trey bags with the crew
Me and the niggaz troy and squeaky
Used to twist dutch masters, we got nice weekly
I used to build with the brothers by the spot
They had to hustle but they still knew a lot
To get my haircut had to go to fort greene
On myrtle ave, to get a fade with the sides clean
Then to fulton just to look around
Just to roam around, and find a chick to go uptown
And check a movie or some shit like that
I couldn't spend much but yo my game was fat
I remember this one chick, she brought me a beeper
Then one week later, she got me some sneakers
But then I stepped, cause I found out about her rep
And I ain't goin out bein no bitch's pet
But anyway I used to lay up in the crib
Listening to red and marley, wishin I was on kid
Saved my dough, stayed on the down low
Lounged and drank 40's with tommy, hill and gunsmoke
And lil' dap used to come by strapped
Nice off a l cause we stayed like that
Sometimes I used to miss my moms
Gunshots in the twilight, people fightin every night
But i'ma be aight still
Cause i'ma keep writin shit and perfectin my skills
I'm gonna make it God damnit

Still another confrontation that you couldn't avoid
Prepare for drama, as if you were a stunt man
Back in the days you was a forty and a blunt man
Today you're a Willie, now the weather's too chilly
New York City ain't the place to be frontin
Over your shoulders day and night's where you look
Your so-called fam ran a scam, and you got shook

Too strong to be stepped on, creatively wise

Verse one: guru
I take action the minute that the crowd gets hype
I'm type crashin, down like a meteorite
I'm bogart-ing, mics and whole stages
Destroying mc's dreams, from words to whole pages
Their rapbooks, look more like scrapbooks
With their fictional fairytales and frail ass hooks
A lot of shit has happened, since I started rappin
There's been enough beef, and enough gat clappin
There's been mad signs, for this brother to heed
And while some choose greed, I choose to plant seeds
For your mental, spirit and physical temple
Bob your head to it, there's the water you've been lead to it
Bathe in it, a long time you've been cravin it
Prance to it, use your third eye and glance through it
Your state of being, becoming advanced through it
While others rhyme with no reason I be breezin
Their mics I seize them, then I try em for treason
I used to always like to hang out
Now I lounge in the rest writin bombs while tracks bang out
I know you peeped me in the club then
But now I'm in your speaker, with the voice that you're lovin

I put in work, and watch my status escalate
Now i'ma start collectin props, connectin plots
Networkin like a conference, cause the nonsense is yet to stop
Jakes shake me down, haters wanna take me down
Break me down, clap all they heard was the sound
Yo I scoped it out, I took your weak dream and choked it out
Your bitch don't really got no ass, she just poked it out
On the deelow, I'm sayin, you versus me though?
We can do this shit right here, in front of your people
See time is money kid, and bs walks
And to me, it's funny kid when you meet heads talk
I see feds stalk, they wanna dig up the dirt
Son is it me they hawk, cause I be puttin in work son?
Aiyyo I'm gonna be on ti-dop, that's all my eyes can see
Victory is mine, yeah surprisingly
I've been laying, waiting for your next mistake
I put in work, and watch my status escalate
You cornballs get stonewalled, blackballed I own y'all
The veteran, runnin my plan I'm the better man
Crazy raw, doin my job like the mob
Blazin y'all, and disappearin in the fog
Or a mist, and chicks can't resist what I kick
They be beggin for attention or some more of the dillznick
Word up baby, someone may have to get hurt up baby
Shit is mad shady, but I got to get the gravy
Platinum respect like the force of a tech
Keep you hittin the deck, feelin heat in your chest
Bangin your thoughts with the hot onslaught
A kid got shot on the spot for goin where he should not
Viciously, I make history, instantly
Those other lame ass loser ass niggaz, they can't fxck with me
I'm doin my thing now, to lamp later on
Paid in the shade, with some fly gators on
But now I'm grimy as they get, mud on my pants and shirt
I bet you niggaz out here know, I be puttin in work

You Know My Steez,Moment Of Truth,https://open.spotify.com/album/5f6Nz2v1DESbpu1NerEql2,1998,41796254,"That makes me know that what we're doing
We had the right idea in the beginning
And and we just need to maintain our focus and elevate
We what we do we update our formulas
We have certain formulas but we update em (oh right)
With the times and everything y'know
So y'know the rhyme style is elevated
The style of beats is elevated but it's still Guru and Premier
And it's always a message involved
The real (The real)
Hip-hop (Hip-hop)
MCing(MCing), and DJing (DJing)
From your own mind (from your own mind)
You know? (you know?)
I, I guess right now we should start the show
Who's the suspicious character
Strapped with the sounds profound
Similar to rounds spit by Derringers
You're in the Terrordome, like my man Chuck D said
It's time to dethrone you clones and all you knuckleheads
'Cause MC's have used up extended warranties
While real MC's and DJ's are a minority
But right about now, I use my authority
'Cause I'm like the Wizard, and you look lost like Dorothy
The horror be when I return for my real people
Words that split wigs hitting like some double Desert Eagles
Sporting caps pulled low, and baggy slacks
Subtracting all the rappers who lack over Premier's tracks
Severe facts have brought this rap game to near collapse
So as I have in the past, I whoop ass
Dropping lyrics that be hotter than sex and candlewax
And one-dimensional MC's can't handle that
While the world's revolving, on it's axis
I come with mad love and plus the illest warlike tactics
The wilderness is filled with this
So many people searching for false bliss
I'm here with the skills you've missed
The rejected stone is now the cornerstone
Sort of like the master builder when I make my way home
You know my steez
You know my steez
Let 'em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live, Keep it live)
To the beat y'all
The beat is sinister, Primo makes you relax
I'm like the minister, when I be lacing the wax
I be bringing salvation through the way that I rap
And you know, and I know, I'm nice like that
Work through worldly problems, I got the healing power
When the mic's within my reach, I'm feeling more power
Stealing at least three minutes of every rap radio hour
It's often easier for one to give advice
Than it is for a person to run one's own life
That's why I can't be caught up in all the hype
I keep my soul tight and let these lines take flight
The apparatus gets blessed
And suckers get put to rest
No more of the unpure, I got the cure for this mess
The wackness is spreading like the plague
MC's lucked up and got paid
But still can't make the fucking grade
How many times are wannabe's gonna lie?
Yo, they must wanna fry
They can't touch the knowledge I personify
I travel through the darkness, carrying my torch
The illest soldier, when I'm holding down the fort
You know my steez
(You know my steez)
Let em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live)
You know my steez
Let em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live)
You know my steez
Let em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live)
You know my steez
Let em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live)
The mic
On the microphone, you know that I'm one of the best yet
Some punks ain't paid all of their debts yet
Trying to be fly, riding high on the jet-set
With juvenile rhymes, making fake-ass death threats
Big deal, like En Vogue, here's something you can feel
Styles more tangible, and image more real
For some time now, I've held the scrolls and manuscripts
When it's time to go all out you be like, ""Damn, he flipped!""
Now I'm sick, fed up with the bullshit
Got the lyrical full clip, giving you a verbal asswhip
Don't trip, it's the gifted prolific one
Known as Bald Head Slick why is the press all on my di-dick?
My style be wilder than a kamikaze pilot
Don't try it, I'm about to start more than a frigging riot
Styles unsurpassable, and nuccas that's suckas
Yo, them motherfuckers are harrassable
For I be speaking from my parables and carry you beyond
The mic's either a magic wand
Or it gets tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb
Then I grab your palm, no pulse, you're gone
And if you thought we'd lose our niche
In this rap shit, you way wrong
I stay up, I stay on, shine bright, like neon
Your song's pathetic, synthetic, like Rayon
Fat beats, they play on, want dope rhymes, put me on
Word is bond

Yo I pop your lid, I got to live
I ain't tall but I can show y'all what a problem is
I like to zone, I'm nice with chrome
I keep a vast stash of Magnums cause I like to bone
I play the game, I stay the same
But I can switch styles, pick files, I'm like gravy train
Shot the witness, got the bitches
Still in the streets with my heat about to shock the business
I handle biz, I cancel kids
Just like Allen I'ma show 'em what ""The Answer"" is
I'm after props, I spaz a lot
And yo I'm deadin all the bullshit 'til my casket drops
You know me boy, you owe me boy
You wanna end up in my trunk dyin slowly boy?

""Step into my zone, mad rhymes'll stifle ya"" -> Guru
""No time for games cause I'm, all grown up"" -> DMX
""I speak that re-real shit, just listen""
(Verse Two: Guru)
It's conspiracy, you hearin me? That's why I get love
And still got others fearin me
You never know, who's next to blow
And since it's me, I'ma stash me some extra dough
Got extra flow, chicks give me sex and dough
Need I, mention P.I. player let me know
I'm down with dis, I founded this
So you should recognize the true authentic sound of this
The golden voice, holdin toys
But not playin, Guru and Preem', we like the golden boys
The chain and star, I'm angry pah
Cause you fucks ain't wanna give us what we aimin for
You stupid son, I shoot my gun
From the heart fool, you know that's where this music from
Protect your dome, respect the throne
This is Guru and Premier, and you can bet it's on

Shattered against the wall

I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
And I held my tongue as she told me,
""Son, fear is the heart of love.""
So I never went back

From Bangkok to Calgary
And the soles of your shoes are all worn down
The time for sleep is now
It's nothing to cry about
'Cause we'll hold each other soon
In the blackest of rooms

I wanna take you to that place in the ""Roche""
But no one gives us any time anymore
He ask me once if I'd look in on his dog
You made an offer for it, then you ran off
I got this picture of us kids in my head

""I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine""

It didn't matter what they wanted to see
He thought he saw someone that looked just like me
The summer memory that just never dies
We worked too long and hard to give it no time
He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
He runs his scissor at the seem in the wall
He cannot break it down or else he would fall
One thousand lonely stars hiding in the cold
Take it, I don't wanna sing anymore
""I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine""
I didn't want to anymore, oh oh oh

Says we have a deep connection-well it sure is news to me

She doesn't care if she has to scratch and claw to get in the door
She wants her 15 minutes of fame and 20 would be nice
But I guess it's her life

Never gonna give a warm embrace

God forgives, but not me

Got the world in my palm as I drop straight
I can't believe, I'm still alive
I've seen some things, I've seen the light
Close to death, and god's a myth?
The greatest trick that the devil ever told was proving that he don't exist
And the older I get, the more that the fate consists
Of sitting up on this fence
Between pain and bliss, where the pain exists with the happiness I missed
My final wish, I'm really hoping that I get, cause my last two would conflict
So I'm rubbing this lamp till my hand gets cramped and the genie pops out of it

I remember that night
I just might regret that night for the rest of my days
I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise
I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can't quite place
But Alexander, I'll never forget the first time I saw your face
I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said ""Hi"" I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, every part aflame
This is not a game
I'm sure I don't know what you mean, you forget yourself
Is that right?
Heard you've never been satisfied
My name is Angelica Schuyler
Where's your family from? Yes
Ooh-ooh-ah
So so so
So this is what it feels like to match wits with someone at your level
What the hell is the catch?
It's the feeling of freedom, of seeing the light
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite
You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Everything we said in total agreement
It's a dream and it's a bit a dance
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance
He's a bit of a flirt but I'mma give him a chance
I asked about his family did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance
He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants
Handsome, boy, does he know it
Peach fuzz and he can't even grow it
I want to take him for away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is
(Helpless)
And I know she is (Helpless)
And her eyes are just (Helpless)
And I realise three fundamental truths at the exact same time
(Number one)
I'm a girl in a world in which my only job is to marry rich
My father has no son so I'm the one who has to social climb for one
Cause I'm the oldest and the wittiest
And the gossip in New York City is insidious
And Alexander is penniless (haha)
That doesn't mean I want him any less
(Number two)
He's after me cause I'm a Schuyler sister that elevates his status
I'd have to be naive to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduced him to Eliza now that's his bride
Nice going Angelica, he was right, you will never be satisfied
(Number three)
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
He'd be mine
She would say ""I'm fine"", she'd be lying
But when I fantasise at night it's Alexander's eyes
As I romanticise what might have been
If I hadn't sized him up so quickly
At least she's his wife
At least I keep his eyes in my life
A toast to the groom, to the bride
From your sister who is always by your side
To your union and the hope that you provide
May you always be satisfied

And declared that she loved the clown madly

And this drove the clown wild
The poor little flea started crying
Never you mind his manager said
I ought not to tell but she's dyin'
Dyin' for love of you little flea
You've broken her heart with your lyin'

He'd tend her grave every hour

I'm down, no one to see me falling, I'm down
Had my ways with days of sunshine
Life came easy it all fell in line but then again I didn't realize
When you're used to one thing it's hard to accept another
Like the woman who brought you up, well, she ain't your mother
How do you cope with a thing like that
I'm down, no one to hear me calling
I'm down, no one to see me falling, I'm down
I always thought it was my dad who went to war
Thought it was my sister who fell off the wall
My pseudo brother Billy emigrated long ago
Someone went through pain to have me, someone I should know
I'm down, oh, I'm down, oh
To the folks who brought me up I'm not ungrateful
Kept the secret from me, they thought it was shameful
It hurt me so to be the last one to know
Maybe someones out there looking for me
Left on their own, couldn't afford to clothe me
And I, I don't even know my real name
I'm down, no one to hear me calling
I'm down, no one to see me falling, I'm down, I'm down, I'm down",https://open.spotify.com/track/0BwKdqUdFDKBLL16OElpsT,253,thehollies

Kisses changing frogs into princes.

Never explains what she wants it for

Come gather 'round people wherver you roam
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
If your time to you is worth saving,
Then you'd better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone,
For the times they are a-changing!
Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
And keep your eyes wide, the chance won't come again.
And don't speak too soon, for the wheel's still in spin,
And there's no telling who that it's naming.
For the loser now will be later to win,
For the times they are a-changing!
Come senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
There's a battle outside and it's raging.
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls,
For the times they are a-changing!
Come mothers and fathers, throughout the land,
And don't criticize what you can't understand.
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
Your old road is rapidly aging.
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand,
For the times they are a-changing!
The line it is drawn, the curse it is cast,
The slow one now will later be fast.
As the present now will later be past,
The order is rapidly fading.
And the first one now will later be last,
