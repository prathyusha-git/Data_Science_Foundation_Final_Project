Forcin' a light into all those stony faces left stranded on this warm july
And the boys from the casino dance with their shirts open like latin lovers on the shore
Chasin' all those silly new york virgins by the score

Those pier lights our carnival life forever
Oh love me tonight and I promise I'll love you forever
Oh I mean it sandy girl oh my baby
Hey sandy girl my baby
Sandy the waitress I was seein' lost her desire for me
I spoke with her last night she said she won't set herself on fire for me anymore
Did you hear the cops finally busted madame marie for tellin' fortunes better than they do
For me this boardwalk life is through you ought to quit this scene too

She goes away for a couple of days
So you phone a few number you fancy a change
You say you'll miss her but deep down inside
There are thoughts of another girl waiting somewhere for you
She's been away for a couple of days
The affairs weren't so good so you're mending your ways
You realise that there's nobody else who can do what she does for you
You tell yourself don't be a fool
Don't let her go chase as hard as you can
Or you'll be the loser
Swallow your pride you can still be a man
She'll never refuse you
She deserved to be loved, she wants to love you
If you went away you know she'd be true, yes you do.
Baby I was lonely, still love you only, but I was a bad boy
Know you couldn't see me, thought you'd never leave me, so I was bad boy
Even though I'm trying, there is no denying I am just a bad boy
Met a little baby, thought she was a lady, still I was a bad boy
She gives me everything a girl's supposed to do
She gives me everything still I can't be true
She gives me everything, she gives me everything
Going off to different places
All I see is different faces
I love them all but not like you
She deserves to be loved, she wants to love you
If you went away you know she'd be true, yes you do.
She deserves to be loved - Yes she does, you know she does
She deserves to be loved - Even if she goes away
She deserves to be loved - No one else can take her place
She deserves to be loved - You'll be the loser if you let her go
She deserves to be loved - She gives you everything a girl's supposed to do
She deserves to be loved - You love them all but she's the one for you
She deserves to be loved - Yes she does, you know she does
She deserves to be loved - Even if she goes away

Keep away from that hard-looking woman
Don't be fooled by her crocodile smile
She uses charm like a witch casting bad spells
You can't see what I can see for miles
I know she'll leave you with no self-respect
Builds you up only to destroy you
It'll happen at a time you won't expect
Don't let her leave you 'reject'
Sly girl, good timer, she's just a social climber
She bites
Entice, so nice, but you have to pay the price
She bites
She'll take away everything that you've got
leaving you cold when you think things are hot
Bad kind, no good, making up her own rules
Be on your guard, boy, if she loses her cool

Fifi the flea fell in love
With a clown from a flea circus fair
She gave him her heart
But he still couldn't see
That for such a long time she had cared
He put himself 'round all the other girl fleas
Unaware that he hurt her so badly
She cried in the arms of his manager friend
And declared that she loved the clown madly
One day Fifi went
And this drove the clown wild
The poor little flea started crying
Never you mind his manager said
I ought not to tell but she's dyin'
Dyin' for love of you little flea
You've broken her heart with your lyin'
She couldn't stand to see you throw
Her love away without tryin'
The day Fifi died the little clown vowed
He'd tend her grave every hour
He broke down and cried
When he saw her grave
And on it he placed a small flower
Poor little flea he wasted away
He'd lost his Fifi forever
So they opened her grave
Put him inside
Now at last they are together",https://open.spotify.com/track/1CSpedpDX2p0vqrUDi350E,127

She took a hold of my palm
She said Son you feel kind of warm
And then she looked into a crystal ball
She said You're in love
I said how could that be so
I'm not friendly with the girls I know
She said when the next one arrives
You gotta look into her eyes
I left there in a hurry
Looking forward to my big surprise
The next day I discovered
That the fortune teller told me lies
I rushed straight back to that woman
Just as mad as I could be
I said I didn't see nobody
Why'd she made a fool of me
Then something struck me
Like lightning from up above
While looking at the fortune teller
I fell in love
Now I'm a happy fella

Upon the street where mothers weep
The saviours who are fast asleep

And I wait for them to interrupt
Me drinkin from my broken cup
And askin me to open up the gate for you
Woh baby I want you
I want you

True love they've been without it

{Graham Nash sings 'bubbly' lead vocals}
Would you like to slide down a rainbow?
Catch a falling star in your hands?
Chase a moonbeam right by your window?
Close your eyes, and you'll be there.
In a land of dragons and castles,
be a knight in armor that shines,
on a horse with trappings of silver.
Close your eyes, and you'll be there.
You will be there.
Hoping that no one will come and wake you up.
You will be there.
While the mooning is peeping,
as you lie a-sleeping
in your dreamworld.
{interlude}
You will be there.
Hoping that no one will come and wake you up.
You will be there.
While the mooning is peeping,
as you lie a-sleeping
in your dreamworld.
See the witches fly on their broomsticks,
stirring cauldrons, casting their spells.
Kisses changing frogs into princes.
Close your eyes, and you'll be -
close your eyes, and you'll be -
close your eyes, and you'll be there.

Get out before the morning sun

Come gather 'round people wherver you roam
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
If your time to you is worth saving,
Then you'd better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone,
For the times they are a-changing!
Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
And keep your eyes wide, the chance won't come again.
And don't speak too soon, for the wheel's still in spin,
And there's no telling who that it's naming.
For the loser now will be later to win,
For the times they are a-changing!
Come senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
There's a battle outside and it's raging.
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls,
For the times they are a-changing!
Come mothers and fathers, throughout the land,
And don't criticize what you can't understand.
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
Your old road is rapidly aging.
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand,
For the times they are a-changing!
The line it is drawn, the curse it is cast,
The slow one now will later be fast.
As the present now will later be past,
The order is rapidly fading.

Now that you're here I'm beginning to smile
Why do they want us to walk when we can fly
Our love is burning inside
Why is it something that we have to hide
Why do they want us to walk when we can fly
We'll always feel the same
If they break us up we'll only have ourselves to blame
But we know they're playing games
What affairs to show we can make it go
If they only had wings
then they'd be sharing in all of our things

I press my nose against the pane
of the little toffee shop
Day after day I save my pennies
to spend at the toffee shop
Come Saturday morn at nine o'clock
I stand on the cold stone street
A penny every day that I have saved
to buy myself some sweets
The nice little lady old and grey
with glasses and shawl
Gives love away to good little boys
who do as they are told
She's always telling stories
of her childhood days
She couldn't buy the things that I can
for families in those days
Imagine the sweets that I can buy
with six pennies of my own
I always take my time to choose
the sweets that I'll be taking home
Gobstoppers in my pockets
brown sugar in my hand
lollies you suck that last all day
and sugar that looks like sand",https://open.spotify.com/track/4cwiw1wU9z1BvO4GdIUWlz,137
