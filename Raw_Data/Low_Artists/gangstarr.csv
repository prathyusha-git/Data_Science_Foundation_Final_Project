2 Deep,Daily Operation,https://open.spotify.com/album/74DwNAuirHLDLVLrBQAnVg,1992,1092642,"I'm too deep, and yes much too complicated
My lines when stated are quite often underrated
So consider it a privilege to hear this
The weak-minded opinions could never come near this
For my outlook on life is a profound view
While the suckers act down thinkin' that they sound new
Only a few sound true, me and the crew know who
'Cause see me and the fellas have been waitin' for a while now
Givin' you the time to get your wack-ass style down
You punks pop junk as if life is a fantasy
Knowin' that hard is somethin' you can't be
So you front, but you can never call my bluff
You catch hell kid, you get dealt with
I never sleep, I always peep, rhymes creep
I'm too deep, I'm too deep, I'm too deep
I forgive you, psych! I'm takin' your life
'Cause you continue to disrespect so I'ma get trife
But then again I think I'll spare ya
'Cause I know that all it takes is one rhyme just to scare ya
♪
See I'm the holder of the key
Don't ask me if I'm Muslim, don't say nothin' to me
I said I was raised like one son, I had two cousins
They pushed me to find myself or else they knew I wasn't
Gonna make it, and then end up a statistic
My life was twisted, I almost missed it
The chance, yes the chance to make you feel good
I used to steal goods and fake my parents out real good
But now I got K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E of self 'cause I'm me
And the Nation of Islam has my support
'Cause they try to re-educate ones who are lost
And the Five Percent Nation takes other steps
To get through to the brothers on the corners with the reps
And in the prisons, givin' the brothers new visions
Of how we can gain wealth and gain self-esteem
And dream, of a total different scene
I dress clean, stand lean, say what I mean and I'm out
Like a scout on a new route, exhibiting clout
I never sleep, I always peep, rhymes creep
I'm too deep, I'm too deep, I'm too deep
♪
But right now, yo, my religion is rhymin'
Perfect timin', test the flow then climb in
Ansaar, Sunnite, Shiite, Jihad
All must regard that times are hard
United Pharisees the message that I cherish
That goes for my people of all religions
If we're all black, why have so many divisions?
Superficial factors are drivin' us apart
Don't let it happen, let's put some respect back in
So, before I act I think, 'cause it's the brink of destruction
World corruption, what's up son?
Your gun is just one, and I just might have one
Or two, or maybe even three or four
Plus an army of about one hundred or more
But violence, is never my first choice
I come in peace to release the effect of my voice
I never sleep, I always peep, rhymes creep

Above The Clouds,Moment Of Truth,https://open.spotify.com/album/5f6Nz2v1DESbpu1NerEql2,1998,104149148,"It has come to our attention that a mysterious force is loose
Somewhere in outer space
The mysteries of creation are there
(Up in the sky?) Up in the sky
The moon and the planets are there
And new hopes for knowledge and peace are there
And therefore as we set sail, we ask God's blessing
On the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure
Of which man has ever embarked
Our self-lord and master shall bring disaster to evil factors
Demonic chapters shall be captured by kings
Through the storms of days after
And to the earth from the sun through triple darkness to blast ya
With a force that can't be compared to any firepower
For its mind power shared, the brainwave causes vessels to circulate
Like constellations reflect at night
Often late, word to the father and mother earth
Seek an everlasting life through this hell for what it's worth
Look, listen, and observe, and watch another sea cycle pullin'
My peeps to the curb, heed the words
It's like ghetto-style proverbs
The righteous pay a sacrifice to get what they deserve
Cannot afford to be confined to a cell, brainwaves swell
Turnin' a desert to a well, experience is the best teacher
Thoughts will spray like street sweepers
Little daddy street preacher, illustrious feature, narrator you select
Accompanied by deck, plus the DJ you respect
It's seven and a half combined, over the front line
The ten-percenters, promotin' slander in the airtime
Bear in mind, jewels be the tools of the trade, sharp blades
Heavenly praise, and dues are paid, above the crowds
Above the clouds, where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles, warriors spiritual
Above the clouds, rainin' down, holdin' it down
Yeah, I leave scientists mentally scarred, triple-electro lords
Wild like rock stars who smash guitars, poison bars from the guards
Bust holes in your mirage, and catch a charge
Shake them down like the riot squad, invasion zone
Ruin like ancient Rome, I span the universe and return to earth
To claim my throne, the maker, owner, plus sole controller
Ayatollah, rest in the sky, the clouds, my sofa
Stand like colossus, regardless to whom or what
Numerous attempts in my life, so who to trust, who but us
To supply you with the fire, the burning truth, 150 absolute proof
On the mic like Moses, spoken golden scribe, survivor of the oldest tribe
Whose soldiers died, I know the five families, we shed tears and mourn
But our heads are on the ammo, 'cause the battle's still on
Sound the horn, we come rumbling through the function
Precise laser beam technique to touch something
When we die hard, they build a monument to honor us with
Humongous effect on the world, we could've conquered it
Above the clouds, above the clouds
Where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles, warriors spiritual
Above the clouds raining down, holding it down
Above the crowds above the clouds
Where the sounds are original infinite skills
Create miracles warriors spiritual above
The clouds raining down holding it down",https://open.spotify.com/track/3ZBSXNYdTZVaBUQI3E2rF6,221

So stay attentive, cause this is a new joint
From the G-A-N-G with the info
Lyrical elements emerge from the intro
Forming a poetic mass over pathetic trash
Other writers are outclassed
Surpassed by the words and the wit
Rhymes fit and hit cause that's how we designed it
Page for page, we are the new age
Dope in the videos and dope when we're on stage
Commanding respect with my ink pen while suckers are sinking
as I'm keeping them thinking
Narrating phrases of value, and I can see now you
relate to what I create
From back in the days of my youth, I've looked for the truth
And yo my rhymes are the real proof
New heights and new realms have been reached
by use of my speech along with one of Premier's beats
So listen and we'll show you the best way
and then sway, as I read my S-A
(DJ Premier cuts and scratches again)
(Guru)
Worshipful words giving insight, so just be observant
so you can get this right
My oratory gift is abundant, so dazzling to minds
that you should come get
a glimpse of the one who puts wimps out of work
The script is a mess and they dress like they're jerks
Beyond them, is where I'll be dwellin
The Guru will tell em, why their records ain't sellin
Placin my fingers on the tool, I runaway all fools
when I'm dispersin a verse
Think of an enjoyable moment, then boogie your body
Cause this party I own it
The origin of this is on paper
Vibes will ascend from my mind to each line
I go with the flow as I show expertise
The powers increase as my voice hits the streets
Then gripping your soul with authority
I pour these rhymes in a cup so drink up
And then I might bring another round
Watch the sound pound from the floor to the ground
And keep aware, cause we'll show you the best way

It's like, a friendship, and a business partnership
And, we have to always be concious of the difference
Between em; because y'know, some things can happen
That'll ruin one or the other, so
We alwa-we always stay concious of those things
Those obstacles that can, y'know trip us up
Because we ain't trying to go out like that

C'mon! Motherfucker! Yeah! ...
GangStarr! GangStarr! M.O.P.
Ghetto people!
Son you're supposed to be my man, but you ain't wise enough to realize
This is B.I., see I wanna taste the whole cake
Some things in this industry, shit be so fake
Make no mistake, if you're my man you'd understand
About the plan, to stack hundreds of grands (That's right!)
And how to stand, on much more acres of land
And to expand from the days of goin hand to hand
So like I was CEO I do my thing son
And turn this underground rap thing to my kingdom
Release a fistful, of rhymes for the fiscal year
MC's are wishful fuckin with this here
They stuck with the tear, for fear they foresake a brother's love
It's clear -- I'd have to be the better man I'm thinkin
The 7th Letter Man ain't got no time for petty speakin (uhh)
So we go our seperate ways I see the fork in the road
I know I blessed you with a portion of gold
And some good fortune to hold, so KEEP THAT
While I keep it movin, just like truckloads
Of interstate cargo, taxin niggaz like U.S. embargoes
You my man like I said so all the best
You shoulda known we do shit differently than all of the rest
Can't afford to let a link be, loose in the chain
It's time for us to get mad more, juice in the game
You're buggin son (that's right) that's word to Billy and Fame
So I'ma stay the game, that we play to win (Yeah!)
So I don't care what you say to her or say to him
The object son, is to excel and lead
And niggaz be bluffin fallin for nothin but greed
Chorus: M.O.P. and Guru

I'm true to myself y'all, and I'm a down ass nigga!
So don't fool yourself, clown ass nigga!
I always been the type of cat that'll put it on ya
Since back in the days when Laze snatched me off the corner
And every since then, the whole game changed
Everybody's against, Lil' ass Fame
They wanna see me stretched out with my back smokin
Left for dead in the street with my back opened
So I don't keep friends I just roll with
Niggaz I was RAISED WITH, went out in a BLAZE WITH
In the penile, to B.ville, down to Grayson
And we thick together, in these last days kid
So I don't have what you call friends
Cause when it's on then they gone in the end!
But I'ma handle my business indeed
Cause niggaz be bluffin fallin for nothin but greed!
Hey yo what happened to the love soldier? It never crossed my mind
That you would doubt my love inside and test my pride
I divide, anything that I got
With my M.O.P. staff -- WE ALL AND WE OUT!
To the First Family loyalty, is no game
We them type of niggaz that, money won't change
We all aim, for the big picture
But to me it don't mean shit if your dogs ain't witcha
I sacrifice my main arteries -- WHY NIGGA?!
Ain't nobody never loved me, like my niggaz
See my business is my friendship and my friendship is my business
Can I get a witness?! (Preach on nigga!)
Hey yo we went through all out wars, half-assed tours
Travelled 'cross this land with heavy contraband
(See you my man!) And you ain't never got to
Second guess or question the love of William Danze (Sho' nuff!)
I am invaluable, to my niggaz
Cause they all rest there in thirty-two -- BETTER THAN NOTHIN!
Think of William when they start bustin, I hold you down

And each and everyday around the way gats bust
And jealous so-called friends'll try to set you up

Check the horror scene
The kid was like twelve or thirteen
Never had the chance like other kids to follow dreams
Watched his father catch two in the dome and to the spleen
Nothin' but blood everywhere, these streets are mean
They spared his life, but killed his moms and his sister Jean
Of course over some drug shit
His pops was on some ill-out, spill your guts, on some thug shit
Didn't know his boys was on some shady ass no love shit
His pops got played out though, with silencers they laid him out yo
Took his stash and all the cash and left 'em, tied up on the couch yo
With tape over his mouth, so he couldn't cry out
Cause his dad was the nigga with clout
Survival of the fittest so they split his wig no doubt
Despite the stocking caps he noticed the same cat, who used to give him dough
And taught him, to use the same gat
Supposed to be an Uncle, fam and all that
He could tell that it was him cause he had on the same slacks, he wore when
He took him to Meadowlands racetrack

Flip big Benz's, flossin all gators
Had it all mapped out, 6-8, 12th grader
Fresh outta school, he fin' to go lay paper
He had abrother who was hustlin collectin his change
Never let his baby brother stick his neck in the game
Told him all he had to do is just enjoy the ride
And he ain't have to worry about money cause that's in time
So now he's pacin as the time moves slowly
Can't wait to face Shaquille in the paint and school Kobe
Kept his grades and stayed up under neighborhood functions
And then a group of knuckleheads came through dumping
So now he's sittin on the sidewalk bleeding
Fell into a puddle of his own blood and stopped breathin
And everybody in the neighborhood still grievin
But destiny caught up with his ass and he got even
And all the cryin in the world ain't goin to bring him back
His brother, sittin at the wake wipin tears from his mother's eyes
Why'd the game have to go and take the young boys life
Only the wicked live shife, payin the price
While he's starin at the shell
His brothers soul wants hell the trigger man made bail
And you, wouldn't pay the boys mail, and sacrificed the fuckin family

The shortest length between two points is a straight line

Science, math, history theology
Philosophy psychology english and biology

Whatever turns you on I guess, that's why vests are in season

Than be there when they close the place down

Simply go buckwild, get crazy and mad

Growin more and more nervous when I serve this ass whoopin
Comin straight out of brooklyn, baldhead from the old school
Born to rule with more class than billy dee
To a pussy emcee, you know a wuss emcee
I'm like his worst nightmare when I'm on my killin spree
Pick the vic, who will it be?

Your vote may hold the key
It's up to you, tell us true
Who'll be, herb of the day?
(Guru)
And your fake, you break, when suckers choose, they lose
I'm like lethal, to you and your people
It's like an outrage, when punks step on stage
With the weak show, weak flow, and still make dough
So i'ma take dough from em, and then stum em
Teach em how to really get biz like this
Me and my gang's gonna swarm... brainstorm
""Get on it"" --> dj premier flips it again
(Guru)
It takes at least, two to tango, so you can get strangled
From any angle, as I get buck on ducks
All the, sexy girlies wanna push up close to
The man with the most who don't flaunt his ego
Some motherf**kers ain't as gifted
Not everyone can move the crowd and uplift it
I'm swift with the shit like a bullet's trajectory
So don't stand next to me
It's like a, warm sensation when my shells hit
You were wrong, you know what you did so you fell quick
To the pavement, no signs of body movement
See I knew it, yo I had to do it
And it's, cool to duel but don't slip up fool
Cause i'ma leave you dead and stinkin like a sesspool
And all the chicks know what's goin on
Cause baby, there ain't no sunshine when I'm gone
And you can beg for me to stay and parlay
But sorry, I gots to go, got bills to pay
See by nature I'm godly
When I touch the mic, it's never too hard for me
To let out, a mastermind of mad clout
Huh, me and my gang's gonna swarm... brainstorm
""Get on it"" --> dj premier displays turntablism skills
(Guru)
I'm gonna get ya
You might be bigger than me, so i'ma wet ya
Come into your house to douse it with the
Malatov cocktail, I won't fail
Burn out your eyeballs, and leave a note in braille
So what the f**k you gonna do?
Yea I know I used to act relaxed but now I'm cuckoo
Come into my darkest deepest thoughts
We fought I won, and now you're caught and bein tortured
Water pellets dripped upon your forehead
But you can't move, because you're tied up

Most of them corny as hell, they won't get paid a dime
A lot of these punks, they all sound the same
They all sound lame, fakin' like they down with the game
Against me, they fail

I leave 'em slumped, and their bodies dumped over the rail
Show me respect, then cut me a fat check
You little niggas are like virgins, you haven't had ass yet
Wet behind the years while I've been spittin' darts for years

Cold or hot? Truth or trash?
War or peace? Longevity or cash?
Here's one for SPIN, Billboard, and Rolling Stone
Hip Hop is so organic, it'll grow on its own
We watch 'em throw money at it with clout and power
But after a while, things faded out and went sour
Somebody lost their shirt, execs got fired
Some artist went berserk, took mad drugs and got wired
Hundreds of thousands, up to millions in promo
All wasted on garbage, now, that was a no-no
Oh no, what's gonna happen now to these fools?
These self-centered pricks were showered, proud of 'em too
Never that, 'cause I am the renegade realist
Street visionary, the end of days idealist
People often ask what's the key to longevity
How I'm so consistent and bring the heat incredibly
Intelligence is vital and always stay hood

You hear the tickin' and the tockin' on the digital watch
Yeah, time is money, and they don't find it funny
They'll show up where you live, make your environment bloody, buddy
They'll kick in the door, tell you ""Get on the floor""
They bust a .9 and bust some rhymes, you like, ""gimme some more""
Askin' you where your heart is, but you an artist
You was never as hard as you said you was
Maybe lyin', wasn't the smartest decision you ever made
'Cause this business ain't regulated
If you beefin' over beats in these streets, you'll never make it
Now you singin' to cops, that's your favorite tune, nigga
They ain't got Yelp reviews for goons, nigga

Plannin' to examine you on a Petri dish
Stickin' you and frickin' you, just a teeny bit
I'm clever with science, but never relyin'
On false words from cowards who forever be tryin'
Insistin' they come off, I let 'em get some off
Then come back with drum tracks their ears could get numb off
Blockbustin', like makin' love I'll never stop thrustin'
Into your system, so just listen
I'm like a neurosurgeon, operatin' with a purer version
I write prescriptions of words that fit in
They don't get prescribed as I kick it live

I'm rushin' you like a defensive end
As I recommend that you comprehend
I could stomp you in a battle, contest, or war
What will occur will be the portraiture of your immature
Insecure for sure meek weak visions of grandeur
To really awaken you, I then will be breakin' you
Taxin' without action, extractin' the snake in you
Makin' you succumb to the drums of Gang Starr
By far we are truly gifted ones, son
But if you were to speculate or estimate us losin'
You'll be dyin', tryin' to face the fate of your delusions

So I'm trumpin', puntin' punks just like footballs

To wish and fish for a style, here's a fishin' rod
These rhymes are hittin' hard, constantly I'm gettin' large
Inevitably, I readily kick a spree
Of lyrics so deep, so don't sleep, but just peep me
Puttin' methods on records, expandin' for each millisecond
Thirty-three RPMs displays the art of men
And as my rhymin' builds, you see my time is chill
And then I look upon weak ones

'Cause in the life they're living, you can't half step
It starts with the young ones doing crime for fun
And if you ain't down, you'll get played out, son
So let's get a car, you know, a fly whip
Get a dent, pull a screwdriver, and be off quick
With a dope ride, yeah, and a rowdy crew
We can bag us a Benz and an Audi, too
Even a jeep or a van, goddamn, we're getting ours, yo
Take a trip up the strip, and be like stars, so
It doesn't matter if the cops be scoping
They can't do jack, that's why a young brother's open
To do anything, anywhere, anyplace
Buckwild in another court case
It's the code of the streets
They might say we're a menace to society
But at the same time, I say, ""Why is it me?""
Am I the target for destruction?
What about the system, and total corruption?
I can't work at no fast-food joint
I got some talent, so don't you get my point?
I'll organize some brothers and get some crazy loot
Selling D-R-U-G-S and clocking dollars, troop
'Cause the phat dough, yo, that suits me fine
I gotta have it so I can leave behind
The mad poverty, never having, always needing
If a sucker steps up, then I leave him bleeding
I gotta get mine, I can't take no shorts
And while I'm selling, here's a flash report
Organized crime, they get theirs on the down low
Here's the ticket, wanna bet on a horse show?
You gotta be a pro, do what you know
When you're dealing with the code of the streets
Nine times out of ten I win, with the skills I be weilding
Got the TEC one dealing, let me express my feelings
Guru has never been one to play a big shot
It's just the styles I got that keep my mic hot
I fucked turning my back to the street scene
It gives me energy, so I'ma keep fiends
Coming, just to get what I'm selling
Maybe criminal or felon dropping gems on your melon
So keep abreast to the Gang Starr conquest
Underground ruffnecks, pounds of respect
I've never been afraid to let loose my speech
My brothers know I kick the code of the streets",https://open.spotify.com/track/2mLjLAlChZXZpIZfyPF8Le,209

But fuck that, I be wylin sometimes - you know why?

Niggaz be thinkin that rap niggaz ain't real, haha
Yeah well that's aight, that's aight
Let 'em think what they want
(Verse One: Guru)
Yo I'm steady at it, them deadly habits
I pray for the best outcome son, but my dome's already shattered
By the shit that's occurred
Drivin home tipsy from the club, puffin herb, vision blurred
Thinkin bout them niggaz who caught the drop
Who I gotta stop, who he caught, and who still gotta get popped
Stash box, feelin like Fish in ""King of New York""
Wifey do her thing for the God, she don't be bringin me pork
Cause there's enough deadly shit a brother be facin
Up in V.I.P., niggaz drinks they be lacin
Got a nigga sweatin pacin, not ready to fall the fuck up
But ready to pull out, and back 'em all the fuck out
And my guardian angel, is always there to protect
And my supreme nature, keeps all them savages in check
How the hell did everything get so twisted
They say be careful what you pray for, so I guess now it's this shit
(Chorus: Guru)
They will never know - what I do to get by
And them many times I almost died
They will never know - all the reasons why I flip
And now I gotta keep an extra clip
They will never know - what this stress is like
And why I'm on point, ready to fight
They will never know - all the pressure and pain
Don't give a fuck if they think less of me mayne
(Verse Two: Guru)
Deadly habits, they could be a number of things
Everybody got 'em, some people do ugly things
Excessive behaviour, it can get the best of you
Trust me, I'm a lot like the rest of you
I got issues, that haven't been resolved
You know like, money people owe me while they out havin a ball

Got me on a mission, to go and merk, each and every faggot
Manager's coked up, A&R's all doped up
Old school style, have 'em gagged up and roped up
Those deadly habits have me losin my cool
But yo the Son can't chill, so I'ma be abusin them fools

Fuck you wanna do, we way past 7: 30
Be easy, too many brothers seem to go to heaven early
It's hell in these streets, but soon I'm on a hot streak
Who's in the hot seat, who had a felony beef
Yo I beat cases, with different attorneys
And I laughed at the racist DA's, who were wishin to burn me
My mom caught a heart attack, around the same time
News articles were published, around the same time
This depressed me more, but I stayed in tact
And that last corny chick I was with, she got played in fact
I know niggaz that did dumb time, and dumb crimes
I fuck with real niggaz, and never cowards with dumb minds

And disease runs rampant, so many men carry arm
So many have a lonely painful road to travel on
Mothers losing sons, improper use of guns
Children go astray because their parents were abusive ones
I used to run with the illest guys
Thourgh the realest eyes
I seen the realest and the illest die
The cycle continues, so many times the good ones

So many misunderstood ones
Remembering their faces and voices

Ex-Girl To Next Girl,Daily Operation,https://open.spotify.com/album/74DwNAuirHLDLVLrBQAnVg,1992,6318988,"You know I used to be a player, fly girl layer and a heart breaker
Love maker, back breaker, but then I made a mistake
Yes I fell in love with this ill chick
Sweatin' me for money, my name and the dilsnick
My homeboys told me drop her, 'cause it would be to my benefit
She used to say I'd better quit hanging with those derelects
Romancing is my thing but I can't swing with no scheming hoes
Wherever my Beemer goes you know that I'm driving
Surviving in the 90's is a must so I trust
That everyone listen up as my vocals give thrust
I bust my rhymes first never chasing a skirt
Do much work while other suckas need more time to rehearse
Now back to the ex-girls, ex-lovers, ex-friends
It made me mad to find that she was only after my ends
She phones me and goes on about her new life now
I wish she knew right now, I think she's busted let's discuss it
When I was with her no trust, just fights
Just the he-say-she-say and the neighborhood highlights
Now I got my new girl or as I say my baby doll
But still I'm gettin' crazy calls, my ex-girl's got balls
Don't wanna play the field 'cause I get lovin' at home base
Don't gimme no long face just exit with grace
You and I are the past, c'est la vie, much respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl, 'cause I'm on with the next girl
'Cause girls look so good, next
'Cause girls look so good, next
'Cause girls looks so, so, so good, next
'Cause girls look so good, next
'Cause girls look so good, next
'Cause girls look so, so good, next, next
She had much loot liked to buy me fresh-dipped gear
Liked to have me near 'cause of my savoir faire
The time we shared was brief 'cause I needed relief
From her high-classed antics and all her conceit
Now she's crying wolf and I like don't wanna hear that
I told her the bear facts when things started out
She wines and she pouts about how I did her bad yo
But she'd tried to buy me, even tempt me with the hiney
I fell for a sec 'cause the clothes were real fly
I could almost feel I would give into her whims
Her thoughts were erratic, sporadic, crazy in nature
I told her, hey look, yo I can no longer date ya
Tried to pimp me with bank and fell short, your ship sank
Many thanks for the time and the watch and the link
You and I are the past, c'est la vie, 'nuff respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl 'cuz I'm straight with the next girl
'Cause girls look so good, next
'Cause girls look so good, next
'Cause girls looks so, so, so good, next
Looks, looks, looks
Looks, looks, looks
Looks, looks, looks
So good
You saw my mom's in the supermarket and gave her your number
You asked how's my sister, then asked how's my brother
Didn't ask about my father 'cause you know he ain't like ya
Every time I left for your crib yo he'd really get hyper
The advice he used to give me makes much sense now
I can't believe I used to let you break my confidence down
You used to ask me why the hell did I wanna live in Brooklyn?
You messed up my flow although you were good-lookin'
Yes darlin', was fly and this was the problem
'Cause back in the day she had me scheming and robbin'
To get her things to wear so when she went to the club
All eyes were on her and oh me I just bugged
Caught in between felling proud or feeling more like a sucker
Had to go undercover, get away, find another
Been in Brooklyn nine years and been around the world too
I've seen so many fly girls and I knew just what to do
I went from ex to the next, took my time with each one
And you know they still love me so stop jellin' me hon
I went home to see my mom and I saw you at the bus stop
Must I stop? Nah I think not
You and I are the past c'est la vie, much respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl and I'm out with the next girl
'Cause girls looks so good, next
'Cause girls looks so good, next
'Cause girls looks so, so, so good, next
'Cause girls looks so good, next
'Cause girls looks so good, next

Treatin niggaz dumb, as I drink my rum

Tell me, do you have a clue of what to do
Can you groove to this smooth tune, you must presume
it's important, for you to follow this creation
And hey Son, life is more than having fun
So run and get some help with the problems that you face
Take a taste of the bass put your perspective in place
Get real, deep, so you can keep involved
Revolve and solve, so you can make the calls
like a supervisor he who is wiser than the others
Cause they need someone to advise them to discover
things that they don't know so the papers I will check
Then they'll start to grow to this form of intellect
(DJ Premier cuts ""individual with intellect"" --> unknown)
(Guru)
When the road is too steep, do you have the stamina
First album took us two weeks, since then we have been plannin
an exclusive attraction, produce it to your satisfaction
Those of you lackin, we will put you back in your slime
so you can think and get a grip of
yourself by yourself, and then you'll get a sip of
a gift that's equipped with the script that shocks
You can take a walk? on God?
With your mouth wide open, hoping you can find a
way to display similar actions in a kind of mockery
Cause you don't realize the cost to be
creative genius please, I'm too clean to play
Glance per chance, watch GangStarr perfect
And dance your pants like champs, to this form of intellect

Valuable solutions, we invent here
Break and remake the cupcakes to show we've been sent here
to serve you, so swallow this and bite it
And why bring, ignorance when we're inviting
you to get advancement, while you're on the dance tip
And don't you know the transcript will make you shake hips
Or chill at will, and with skill, you'll learn some etiquette
Better get the subject or be last at the predicate
And get a set, of headphones and speakers
As lyrical lessons manifest, I will keep you
abrest of the best, in this rap mess
Oversaturated market, full of wackness

Don't choke, and don't turn blue in a frenzy

spontaneous cuts, but not mainly just that
It's the scratching format, exact with maddening accuracy
Craftily, on the side or in back of me
Nastily, as if his name was Dick Dastardly

Uh-huh, it was you and your crummy corny ass crew
So we shall enforce that you lost
And plus you oughta find another type of life
And yes, another source of income, here's some advice
You can't rap this nice, I broke ya over and over
I told ya I would mold ya, why? (Put it on 'em!)
Because I'm bound to give original sound as your ears pound
Bringin' pleasure and pain and brains start to gain
From musical measures, formin' stanzas, combining
Providing answers to mystical questions
Never typical inventions
Developed by my gifted, unlimited mind
Suckers wanna talk, but they mimic the rhyme
'Cause they're eager to find the secret behind
The way that I stomp all comp just like a Timberland
It's the Guru and Premier, it's them again
Droppin' fly tracks and takin' things over
And never sellin' out, 'cause I'm the hardcore composer

Misled by the lies that they pump in their heads
The money and the fame that they're hopin' to find
Will never come close to the scope of my rhyme
Now, some have been successful, but really?
And yo, these MC's are clearly not nearly
Up to this level, or should I say caliber?
It's just some hype that the company's sellin' ya
'Cause they'll take a dud talkin' crud and they'll push him
But in the next year, someone new will just squish him
'Cause when you sell out to appeal to the masses
You have to go back and enroll in some classes
So cash in your check, 'cause it's the last one you get
The tables have turned and now you ain't in effect
So jet to the rear, and you better just follow
'Cause what's here today, may be gone tomorrow
""You wack MCs""
""Haha, see you later""
""You wack MCs""
""Haha, see you later""
Here and gone in a flash
Some make cash while other suckers go broke real fast
Some never make any money, but still they act funny
Like they're thinkin' they're runnin' things
Wearin' rings and medallions
Then listen to their rhymes, one would rather take Valiums
'Cause swiftness and skills, they are lackin'
So I'll send 'em packin', they should've known I'd be taxin'
And smashin' all of their vocals to smithereens
Watchin' them collectin' themselves is a bitter scene
But some find happiness, while others find sorrow
And what's here today, may be gone tomorrow

His power is so great
That's for real
Ain't about a whole lotta talk
It's, it's, it's about, about, it's, it's about a-a-action, can you dig it?
He got the eye and the heart to do it, yeah
From the roof with a scope, there's a whole art to it
Ain't no emotion when he pulls the trigger
Brief second of silence, then you see what he do to niggas
Pistols, rifles, grenades, whatever
He's a killin' machine, bought and paid for and clever
And way iller than the last nigga
Smoke a nigga in the club then dance right past niggas
Once in a while, there'll be one who'll stand out
Who's more than psycho, who'll take any man out
With a certain passion for sendin' bullets blastin'
A certain fashion to the way this nigga wax 'em
And this assassin gets mad satisfaction
From puttin' all this worthless scum out of action
A sense of pride in his skill
Looks in the mirror and salutes before he rides for the kill
You got the bag, pop? I got the thing-thing
It's in the sling, here it is, let me let it ring
With the doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Or do it lawn mower style, rrt
You got the bag, pop? I got the thing-thing
It's in the sling, here it is, let me let it ring
I got potatoes and the mufflers in the whole thing
With the fwt, doo-pa, doo-pa, doo-pa, doo-pa, doo-pa, doo-pa
Buckin' at niggas wigs while he's puffin' on cigs
Lay him down, then he bounce out of town to another gig
It ain't nothin', he don't need many friends
Funded different type of weapons, he got plenty of them
If you pass him on the street or see him in his spot
He's always calm, cool, collected, very rarely is he not
Hit man, with ice in his veins
Does the job so precise they up the price with his name
Shadowy figure, never too loose with the lip
Forty-four long in his coat, deuce-deuce on his hip
Baby nine in his boots and his trunk is full
This nigga's on some shit and can't be fucked with, fool
In the grimy world of highly-paid hustlers
First they get goons to muscle ya, then get him to touch ya
You wouldn't wanna get in his way, nor his associates
Or a tombstone bearin' your name will be appropriate
You got the bag, pop? I got the thing-thing
It's in the sling, here it is, let me let it ring

You see the mic in my hand, now watch me wreck it now
What is a party if the crew ain't there?
(What's your name kid?) Call me Guru, that's my man Premier
Now many attempts have been made to hold us back
Slander the name, and withhold facts
But I'm the type of brother with much more game
I got a sure aim, and if I find you're to blame
You can bet you'll be exterminated, taken out, done
It doesn't matter how many, they go as easy as just one
Bust one round in the air for this here
'Cause this year, suckers are goin' nowhere
'Cause my street style and intelligence level
Makes me much more than just an angry rebel
I'm gifted, unlimited, rhymes universal
MC's that ain't equipped get flipped in my circle
I'm aimin' on, rainin' on those bitch-ass chumps
'Cause their rhymes don't flow and their beats don't pump
And niggas better know I paid my dues and shit
I'm 'bout to blow the fuck up 'cause I refuse to quit
I'm out to get the props that are rightfully mine
Yeah, me and the crew think it's about that time
But on the D-L you know that Gang Starr will conquer
That's why you stare and point and others cling on to
My Nautica, askin' for a hookup
Well sorry, but my schedule is all booked up
Nobody put me on, I made it up the hard way
Look out for my people but the suckers should parlay
'Cause it's business, kid, this ain't no free-for-all
You have to wait your turn, you must await your call
So now, now, it is my duty to
Eliminate and subtract all of the booty crews
And suckers should vacate before I get irate
And I'll kick your can from here to Japan
With force you can't withstand 'cause I'm the motherfuckin' man
Right now I got my man Lil Dap from the Group Home
Ayo, step up to the mic and tell 'em why you're the man
So much anger built inside
So don't stop to say hi, motherfucker, just die
My shit holds a mouthful so I guess you know what's up
While punks get killed at the end of the month
Styles and styles I flip, Lil Dap remain sick
Yes, the Group Home is thick, so all you punks hear this
Every time you riff, the more fame that we get
Motherfuckers act hard, thinkin' that they are God
Niggas just don't understand, let me be my own man
Did everything on my own 'cause every place wasn't home
Anywhere that I rest, had to dress with a vest
I guess you get the routine, but with a lot of stress
Frustration on my mind, brothers doin' their time
Rhymes are organized like crime as you're ripped in a line
Brothers just don't know how shit got to go
'Cause I was told to never give my back to the street
As I walk through the ghetto, dead souls I greet
See my man, give him pound, then I walk with a frown
Another minute, another brother's gunned down
Shit is gettin' too close, that's why the Group Home is thick
So every time you riff, the more fame that we get
My father always said don't watch the one 'cross the street
Watch the one right next because he's easy to flex
To keep to what he said, yeah, that deep-ass nigga

Drugstore worth more, dope rhyme vendor
Not partial to beef, the chief ambassador
Niggas get mad 'cause they can't score
Like a Wild West flick, they wish to shoot up my door
But I incite a riot, don't even try it
Bust up chumps so crab kids, keep quiet
Like I said before, I tap jaws, snatch whores
Kill suckers in wars, vic a style you said was yours
Money grip, wanna flip, but you're fish
House the mic like your hooker and did tricks on the bitch
Dirty Rotten Scoundrel and my name is Jeru
Utilizin' my tools in '92

We rock knots and got props like Norm Peterson

While they devise our demise, we grow wise
Upset the set up, the element of surprise
Itz a set up
It's time to upset the set up
Though they conspire, fake us to make us retire
With the burning desire, we make it out of the crossfire
Thoughts are higher, elevating and focused
While the path is narrow, for those like us
Primo beats provoke us to meditate like Zen
With the will and the strength, of a million men
While they introspect, where nothing is met
It's been that way for a while, so much has come and then went
But I'm confident, a few, are due to redeem
Their respective kingdoms, with an abundance of cream
So if I were to scheme, it would be on a realer dream
Like formin' effective teams to filter the smokescreens
You totin' in jeans, don't even know the true envy
The man I'm pickin' apart, and plus they both were friends to me
Past trivial pursuits like East and West coast feuds
Come against me on the mic, many and most will lose
Like most dudes, I love this hip-hop, and this rap stuff
But I don't like the shows, where the ignorant act up
While some'll be rippin' it, they be in the crowd wildin'
Flippin' on kids, for the chains and medallions
Or the kid, they don't like, from a beef from way back
And decide that's the night, perfect time for payback
It's wack for the group, plus the others who came
To see a fat ass show, instead there's bullets aflame
While they devise our demise, we grow wise
Upset the set up, the element of surprise

Still waters run deep, this is leagues in depth
Quiet as kept they slept we crept
Society puts the squeeze on MC's like iron grips of death
From here on in peace and blessings long cherish your breath
Gifted and Rhyme, you now how we do, stay true
Follow through lay down the law, 'cause it's probable and overdue
All systems overdue, my guns know me
I only hold a few my nigga for only a few hold me
Never forget the ones before me, my momma told me
Sacrifice for the ones behind me leadin' the seeds
Blind leads, black on black, crime to me
Inclined to refine my creed, I eat thinkin' lead
Conceive to make the beast bleed, enhance thoughts
Like tossed trees 'cross the Earth three-fourths
Let my offspring feed all three, corpus delectis cost me
Lost and found on enemy ground, quoted although
They don't know how we get down at sound speed we breed
No more confined to blind greed and self destructive deeds
Heed my freedom war cry, of course I'm N.Y.
Hug my peeps that died, the loved ones alive
Reinforce and fly high as I lie so shall I
From New I to Cali, next plateau U.N.I.versal
Unleash the black rain
Show 'em who in control, electro-magnetic
Pull on the hole, ill as toters bang out

Make some power moves and tighten up my bankroll
Chumps are leary though, they see me as a threat
I'm like the black dutch schultz when you get me upset
Five-oh makes me wanna flip, larry davis style
Got a nigga depressed, while he's awaiting trial
It's ok though, cause from grey skies comes blue
Through darkness comes light and I be known as the guru
And this I certify we all should be alerted by
The traps within the system, our youth is getting murdered by
The DA says they got me on a felony
I'm tryin to live my life, so what the fuck is you tellin me?
The streets are war, that's what brothers carry weapons for
And I take the weight as I did before
The next thing you know, they got me on the radio

Peace to my man hass, and orange man paying the cost
All the twenty-five to lifers all my brothers getting tossed
Into the system, supposed to rehabilitate
It's why you gotta regulate your own mindstate
Read, study lessons and build your inner power
The next level, doesn't tolerate cowards
For example, I know this rich nigerian
Powerful american that's proud to be an african
He asked me why do all us brothers be gettin trapped
I told him I'd explain it broke it down in a rap
Whether you got naps, braids waves or no hair
Without esteem for yourself nigga, you going nowhere
And you can swagger like you rule this josey wales
Unorganized revolt almost always mostly fails
Give up the savage ways, be effective soldiers
To elevate the mental is to be poor no more
There's war in the streets, prepared men know best
Our rhyme as live as it gets, JFK to LAX
They're always makin trouble yo, against the righteous
Killing us in cold blood, those beats those vipers
And as I sit feelin the pain in my wrist
I vow to myself that i'ma change this shit
Or at least I gotta try, or part of me will die
And only by action will any ideas solidify
So I inhale, exhale as I ponder
This grown man will make mistakes no longer
I've been there, I've seen how they make us fall victim
To their tricknowledgy, with no apology I diss em
And so I rip facts to dope tracks I caress

And at the sight of a four-fifth, I guess you just might
Wanna do a dance or two
'Cause they could maybe bust you for self or with a crew
No matter if you or your brother's a star
He could pop you and jet without a getaway car
And some might say that he's a dummy
But he's sticking you and taking all of your money
It's a daily operation
He might be loose in the park or lurking at the train station
Mad brothers know his name
So he thinks he got a little fame from the stick-up game
And while we're blaming society
He's at a party with his man
They got their eye on the gold chain that the next man's wearing
It looks big but they ain't staring
Just thinking of a way and when to get the brother
They'll be long gone before the kid recovers
And back around the way, he'll have the chain on his neck
Claiming respect, just to get a rep

The one with the hoodie said, ""We'll hurt you""
If you don't run all your jewels and pay
Give up the Rolex watch or you won't see another day
See they were on the attack
And one said, ""Yo, you wanna make this to a homicide rap?
Make it fast so we can be on our way
Kick in the rings and everything, okay?""
The kid was nervous and flinching
And little shorty with the .38, yo, he was inching
Closer and closer, put the gun to his head
Shorty was down to catch a body instead
Money was scared so he panicked
Took off his link and his rings, and ran frantic
But shorty said, ""Nah"" pulled the trigger and stepped
It was nothing, he did it just to get a rep
Stick up kids is out to tax

The rep grows bigger, now he's known for his trigger finger
Rolling with troops of his sons like a gangster figure
He's near the peak of his crazy career
His posse's a nightmare, macking jewels and crazy gear
But as we know, the things we do come back
And Shorty's not peeping, others are scheming to counteract
'Cause the kid that got shot didn't perish, so
He pulls up in a jeep with tinted windows
Too late, Shorty was caught in the midst
His time ran out, his number came up, and that's it

Stirring up controversy, making us fight each other

When I cock back these lyrics, y'all punks best be ghost
I be the seven twenty-one, eighteen twenty-one
The illest one, I'm almost doper than anyone
Straight out the late nights of Bed-Stuy
Stepping up, y'all put your weapons up, I make heads fly
You're artificial like saccharin
You're crazy fake, it's more than skills you be lacking in
Concepts you bite, 'cause your identity ain't tight
Trying to be something you're not, like pulling a knife at a gunfight
I'm trooping on night air like flight number 106
And getting all up in your fucking mix
You got me upset, and I got you uptight
'Cause my committee's in your city tonight, a'ight?
We got 17 million of us plus, two million Indians
That makes 19 mil', lighting shit up like Wild Bill
I be the supreme father plus the ill kid with drama
My karma creates the Teflon to pierce your body armor
And make sure you check the shit before you walk to me, or talk to me
Stepping to me improperly, you just may catch the weaponry
My specialty is tearing tracks out the frame

Tremendous trooper, verbal nigga with the fitness
Drop you for your spot with the blazer, then I blast you
Slice precise like Benihana's when I come to bring the dramas
Styles so swift, that you can't peep the god
As your lyrics get buried, six feet deep in my backyard
I laugh hard, while your mental I run through mazes
Dark stages of terror to shatter your dressing room mirror
Your whole era gets crushed, your whole show gets bum rushed
Too many dumb punks, want to enter this rap scene
Kicking Willie Bobo, but need to be slapped clean
Into oblivion, the true champion always rises
I bring surprises to the chief plus their advisers
Size me up, and you will find nothing's larger
Catch more wreck on your dome, than a deranged fucking barber
So what you made some dough, you best keep on scrambling
All your vanity, is instantly crushed, when I start handling
Demanding that you pay for your weak rhyme display
Coast to coast, I break the fakes everyday
Make them pay
Make them pay
MCs, beware, some enemies freeze
Make them pay
MCs beware, some enemies freeze
I see myself like the black rap messiah
Colossal spreading my gospel through electrical wires
Spit fire through speech, so I can reach each and every
Tom, dick and jerry slippin' like petroleum jelly
Too busy in the limelight, can't rhyme tight
I got divine right to bring y'all to light
Something ain't right, to be an MC, you gotta thug
Or to thug, you gotta be an MC, this shit is bugged
Show love to few; deal with crew and crew only
And think universal like Sony
Phony pounds and fake hugs is usually avoided
Give a fuck like Pizza Hut, I got to stay noid-ed
Cause that same nigga you trust, could be that same cat
Behind that gat that bust, quiet ya, with the silencer
Keep it hush, ashes to dust, then dust to ashes
Nowadays, it's who pull out the fastest, imagine this
Rap shit without this gat shit, or the phony cat
In black talking 'bout how much his MAC spit
But this year, Gang Starr got changes being made
No wack shit being played, no fake macks getting paid
No Versace MCs, with a mouth full of Mo'
Soundin' like a ho spittin' at a fashion show flow
I bombshell that pastel Chanel rap through a maxwell
Ever since young Krumb, was taught to rap well
Going deep, process of thought, when my eyes closes
Awaken with turban, robe and sandals like Moses
Travelling high sands and eastern lands for the answers
Ignorance is spreading through the streets like it was cancer
Too many drinking not thinking, when behind that trigger
A 38 escalate the murder rate, for us niggas

They say it's lonely at the top in whatever you do
You always gotta watch motherfuckers around you
Nobody's invincible, no plan is foolproof
We all must meet our moment of truth
The same sheisty cats that you hang with and do your thang with
Could set you up and wet you up nigga, peep the language
It's universal, you play with fire, it may hurt you
Or burn you, lessons are blessings you should learn through
Let's face facts, although emcees lace tracks
It doesn't mean behind the scenes there ain't no dirt to trace back
That goes for all of us, there ain't nobody to trust
It's like sabotage, it's got me ready to bust
But I can't jeopardize what I have done up to this point
So I'ma get more guys to help me run the whole joint
Cultivate, multiply, motivate or else we'll die
You know I be the master of the who, what, where and why
See when you're shinin', some chumps'll wanna dull ya
Always selfish jealous punks will wanna pull ya
Down, just like some shellfish in a bucket
'Cause they love it to see your ass squirm like a worm
But just as you'll receive what is comin' to you
Everybody else is gonna get theirs too
I ain't no saint, therefore I cannot dispute
That everyone must meet their moment of truth
Actions have reactions, don't be quick to judge
You may not know the hardships people don't speak of
It's best to step back, and observe with couth
For we all must meet our moment of truth
Sometimes you gotta dig deep when problems come near
Don't fear, things get severe for everybody everywhere
Why do bad things happen to good people?
Seems that life is just a constant war between good and evil
The situation that I'm facin' is mad amazin'
To think such problems can arise from minor confrontations
Now I'm contemplatin' in my bedroom pacin'
Dark clouds over my head, my heart's racin'
Suicide? Nah, I'm not a foolish guy
Don't even feel like drinkin' or even gettin' high
'Cause all that's gonna do really is accelerate
The anxieties that I wish I could alleviate
But wait, I've been through a whole lot of other shit before
So I oughta be able to withstand some more
But I'm sweatin' though, my eyes are turnin' red and yo
I'm ready to lose my mind, but instead I use my mind
I put down the knife and take the bullets out my nine
My only crime was that I'm too damn kind
And now some scandalous motherfuckers wanna take what's mine
But they can't take the respect that I've earned in my lifetime
And you know they'll never stop the furious force of my rhymes
So like they say, every dog has its day
And like they say, God works in a mysterious way
So I pray, rememberin' the days of my youth
As I prepare to meet my moment of truth
""You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free!""
Yo, I got one lyric pointed at your head for start
Another one is pointed at your weak-ass heart
Now if I pull the trigger on these fully-loaded lines
You're gonna wish I would've pulled a black nine
I mack dimes, crack the spines of the fake gangsters
Yeah the bitin' triflin' niggas and the studio pranksters
Yo, lookin' at the situation plainly, will you remain, G?
Or will you be looked upon strangely?
I reign as the articulator with the greater data
Revolvin' on the TASCAM much doper than my last jam
While others struggle to juggle tricky metaphors
I explore more to expose the core
A lot of emcees act stupid to me
And we have yet to see if they can match our longevity
But anyway, it's just another day
Another fake jack I slay with my spectac' rap display
Style's smooth but rugged, you can't push or shove it
You dig it and you dug it 'cause like money you love it
The king of monotone, with my own throne
Righteously violent prone, my words bring winds like cyclones
Stormin' your hideout, blockin' out your sunlight
Your image and your business were truly not done right
Throw up your He Allah Now Divine Saviours
You got no hand skills, there's no security to save ya
No pager, no celly, no drop top Benz-y
I came to bring your phony hip-hop to an ending
My art of war will leave you sore from the abuse

Then up steps another, he gets smothered
That's word to mother, or should I say moms
I drop bombs, scorchin niggaz like napalm
Sucka, boy, get off my shit
Get off my dick so what I make butter hits

So when you think you know the whole you don't even know the half
You're not a threat to myself, and neither to my staff
Not the type to really dance too much, although I used to
Rather bust a fresh line, and get loose to
The blunted ill types of beats premier makes
Makes your girl's rear shake, let me set it straight
Refrain
Some rappers use hooks to this shit
But if you took that shit out
And you took all the music out
What would remain? the voice no doubt
Bless my soul I control
When in pimp mode
My bank roll expands
I invest in my man
I plan, to keep rap real
So if your shit ain't fat then kneel
You squeal, feeling pain from my oral flex
What about oral sex, which chick's next
To open wide and get a chunk from a real brother
Yeah, some real funk from a real brother
They get sprung and most of them don't recover
But I don't diss em I just talk to em
Cause the sound, of my voice, it does a lot to em
So you and, the niggaz right there
Be aware, like swv, I'm right here
Waitin to correct your ass
And if you don't follow now I'll disrespect your ass
More vicious than sid, do a crime with no bid
I tell a bitch that I didn't when you know that I did
Take a trip to a land a-far
Then come back, and people still know gangstarr
See I'm the ladies choice
Cause I got crazy styles, still

Yo, what's up, son?
Yo, man, you-know-what-I-mean? I need this money, man
Get up out in these, in these streets, man
Yo, so what's the deal, god?
I'm saying, what you need, though?
Yo, let me have like, two or three, three Gs, man
I'm saying, I'm saying, son, man
You know what happened last time, though
I gotta do what I gotta do, man, I gotta eat, man
What's up, man? Oh, your baby momma stressing you?
Way past the days of the deuce me and you stays a crew
Only a few percent knew what me and you went through
We've been sent to dominate, these corny come-lates
And set this crooked rap shit straight from Crenshaw to Castle Gate
Like Pete and CL, I reminisce over days
From the streets of Boston to New York and all the ways
For certain niggas to blow up, and crime paid
But my praise goes to the most high
'Cause some nights I got so wild yo, I almost died
Some stuff I got into, really scarred my mental
Pops wasn't trying to hear it, 'cause of what he been through
Still, like my nigga Havoc said, sometimes you gotta
Hit your crew off, so they can make some bread
'Cause no matter the weather, niggas be needing cheddar
And things in this world are more fucked up than ever
So let's make this bond to keep this hip-hop strong
You a man baby pop, you know right from wrong
So stay out of trouble, and that goes for me too
That's what we need to do, that's my advice to you
You remember what happened last time, when you got knocked
Doing your thing, sewing shit up on the block
You need to stop, fore you get caught again
Or you get shot and I lose another friend
(Any man with the plan is precise with his life)
(Think twice)
My advice to you, cut down on champagne and booze
For a nigga like me, most time that shit's bad news
It's like lighting a fuse, whether it's sneakers or shoes
'Cause somebody always wanna step up to start a feud
It's like set-tin it off but not the movie
Plus let's get some real women, forget floozies and the groupies
'Cause they spell mad problems from watts to Harlem
And the bullshit won't stop, long as the world's revolving
And I recall when niggas knew my pops had clout
But they didn't know my sorry ass was getting kicked out
And they was seeing if I wanted to come bubble with them
And make my ends triple and double with them
And get in trouble with them, now memories of them
I wear 'em in my heart like a emblem
I doubt we'd ever be big-time selling dope coke or dust
It's killing us, let's take our people and make a exodus
Annihilation, inhalation through the lungs
Or extermination, by the use of dirty guns
Triple beam dreams and drug schemes of mad cream
Could be a sad scene when you go to that extreme

Motherfuckers always wanna know what makes me tick

You thought that I would slip 'cause you seen me drinkin' 40's
It shocked you, then you told your friends you saw me
Well, say what you want 'cause all of mine is intact
In fact, I'll have you open like a hooker's gap
I like to catch a buzz 'cause I get into the beats more

A lot of MC's fake hard just to gain appeal
I like some gangster rap, don't like the prankster crap
So I get past all that by kickin' straight up facts
There ain't no reason to shoot unless you got beef
If you pull out and you don't use it then you may catch grief
Toolies and TECs ain't toys but kids got 'em today
If they're ready to spray, best get the fuck out the way
I try keepin' my sanity by thinkin' of better times
If I write clever rhymes then maybe I'll climb
But what the hell's success if the mess ain't changin'?
5-0'S still corrupt, stupid gangs still bangin'
Stick-up kids still stickin', nasty hookers still trickin'
All the pimps still pimpin' and all the crackheads trippin'
While the dealers still sellin' so I'll refrain from the yellin'
And the preachin', 'cause who the fuck would I reach?
Man, niggas don't wanna starve that, they wanna live fat
Who'd wanna clean up their act when the papes come in stacks?
They live for the minute and they're all wrapped up in it
It's an unfortunate state, for many it's too late
Now death stalks the streets and it's right at your gate

Life's a bitch, so who are we to judge each other?
I know I got faults, I ain't the only motherfucker
Stuff I heard about you wasn't too cool, you know
Like how you smoke woolies and that your girl's a ho
But I don't listen to shit unless the story's legit
And knuckleheads need to quit 'cause they be ridin' the dilsnick
But I'm takin' care of business regardless
And when it comes to rhymin', you know I'm hittin' hardest
So you can kick dirt but in the end you'll feel pain

I'll be leading from beginning to end

It's the fact—listen, when I was a little nigga growing up
When I met this nigga, him and Guru, right? (Mmm-hmm)
It probably—what was that, '87, '88? ('88)
'88, I was 16, 17 years old
I was gettin' money in Baltimore, I'm from the Bronx (Okay)
So, I respected niggas from outta town coming to another town tryin' to get money (A'ight)
Feel me? So that's what clicked me with Gang Starr
I thought Guru, God bless him, was my little man
That nigga was ten years older than me
I'm from outside (Okay)
And I thought that, you know
I come from the era where rappers wasn't really, uh, admired the way they are now
You feel me? (Right) Them niggas was entertainers to us (Mmm-hmm)
We was fuckin' with niggas who threw stones at the penitentiary (Right)
Alright, so, when I got with Gang Starr, it was like
""Yo, I like these niggas, they from outta town, they came here to get money
And they doing they thing, I fuck with them""

I'm waitin up the ave to see if anyone folds

I knew the difference between gimmicky gangsters and powerful people
I'm the reason, why the game is flipped
I'm the reason, why your aim is missed
I'm the reason why you're mad I only sprained my wrist

Believe me it ain't easy like you sleazy niggaz think
Uneasy niggaz blink, when I step to the stage
And don't flinch, don't move a inch, I'm bout to empty the gauge

Always dreamed about what I would do, if I had shit
Drop jewels infinite for the blind deaf and dumb
Down with M.O.P. and Bumpy plus I just left Krumb

And I'm gettin at you cats
Aiyyo popped out the beast, met The Ownerz with the lease
Soldifyin contracts over dope beats
Learned a whole lot up in these streets
Like when to talk, when to spark, and when not to speak
I do the one before a gun come out
Plus y'all don't really wanna see Krumb dumb out
A ghetto doctrine to watch every pistol pop
And then while you watchin examine all options
Young bodies in the coffin more often
It stay the same from Brooklyn to Boston
Every interstate, more youth with the inner hate
Deep in the struggle, puttin food on they dinner plate
Hungry W.O.L.V.E.S. that roll thick in packs

Works with me, giving herself, by my side

(Verse One: Guru)
The names have been changed to protect the innocent
Each step is intricate, I rep magnificent
Knew this kid named Ronnie, used to make cash with Caesar
They made a lot of money back in the 80's crack fever
Caesar was an overachiever, a kingpin and 18-and-a-half
He got knocked and left Ronnie to watch the team and the stash
Plus his crib, his jewels, his whip and his girl
And Ronnie's self-interests had him livin in a different world
He rocked Caesar's chains, he put Caesar's rings
Smokin mad wools all day, with Caesar's change
Not to mention he pushed up on Caesar's wifey
A move like that my man, extremely sheisty
It all got back to Caesar in the bing
They found Ronnie's body in the playground by the swings
Anyone can get it, for sure it don't matter dawg

Dissension can occur from within one's ranks
The chain can be weakened, by just one link
Pricks be galavantin from one crew to the next
Musical click-ass niggaz catch two to the chest
My usual guess is that they chose to digress
Disillusioned by greed, causin you to distress
Just do what's best, clean house, leave out
Them punks can't touch what they can't peep out
See I'm a raw nigga, and like my pops I'm a lawgiver
Can't throw a wrench in my game, I'm a boss figure
Take you under my wing, it don't matter God
Dead you if you try to commit, sabotage
Rise for me now, kneel for me now
Time to pass judgment, can't feel for you now
Lay in your bed, accept your fate
Try to clean it up, except you're late

So many rappers tryin' to get their name out
Many got caught up for just havin' their chain out
So many rappers couldn't handle showbiz
While I'm steady rockin', so you know what it is
So many rappers made this their dream
Then quickly, most have disappeared from the scene
So many one-hit wonders, it's like a spin of the wheel
You know I stay consistent and get it in for real
So many rappers wanna rock like this
But they got no stamina and they don't talk like this
Plus I've learned to avoid the traps
I truly love this shit, that's word to MTV Raps
They'll get their little run and have a little fun
Some'll go for popularity, to a little, then to none
Some'll get jacked 'cause they floss too much
Others'll leave the game 'cause they lost too much
Some got bodied before they were totally on
It's like when keepin' it real goes totally wrong
Some get beat by managers, and shiesty execs
Others are brainwashed by their unlikely success
Well, I have proven time and time again
That I'm built to last, so watch me shine again

Then quickly, most have disappeared from the scene
Many had major deals, big money and all that
On 106 & Park, in magazines and all that
So many had all that, so how did they fall flat?
That's why my motto has always been to just fall back
And watch the whole circus go by, I'm that guy
As soon as I appear on the scene, nigga, it's shy
So many pranksters with so many gimmicks
Wonder where they're at now, probably somewhere lookin' timid
It's all madness, there's too many to count
Everybody and their mom wanna rap, no doubt
Many come out with a bang, and their own new slang
Then end up back in the hood without a goddamn thing
Some make noise, they hit the top of the charts
Still, the shit that I kick will be stoppin' they hearts

Soliloquy Of Chaos,Daily Operation,https://open.spotify.com/album/74DwNAuirHLDLVLrBQAnVg,1992,2768931,"Five carloads deep, time to go do a show
Got a massive crew and we're ready to roll
So I grab my gear hop in the whip and ride
Premier he's got the fly dope system inside
But my shit cranks too and we've got mad tapes
Of all the underground groups with the lyrics and bass
Off into the new york night we go
Dre Large got the camera, Biggest Gord's got three rolls of film
So we can take the macked out photos
Tommy Hill, The Damaja and my man Guzmo
Corey and Smurf and Lil Dap's got a forty
My man Gary and Shiz and the Nutcracker shorty
Mike Rhone, chillin' like Capone
Robinhood, known as Mel with the clientele
Mo, JT, Mega, can't forget Black
Big Rob and Sincere, yes the posse's fat
Outloud pulls up plus there's Sid and OC
Big Mel from Strong I and H.L. the one and only
O Delicious, Eli, Bazz and Eon
And the aroma of the blunts has me thinking beyond
And to the rest of the crew you know the bond is strong
And you know who's who, so let me not prolong
For this was a night to remember
I had on the beige Tims with the two tone leather
So we get to the jam, the gig, the venue
Then we circled around and then drove into
The front the place was packed the line was long
I was bobbing my head 'cause the music was on
I turned it down then I peeped to my right
I saw this kid and his girl having a fight
Another kid walked up and mushed the kid in his face
And then the kid pulled out and bust and laid him to waist
A riot broke out girls screaming and scheming crews
Started buck wilding trying to snatch kids jewels
After that Five-O came and turned the party out
And then an ambulance came to take the body out
And we didn't even get all the equipment out
And we didn't even get to turn the place out
This can happen often and it's really fucked up
So I'll ask you to your face, homeboy what's up?
Did you come to see my show or the stupid nigger playoffs?
Killing you and killing me, it's the soliloquy of chaos
Chaos
And if you live in the cities where streets reek warfare
People getting nowhere bot you go for yours there
You'll find it doesn't pay to front or play the role
You could get stole or maybe beat with a pole
Then you'll wanna retaliate, regroup and come back
So you set the brothers up for a sneak attack
Whether you die or kill them, it's another brother dead
But I know you'll never get that through your head
'Cause we're mislead and misfed facts, we're way off
Killing you and killing me, it's the soliloquy of chaos

To make it out the trap in your mind it's a hard climb
But even if your change come right and exact
There's another brother schemin' so just watch your back
I know a brother who thought he had it all
But little did he know he was bound for a downfall
He'd pick up the heater and go stick somebody
He wouldn't give a damn if he killed somebody
'Cause if somebody would get in the way of him gettin' loot
There'd be no hesitation, he'd just shoot
It's like the good, the bad and the ugly
Except it's reality and you don't see it on TV
Brothers keep dyin' in the streets 'cause the streets are designed
To keep you from havin' peace of mind
I know an old man, he's got a rifle to stifle any young punk
He hides it under his bunk
And I know a kid who's been to jail and
He told me that the system had failed him
So now he's out the joint and he's like flippin' on kids
And the people in his neighborhood are flippin' their wigs
But you gotta check the move 'cause there's a reason
A method to the madness and you know what I'm meanin'
'Cause rather than bein' the herb, the, a chump
You can be just like my man called holdin' a pump
But livin' like that you take a chance with your life
But some things in life sometimes will make you uptight
I'm like an avalanche of knowledge poundin' down all fools
All fakes, all snakes and ones who try to break the rules
And regulations, stipulations made by the gangster
You try to flex muscle, you know you can't hang hops
You're makin' me vexed but yeah, you can go next
Just remember, the illest brother claims respect
♪
Got to be the illest brother to claim respect
It takes the illest brother, just to get respect
Got to be the illest brother when it's time to get wreck
You got to be the illest brother when I get my mic check
Yo money, don't front, you know you blew your chance
And now it's my turn so I'ma take command
'Cause I'm like the one who's got all the juice
I always get loose, I got the balls to reduce your crew
Very easily I got more ammo
I'm like the ill kid, psycho manual
'Cause now I'm past the point and I ain't gonna return
And when it comes to your destruction I ain't really concerned
About the consequences 'cause I'm livin' day to day
So who are you to comment about me and my ways?
I get my attitude from livin' and I'll never forget
You got to be the illest brother just to claim respect
The worst thing about jail is women come and visit you, man
And they get funky when a nigga's locked up
Right, you be eight inches of glass
You can't reach them motherfuckers
Right, she be talkin' about, ""I never did like your mama""

The militia, certain individuals of unidentified nature
Is now under complete control
Hip hop is not, what it is today
It's the real, it's the militia
If heads only knew how I felt about the rap game
They'd relocate, and change their fuckin' name
I eradicate move fakers, roll with coat shakers
Give dap to mad money makers
Shared cells with lifetakers, have sex with rump shakers
I make moves so I'm a earthquaker
I've been known to instill fear
Although the world may be round, we still trapped in the square
City light, got me buggin' and trife
Some die by the gun, some die by the knife
It's alright, like a game of spades I'm trump tight
Premier hit me with music to ensure that it thump right
And my flight, will be taken solely at night
'Cause that's when the freaks come out, no doubt
And in the dark hours is when I will shower
With the knowledge of my trade to get paid
Still I make moves like a snake in the grass, roundabout
I'll be dickin' it down while you be assed out
Puff mad l's but never passed out
And if I'm caught up in a jam, I blast my way out
There'll be no lettin' up, just straight shuttin' up
Or we'll start the wettin' up
Lyrical infrared scepter never miss you
Big Shug, guru, Freddie Fox, the militia, militia
Everybody's spittin it, the rhyme is hot
'Cause it's big Shug, guru, and Freddie the Fox
When premier bring the beats, no it just don't stop
It's the militia, militia, militia
Everybody's spittin it, the rhyme is hot
'Cause it's big Shug, guru, and Freddie the Fox
When premier bring the beats, no it just don't stop
It's the militia, militia, militia
Yo, I ain't one to succumb to no man, but to command
And scoop up the troops when it's time to take a stand
Emphatically, deep strategies leave casualties
I creep gradually, 'til everybody knows
That I got more flows than rosebud got hoes
The anger inside had me trapped
'Til I got geared up with raps to tear you up like big gats
For big stacks, watch your back when I send 'em in
Caught you tremblin', my name and face you're rememberin'
Several attempts, but nah bitch, you'll never win
Rhymes pierce your skin or maybe limbs we'll be severin'
Take you to the mat, peep that, you should keep back
My ill-kid format will lay you flat like a doormat
That I walk on, I meditate while you talk on
And gossip, so I drop my hot shit, fully loaded glock clips
So get the fuck out my block, kid
As nights turn to days, days go back to nights, we be speaking it right
And keeping it tight up in the street life
I meet life, head on, no holds barred
Born with a heart of gold, now mostly cold and scarred
On guard, choose your weapon, or get to steppin'
Lyrical bullets make you dance from the trance you be kept in
Assessments are made before and during combat
I master my hunger, blow the spot when I bomb cats
One of us, equals many of us
Disrespect one of us, you'll see plenty of us
Conflict, is what I predict
You and your fellas is mad jealous, attempting to flare
We cleverly stalked ya, your fam 'll miss ya

For you dope fiend niggaz in rap, I'm here to inject, check
My style is water baby, spread it around
But when you niggaz don't flow it right and fuck up my sound
I get down; in '89, I spit the buck in the face
Of every MC that came in the place, a scar you'll never erase
MC's are only recognized for their flows
I'm worldwide for the bitches, that I turned into hoes
You heard me spit it on jew-elz, that's how it goes

You can try to come at me, but do you want the kick back?
You snap inside the cage of a pit, and you get bit back
My war is so tight, my drama so ill
Beef with me hangs around like the unpaid bill
I push these lyrics through any MC, and make it burn
So the niggaz who be rhyming next, will miss a turn
When you speak of who's the dopest MC, I don't come up
But when you speak of who's the livest mc, I stay what up, what's up?
I got stripes while you got strikes and bogus mikes
Do what bitch niggaz do best bite

Long Island and Jersey get as fly as they want

Fort Green, bedstuy, Flatbush, Brownsville
Crown Heights and East New York will be down till
Medina takes respect for the style's we bring
Cuz in Brooklyn, we be into our own thing
Alantic terminals, redhook bushwick
Come to Brooklyn frontin, and you'll get mushed quick
We ain't just know for flipping and turning out parties
But also for the take no bullshit hotties
On the subject of blackness, well let me share this
Brooklyn is the home for cultural awareness
So in all fairness, you can never compare this
Some good, some bad. little hope for the weak
Dangerous streets and Coney Island Beach
All this included when you go for a tour
Some can get scandolous and outright raw
When you step, step correct and watch where you move
We pay dues so we ain't trying to lose
Here in Brooklyn
The home of the black and the beautiful
For a ruffrap sound, ain't a place more suitable
Other cities claim this, and others claim that
But let me give some props to the place where we be at

I've been incorporated with select personel
Right here in Brooklyn, the place where we dwell

All the east coast cities are fly to me
Peace to everybody down south and out west
But for me, Brooklyn, New York is the best
Don't be afraid to venture over the bridge
Although you may run in to some wild ass kids
Take the j train, the d or the a if you dare
And the 2, 3, 4, 5 also comes here

Packed my bags, to leave for good, it was a monday
Kissed my mother, gave my pops a pound
Then he hugged me, and then he turned around
I threw the duffelbag over my shoulder
It was time to get props kid, cause now I'm older
Time to fend for myself jack
So i'ma go for mine, and maybe never come back
Stopped at the lye spot before I hit the train station
Needed some boom for the mental relaxation
It took the last of my loot to make this move troop
But I ain't even tryin to work in a suit
Plus my aunt's got a room that's for rent
As long as there's no hoes and I don't come home bent
So f**k the bullshit I'm audi
I'm on a mission, cause if I stay I'll go crazy
I'm gonna make it God damnit
Out in b-r-double-o-k-lyn, the planet

Out in b-r-o-o-k-lyn, the planet
Crash boom bang I used to hang at four corners
And all the spots in beantown where niggaz carry burners
But I was more turned on by the micraphone
So one cold morning, I left home
Next I'm smokin blunts on?
Or workin in a mail room uptown, feelin sick and
Tired, of payin all these f**ked up dues
I wasn't tryin to lose -- I refused
Had a chick uptown, one in queens and one in jersey
Sometimes all you need to get by, is a girlie
But yo I still wasn't happy
I seen a lot of ill shit on my block, happen nightly
East new york is no joke kid
And peace to my man hass doin his bad
I went to flatbush to buy incense and weed
Stopped at the bookstands for somethin to read
That shit was rough cause my pockets was bare
And like the sayin goes, sometimes life ain't fair
But in my heart there ain't no quittin
So I stayed up late, to write some rhymes to some rhythms
Seconds away from just flippin
But f**kit I'll maintain, one day I'll be hittin
See i'ma make it God damnit
Out in b-r-double-o-k-lyn, the planet
I'll never fake it just slam it
There in b-r-o-o-k-lyn, the planet

Cause little shorty's scheamin on your rings and fronts
But don't sweat it, cause that's the life out here
A lot of niggaz, be livin real trife out here
I got my own place in bed-stuy
Known to many others, as do or die
Malcolm x boulevard and gates avenue
Smokin up the fat trey bags with the crew
Me and the niggaz troy and squeaky
Used to twist dutch masters, we got nice weekly
I used to build with the brothers by the spot
They had to hustle but they still knew a lot
To get my haircut had to go to fort greene
On myrtle ave, to get a fade with the sides clean
Then to fulton just to look around
Just to roam around, and find a chick to go uptown
And check a movie or some shit like that
I couldn't spend much but yo my game was fat
I remember this one chick, she brought me a beeper
Then one week later, she got me some sneakers
But then I stepped, cause I found out about her rep
And I ain't goin out bein no bitch's pet
But anyway I used to lay up in the crib
Listening to red and marley, wishin I was on kid
Saved my dough, stayed on the down low
Lounged and drank 40's with tommy, hill and gunsmoke
And lil' dap used to come by strapped
Nice off a l cause we stayed like that
Sometimes I used to miss my moms
Gunshots in the twilight, people fightin every night
But i'ma be aight still
Cause i'ma keep writin shit and perfectin my skills

It's the message in the song that makes you rock on
Some people go to places where they don't belong
Whether wrong or right, a lot of people fight
But I'm here to bless this mic, aight?
Verse one: guru
I take action the minute that the crowd gets hype
I'm type crashin, down like a meteorite
I'm bogart-ing, mics and whole stages
Destroying mc's dreams, from words to whole pages
Their rapbooks, look more like scrapbooks
With their fictional fairytales and frail ass hooks
A lot of shit has happened, since I started rappin
There's been enough beef, and enough gat clappin
There's been mad signs, for this brother to heed
And while some choose greed, I choose to plant seeds
For your mental, spirit and physical temple
Bob your head to it, there's the water you've been lead to it
Bathe in it, a long time you've been cravin it
Prance to it, use your third eye and glance through it
Your state of being, becoming advanced through it
While others rhyme with no reason I be breezin
Their mics I seize them, then I try em for treason
I used to always like to hang out
Now I lounge in the rest writin bombs while tracks bang out
I know you peeped me in the club then
But now I'm in your speaker, with the voice that you're lovin

And peace to my nigga premier, with the golden touch

As in the jihad, most humble, most merciful
That's because I be god, I trog through fogs, puffing logs

Scarred and barred, and then, banished from my f**kin kingdom

Exquisite exotic exciting type shit
Enough to make the real heads wake up and get hype quick

Kick rhymes without rehearsal, I cross the burnin sands
Now I stand here with virtue, of course I could hurt you
Simply with my point of view, and I knew
That many would come, that's why I've chosen
To cut off pathways, and there's no runways or doorways open
For the jokers who ain't focused
And all the fake mercenaries get buried by the tongue of terrifying fury
Nothing's blurry, f**k it I got no worries
Hearts and minds, shine bright light with insight
Yeah sense my birthright to set up cyphers with power

Girls say that I'm fly 'cause they be likin' my clothes

When I apply my vicious grip, you can't take it, man
Face it and understand, there are no winnings for you
What I'm beginnin' to do, is bring an endin' to you and your crew
I sip a brew and at the same time drink the life out of you

G-O-D, can sell a half a line for a G
Check ballistics, you won't be takin' mine from me

Not Thor but frightening, type of stress I've been under

I'ma shoot four through your fedora, destroy your medulla
I could get these niggas X'd, quick as sendin' a text
For disrespect, shit'll be simple as orderin' an Uber
I don't know what's quicker to change, them figures or fame

Every time a nigga like Fever Nina come out the dealership
The streets hear the sound of that Preem droppin' the needle skip
Like Kane walkin' in ""The Symphony""
Abel is my brother who all he offers is infamy
I bust Magnums, either strategize or duck faster
I send his whole group home like Melachi the Nutcracker
Preem blowin' weed, he a master on the courts
I'm a student with the rap that's spewin' passion on the chorus
While the smoke is in the air, feel like voodoo's on the floor
'Cause we got the actual ashes of Guru on the boards
