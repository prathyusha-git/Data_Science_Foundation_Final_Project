All The Roses,Come To Life,https://open.spotify.com/album/72gxs3VqZZmAYhefqyuJaR,2009,111948,"What do I do with all the roses outside
There not supposed to grow this time of year
It's a hard rain but you got me smiling
And you are the only one who can get me through
I can hear your voice when you're whispering
I can feel your heart when it's beating
I believe you're near when the ghost comes in
I can hear you when you're calling out my name
I can remember when a day lasted forever
Summer was everything and there was nothing to fear
You were so tough but your heart said so much
And nobody else got through quite like you
I can hear your voice when you're whispering
I can feel your heart when it's beating
I believe you're near when the ghost comes in
I can hear you when you're calling out my name
Did I get hit by the moonlight, under the stars
'Cos you feel so close that I can reach you
Wherever you are
I can hear your voice when you're whispering
I can feel your heart when it's beating
I believe you're near when the ghost comes in
I can hear you when you're calling
I can hear your voice when you're whispering

And drowning from the need

Of one who does not care
To sipping cocktail sedatives
Two months to hide somewhere

you walk over

The wolf has caught the chicken
And now I feel unsteady
Emotions on the blink again
So kick me when you're ready
Here lies a violet coffin
The death of my control
Along with all my skeletons
They put them in the hole
VERSE
Sickened by the notion
I give myself again
Choking on the bullet, the gun-
thats found a friend
So raise your glass to sorrow
And drink to all the pain
Tie a silver ribbon around
The pieces that remain

You pulled me out of the past

But I'll be close behind
I'll follow you into the dark
No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white
Just our hands clasped so tight
Waiting for the hint of a spark
If Heaven and Hell decide
That they both are satisfied
Illuminate the No's on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you
When your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark
In Catholic school as vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
And I held my tongue as she told me,
""Son, fear is the heart of love.""
So I never went back
If Heaven and Hell decide
That they both are satisfied
Illuminate the No's on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you
When your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark
You and me have seen everything to see
From Bangkok to Calgary
And the soles of your shoes are all worn down
The time for sleep is now
It's nothing to cry about
'Cause we'll hold each other soon
In the blackest of rooms
If Heaven and Hell decide
That they both are satisfied
Illuminate the No's on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you

That's all we need because it's all we can take
One thing I never see the same when your 'round
I don't believe in him—his lips on the ground
I wanna take you to that place in the ""Roche""
But no one gives us any time anymore
He ask me once if I'd look in on his dog
You made an offer for it, then you ran off
I got this picture of us kids in my head
And all I hear is the last thing that you said
""I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine""
I didn't want to anymore, oh oh oh
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day

Now I thought about what I wanna say

So I chained myself to a friend
Some more again
It didn't matter what they wanted to see
He thought he saw someone that looked just like me
The summer memory that just never dies
We worked too long and hard to give it no time
He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
He runs his scissor at the seem in the wall
He cannot break it down or else he would fall
One thousand lonely stars hiding in the cold
Take it, I don't wanna sing anymore
""I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine""
I didn't want to anymore, oh oh oh
And we will never be alone again

I need some direction-'cause the clock is tickin' away
Then a friend of a friend of mine
Says I've really been on his mind
And wants to go out and check out what the feelin's about
Says we have a deep connection-well it sure is news to me
And all I can say is
Intuition tells me how to live my day
Intuition tells me when to walk away
Could have turned left
Could have turned right
But I ended up here
Bang in the middle of real life
Then another one always says-she'd do anything to get ahead
She doesn't care if she has to scratch and claw to get in the door
She wants her 15 minutes of fame and 20 would be nice
But I guess it's her life
'Cause intuition tells me that I'm doin' fine
Intuition tells me when to draw the line
Could have turned left
Could have turned right
But I ended up here
Bang in the middle of real life
should have turned left

Them pearly gates are never gonna open
Never gonna give a warm embrace
But at least I tried, and on the day that I die, my headstones gonna say...
God forgives, but not me
Too many sins, no apologies
Headed to hell on a highway
M.I.A, on a motherfucking Friday, such a nice day to fly away
Got the world in my palm as I drop straight
I can't believe, I'm still alive
I've seen some things, I've seen the light
Close to death, and god's a myth?
The greatest trick that the devil ever told was proving that he don't exist
And the older I get, the more that the fate consists
Of sitting up on this fence
Between pain and bliss, where the pain exists with the happiness I missed
My final wish, I'm really hoping that I get, cause my last two would conflict
So I'm rubbing this lamp till my hand gets cramped and the genie pops out of it
You think I act tough?
Because I've been cuffed?
