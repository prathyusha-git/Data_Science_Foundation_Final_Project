He opened up the door like, what are you here for
And I don't wanna hurt you so you should go
Cause the person I'm here with, you know
And I'm like, clearly you don't know me
Because I don't run away from collisions
Any easier than bad relationships or decisions
And why are we whispering in the hall?
Who's in there with you?
Why didn't you call?
He says, why didn't you call?
And I'm bawling now
Because I can't tell who he's protecting me
Or him, or her
And the rest is a blur
I'm running down a winding staircase
Through the lobby, onto the street
Running and running and the sound at my feet is water splashing
My world is crashing in the rain, and I realize
My life is a scene from a movie
Where I played the wrong part
Fell off of the screen when the villain, broke my heart
This night I will always remember, as the moment I learned
I'm best on the stage in a drama
Where love's returned
Last hour of the night before the morning light
When anyone who out ain't right
And I'm running alone, like a fool of my own
He's racing after me
Must have chosen to chase after me
So I let him catch me cause he left her there
Snatches my arm and says he wouldn't dare let me leave upset
It's okay well
Since we're putting on a show
I start screaming, let me go
He says no, he's holding
I'm folding, it's cold
And I'm heading to hurt him like he hurt me
Under the street light, in a fight
And the thunder claps my pain, and I realize
My life is a scene from a movie
Where I played the wrong part
Fell off of the screen when the villain, broke my heart
This night, I will always remember, as the moment I learn
I'm best on the stage in a drama

Satisfied,Who I Really Am,https://open.spotify.com/album/07D4Uocg83G7iPN8BZVNIh,2025,366894,"A toast to the groom, to the bride
From your sister who is always by your side
To your union and the hope that you provide
May you always be satisfied
♪
I remember that night
I just might regret that night for the rest of my days
I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise
I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can't quite place
But Alexander, I'll never forget the first time I saw your face
I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said ""Hi"" I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, every part aflame
This is not a game
I'm sure I don't know what you mean, you forget yourself
Is that right?
Heard you've never been satisfied
My name is Angelica Schuyler
Where's your family from? Yes
Ooh-ooh-ah
So so so
So this is what it feels like to match wits with someone at your level
What the hell is the catch?
It's the feeling of freedom, of seeing the light
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite
You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Everything we said in total agreement
It's a dream and it's a bit a dance
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance
He's a bit of a flirt but I'mma give him a chance
I asked about his family did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance
He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants
Handsome, boy, does he know it
Peach fuzz and he can't even grow it
I want to take him for away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is
(Helpless)
And I know she is (Helpless)
And her eyes are just (Helpless)
And I realise three fundamental truths at the exact same time
(Number one)
I'm a girl in a world in which my only job is to marry rich
My father has no son so I'm the one who has to social climb for one
Cause I'm the oldest and the wittiest
And the gossip in New York City is insidious
And Alexander is penniless (haha)
That doesn't mean I want him any less
(Number two)
He's after me cause I'm a Schuyler sister that elevates his status
I'd have to be naive to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduced him to Eliza now that's his bride
Nice going Angelica, he was right, you will never be satisfied
(Number three)
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
He'd be mine
She would say ""I'm fine"", she'd be lying
But when I fantasise at night it's Alexander's eyes
As I romanticise what might have been
If I hadn't sized him up so quickly
At least she's his wife
At least I keep his eyes in my life
A toast to the groom, to the bride
From your sister who is always by your side
To your union and the hope that you provide
May you always be satisfied
And I know she'll be happy as his bride
And I know he will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied",https://open.spotify.com/track/74mkYwp6R5H1q2pXQEizBC,276
