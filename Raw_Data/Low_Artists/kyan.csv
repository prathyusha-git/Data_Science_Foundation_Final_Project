She's the girl in the poster
But when you look a little closer
You see the rollercoasters
Burn those blue eyes greener, oh
Even superstars get older
The girl who lost her mind
These are dark, dark
These are dark, dark times
These are dark, dark times
These are dark, dark times
These are dark, dark times, yeah
Devil's in the lunch room
Then it's demons in the line
Yeah, ghosts in my hallway

You see the rollercoasters
Burn those blue eyes greener, oh
Even superstars get older
The girl who lost her mind
These are dark, dark
These are dark, dark times
Oh yeah!

No, I don't want your lies,
There's nowhere to hide
No, I don't want your tears,

When every single fuse is blown

Did you wonder where I went
I've been asleep for the last year
Skipping on life
Saved a ton on the rent
Checking in to the nightmare
A key card for my descent
I stayed down on the bottom floor
Stuck in four walls that I wouldn't recommend
No
And I've never felt that down
I've been to the edge and back around now
And I never thought I'd make it out
But now I'm awake
Everything feels like summer

Now I'm awake
Everything feels like summer

Did you know I was gone
Can you remember when
I've been asleep for the last year
I was so tired
Maybe it was heaven sent
Was there a dream inside the nightmare
Maybe I'd do it all again

Looping down there
It could still be cold up here

We put feelings in our mouths (mouths)
And built a wall around the garden,

This room
Is the only thing we trust
Because the TV says that what's out there
is still too dangerous (it's too dangerous)

keep the neighbors out (we gotta keep the neighbors out)

Echoed on the water rise
