Habits,The Death of Slim Shady (Coup De Grâce),https://open.spotify.com/album/3kjHLu1pL7tdY88GFwEkl6,2024,80738987,"Been waiting a long time for this shit (ah)
Long time no see (ah)
Thought you got rid of my ass, huh? (Let me go, you sick fuck)
Alright, here's what we're gonna do (piece of shit)
You take this (no)
Or I put a bullet between your fucking eyes (I don't wanna)
Here (fuck, no) then we'll split it (no)
Half an Ativan, I'm drivin' straight at a van
In a black Sedan, fast as I can
In Pakistan gettin' chased by a pack of Stans
You know how I roll, bitch (what?) I'm an avalanche
This my shit, I'm gonna spit it how I wanna spit it
Whoever gets offended, suck a dick and fuck a critic
'Bout to get retarded on this motherfuckin' shit, it
""You can't say retarded,"" shut up, midget (the fuck?)
And I've been tryna break the habit of sayin' any R words
But I'm still an addict, so it's getting harder (ah)
Been callin' bitches ""hoes"" since a kindergartner
This is Jimmy Carter, now I'm kitty-cornered (what?)
Sittin' in PC court with a shitty lawyer (shit), like damn
You got an addiction, man
I know you can't get rid of me forever 'cause you know that I'm prescription, man
Goddamn, I miss you, Slim (whoo)
You got an addiction, man
I know you can't get rid of me forever 'cause you know that I'm prescription, man
Next time, I'll be in your vein (yeah)
Was just a kid from Detroit who knew how to destroy the booth
And had a point to prove (yeah), and I'm missin' (what?)
Venomous, still I poison youth, sentences (yeah)
I'm pennin' are just to toy with you
Which is a joy to do, Slim is just (what?)
A lyricist here to voice his true sentiments (yeah), got the women pissed
And it seems like men are just (what?) off growing a huge clitoris (pussies)
Yeah, I probably annoyed a few feminists
I reminisce on them blowing a fuse over my points of views
Still I'm devoid of two shits to give (yeah)
My thinkin' is primitive
But when it comes to givin' it to anybody, boy, is Bruce generous (marshall)
And I'm 'bout as much of boy as Bruce Jenner is (damn)
'Cause I'm not a boy, I'm a man, bitch, man-bitch (ha-ha)
My speech is free as his choice to choose gender is (man)
This shit is like opioid abuse, isn't it? (Yup)
You got an addiction, man
I know you can't get rid of me forever 'cause you know that I'm prescription, man
Goddamn, I miss you, Slim (whoo, uh)
You got an addiction, man
I know you can't get rid of me forever 'cause you know that I'm prescription, man
Next time, I'll be in your veins
There's times when I lay down to sleep, I argue with myself
Am I the only one who thinks it's weird? Do I need help?
Just a little bit, no, a lot of it, I really, really gotta quit
Something's wrong with me, my God, old habits die hard
Look at you
What's the matter with you people?
You're sad that people are mean?
Well, I'm sorry, the world isn't one big liberal arts college campus
F- you, you're all pricks
Mom shaming, dad shaming (ah), yeah
Fat shaming (what?) Man-splaining, blah (pfft)
Cry babies attack Shady, wah
Mad 'cause they can't tame me (get it)
Here come the censors (look out), like the Avengers
And they assemble like Prince and then turn
A word like ""ginger"" into the N-word
All these pronouns (ah) I can't remember (damn)
They or them, theirs? (Who?) His or him, hers? (Ah)
Into them girls who bought tits to get attention
Then get hit on by ugly men who are (creep)
Not in your league, so you pretend you're a victim
And me-too 'em (ah), outraged, how fake? (What?)
Nowadays, some gals, they (what?) just clout-chase (yeah)
Look at me with sour grapes and your brow raised
Bitch, you ain't about head (what?) About face (whoo)
Little white, middle-age, upper-middle-class
With a glass of wine and your cigarette
Bitch, get off the internet (yeah), you ain't even fed your kids dinner yet (still)
Parental discretion, mental aggression, my head's a Smith & Wesson
You're messin' with a lethal weapon, like an evil stepdad
I got an infrared like the ginger stepkid who pissed the bed
I do this shit in jest and it's just a messin' up with your head
And if men wanna wear lipstick and women's underwear
Who cares? Their shit is their business, now bear witness
Beware, bitches, the Blair Witch on you scared bitches
I'm surreptitious (what?) on square business
Just attacked my therapist with a pair of scissors like ""Merry Christmas""
Dressed as a Hare Krishna, terrorist with a hair trigger (whoo)
But with these buttons I'm always pushing (yeah), pain I'm always inflicting (what?)
Protestors outside the Shady offices livid (yeah)
It'll make you think that you had the game on lock 'til they pick it (trick it)
Only way for me to explain it is I'm conflicted (what?)
Walkin' on eggshells, like if I take it too far, is this it? (Yeah)
Part of me gets it and wants to say I'm sorry and fix it (I'm so-)
So all my statements are basically contradictive (what?)
Like using the F-word for gay is wrong and offensive (what?)
And insensitive as if me sayin' the R-word isn't (wait)
Wait a minute, which R-word? Rape or retarded, midget? (Not cool, guys)
Would this rhyme be okay if South Park had did it? (Okay, screw you guys)
Would it make you less angry if Cartman spit it? (Goddammit)
And as far as what I just stated, regarding midgets
You'll probably think I'll just say that I'm playin', I'm not, I meant it (yeah)
Swear to God I see one of them little fuckers come at me
I'll pick it up by its legs and drop it and kick it
""Marshall, you're wicked, face it, you are addicted"" (I know)
But they gon' do me the same as DaBaby with all of this shit (why?)
Chappelle and Colin, they're callin' Shady misogynistic
While raisin' three daughters, two graduated from college with honor
Summa cum laude, my sense of humor is probably twisted
It's painfully obvious-tic
You got an addiction, man
I know you can't get rid of me forever 'cause you know that I'm prescription, man
Goddamn, I miss you Slim (whoo, hey)
You got an addiction, man
I know you can't get rid of me forever 'cause you know that I'm prescription, man
Next time, I'll be in your veins (haha)

This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends
It was 'bout busting raps and standing for something, fuckin' acronym
Cut the fucking act like you're happy, I'm fucking back again
With another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves, when the thought
Of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivate at it, wait is up
Hands up like it's 12 noon, nah homie, hold them bitches straighter up
Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff, came up rough
Came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos, I ain't deflate enough
Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt
'Cause this is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals, I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed up and got a blood bath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter, I can adjust
Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this mothafucka and if I don't make the cut, what?
Like I give a fuck but I light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
Through the side of a pump, 0 to 60 hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook
Me for bowing out I ain't taking a bow, I'm stabbing myself
With a fucking knife in the gut, while I'm wiping my butt
'Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like getting cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
'Cause I'mma fight 'til I die or win, biting the dust, it'll just make me angrier
Wait, let me remind you of what got me this far, picture me quitting
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut
It's survival of what?

This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all

♪
So get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, now mount up, jump in the saddle
This is it, it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick
If I don't do this music shit, I'll lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth
It's all I know how to do as soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue, I'm showing you the flow no one do
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit
So there's nothing for me to fall back on, I know no other trade
So you'd better trade your fucking mics in for some tool-box-es
'Cause you'll never take my pride from me, it'll have to be pried from me
So pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
Cause this is something that I must use to succeed
And if you don't like me then fuck you
Self-esteem must be fucking shooting through the-roof cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bullet proof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you
I must be allergic to failure, 'cause everytime I come close to it
I just sneeze but I just go atchoo then A-chieve

I know, right?
It's beautiful, ain't it?
Yeah, you happy now, bitch?
Yep
Alright, you got what you wanted
Yeah, what?
Let me go
Ha, never
Why does it feel like I'm always being tortured?
The bad apple spoils the whole orchard
Used to read comic books to learn more words
'Cause deep down, I'm a dork, just a core nerd
Meaning nerd to the core 'til I'm cornered
Then I'm the coroner
What shot is this? First, second, it's your third
Vision is more blurred, speech is more slurred
Can't even form words
It's like a dream up inside of a dream I'm trapped in
It's worse than I could've imagined, it's madness
Can't wake up, try my damnedest
But old habits are coming back
And now transgenders attack us frontwards and backwards
They laughin', throw midgets at us (ha)
This ain't no dream now, huh?
See what I mean now?
You see how they tryna make me out to be
Some kind of mean vile obscene, foul prick?
I kick one freestyle 'bout beating down a special
Needs child and these people freak out (Timmy)
Told you we'd get slaughtered for sayin', ""Retarded""
Aw, Marshall's gaining a conscience (fuck you)
This may come as a shock or have you astonished, regardless
Here's the thing 'bout retarded people (what?)
They don't fucking know they're retarded
Well, okay, you wanna fat shame
Bitch, two can play that game (what?)
You wanna judge people? (Yeah)
Matter of fact
Ain't you the same one who hated bullies calling you bad names? (Yep)
Then you turned around and did the exact same (so?)
Just immature and literally, you're still mentally 13
And still thirsty for some controversy
You still picking on Christopher Reeves
Yeah, but you're me and we're a team
So that means, we're in cahoots
That's conspiracy to commit murder lyrically
So clearly, you're the accessory like jewelry
You ain't the judge or the jury, you're just as guilty
You rip on paraplegics, man, seriously?
Oh, bitch, it's a joke
No, it's not, it's embarrassing (what?)
Like David Carradine found with a pair of jeans
At his ankles and belt 'round his larynx
I know, it's a scary scene
They're coming with everything
Little people are trolling me (ha)
They saying they've had it (what?) Up to here with me
Oh, hilarity (come on)
Nah, do your thing
Fuck deaf people, yeah
Well, between me and you
I think they've had it up to here with me too (what the fuck?)
Sorry, I'm not perfect as you, Marshall
Punching down on little people (yeah)
Not cool (whoops)
You just sound like a dick
Wait, nah, fool (what?)
When I say, ""Fuck midgets,"" I mean Ja Rule (oh)
And I know that Chris Reeves song was recorded in 2004 for Encore (yeah)
Fuck'd you take it off for?
'Cause he die
Man, that motherfucker did that bullshit on purpose to ruin the song for us (man)
Man, I never seen a bigger pussy than you
Bitch, look at all the shit the media's puttin' me through (what?)
'Cause of all the fuck shit that you pushed me to do (me?)
Should've knew when I found you
You were just too good to be true (hmm)
That's how we end up in these quagmires
You said you had my back, liar
But I helped you get your stacks higher (yeah)
That's diamond sales like sapphires
Rap buyers, admires pack lines of admirers
Now they say you lack ire
That's why your satire backfires (yeah)
Flat tires, no longer that guy you were prior to this
Yeah, and I scare you 'cause (why?)
I'm who you used to be (who?)
The you who didn't crumble under the scrutiny (wait, what?)
When it was you and me (yeah)
I gave you power to use me as an excuse to be evil (I know)
You created me to say everything
You didn't have the balls to say (yep)
What you were thinking but in a more diabolic way
You fed me pills and a bottle of alcohol a day (okay)
Made me too strong for you and lost control of me (you're right)
I took over you totally
You were socially awkward 'til you molded me (yeah)
You was a loner, a nobody
'Cause of me, you didn't take shit from nobody
Now look at you (what?)
Now you just a punk (man), little scaredy-cat (word)
Got you shook like Shakira's ass (yeah)
To look at your reflection staring back
Bitch (uh-huh), it's just a mirror, relax
Man, you're so full of shit, you need MiraLAX
Open your mouth and shit flies out, just lies
You thinkin' you can rip my ass, undo these zipties
You can just undo my feet and keep my hands tied
'Cause like an avalanche, I'd still win by a landside
Oh, you think so, bitch? Yeah, I know so
Okay, your hands and feet, I let 'em both go
Yeah, fuck now, ho, give me that gun, no, don't
Rear naked choke hold, let me go, yo
Here, take it, bozo (yeah)
Queer bait, you homo (you ready?)
No, don't shoot (here we go)
Bro, no, no
Now say you're sorry and you didn't mean any of it
I'm sorry Marshall's a pussy
He's Dre and Jimmy's puppet (what?)
Sorry he gives a fuck, but pretends he doesn't
God, you piece of shit, that does it (uh-oh, wait)
Yeah, bitch, this is for him (what?)
Christopher, MGK, Nick, and for Limp Bizkit and them
Midgets and Ben' (man, please) 'Zino, in addition to him
Will Smith and to Canibus, if you're listening
This is the end (okay, okay, I'll stop)
So to Jamar and Ja Rule and to all my feuds including ma (what?)
I'm welcoming you to my (no, no)
Last hoorah, I bid you goodbye (come on, man, don't do this)

The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far?
""Cleanin' Out My Closet"" and all them other songs
But regardless, I don't hate you 'cause, Ma
You're still beautiful to me, 'cause you're my Ma
Though far be it from you to be calm
Our house was Vietnam, Desert Storm
And both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we could drag this on and on
But agree to disagree, that gift for me
Up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kickin' me out? It's 15 degrees
And it's Christmas Eve, ""Little prick, just leave""
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat
Anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats?
Especially when Dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fuckin' boat
You'd think that'd make us close (Nope)
Further away it drove us, but together, headlights shine
And a car full of belongings, still got a ways to go
Back to grandma's house, it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest
So my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old
And that's when I realized you were sick
And it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though, but
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
'Cause to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though
'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
But I'm sorry, momma, for ""Cleanin' Out My Closet""
At the time I was angry, rightfully? Maybe so
Never meant that far to take it though
'Cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not makin' jokes
That song I no longer play at shows
And I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us and
How I just wanted you to taste your own
But now the medication's takin' over
And your mental state's deterioratin' slow
And I'm way too old to cry, the shit is painful though
But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you, Debbie Mathers
Oh, what a tangled web we have 'cause
One thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keepin' up with every address
But I'da flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps
And followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
If someone ever moved 'em from me
That you coulda bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney, dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night
As we were leavin' to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness
Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to
Thank you for being my mom and my dad
So, mom, please accept this as a
Tribute, I wrote this on the jet, I guess I had to
Get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to
Lay it 'fore I'm dead, the stewardess said to fasten
My seatbelt, I guess we're crashin'
So, if I'm not dreamin', I hope you get this message that
I will always love you from afar, 'cause you're my mom
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I want a new life (Start over)
One without a cause (Clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight (Yeah)
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well, my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girls
So I'll never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

Tryna figure out the difference
But I think—think the lines are starting to get blurred
I'm in a strange place
I feel like Ma$e when he gave up the game for his faith
I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints
Grimmin' every stranger in the place while I gaze into space
'Cause I'm mentally rearrangin' his face
I need a change of pace
'Cause the pace I'm workin' at's dangerous
There's nowhere to dump this anger, and thanks to this angst
I done quit chicken heads cold turkey
And started slowly roastin' 'em
'Cause that's where most of my anger is based
Fuck your feelings
I feel like I play for the Saints
I just wanna hurt you—aim for the skanks
Then aim for all these fake Kanyes, Jays, Waynes, and the Drakes
I'm frustrated 'cause ain't no more N'Sync, now I'm all out of whack
I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack
I'm goin' all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is, I'm strapped for battle
Suck a duck, crawl out the back—it's a bar fight
Prepare your arsenal
And beware of bar stools flyin' through the air and bottles breakin', mirrors also
And I ain't stoppin' 'til the swear jar's full
""You done called every woman a slut but you're forgetting Sarah, Marshall"" (Palin)
Oh, my bad, slut! And next time I show up to court
I'll be naked and just wear a law suit
Judge be like, ""That's sharp
How much that motherfucker cost you, smart-ass?
You're lucky I don't tear it off you
And jump your bones, you sexy motherfucker!
You're so fuckin' gravy, Marshall, I should start callin' you 'au jus'
'Cause all's you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo""
Evil Twin, take this beat now, it's all you
I believe people can change but only for the worse
I coulda changed the world if it wasn't for this verse—so satanic
K-Mart chains panic 'cause they can't even spin back the curse words
'Cause they're worse when they're reversed, motherfucker
Rekcufrehtom! (Rape your mother)— Tihs! (Kill your parents)
And these kids are like parrots
They run around the house just like terrorists
Screamin', ""Fuck! Shit! Fuck!""
Adult with a childish-like arrogance
Wild ever since the day I came out, I was like, ""Merits?
Fuck that! I'd rather be loud, and I like swearin'""
From the first album even the gals were like, ""Tight lyrics, dreamy eyes!""
But my fuckin' mouth was nightmarish
And from the start of it you felt like you were part of this and opposition felt the opposite
Sometimes I listen and revisit them old albums often as I can and skim through all them bitches to make sure I keep up with my competition (Haha)
Hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes
Borderline genius who's bored of his lines
And that sort of defines where I'm at and the way I feel now
Feel like I might just strike first, then ignore the replies
There's darkness closing in (Evil twin), there it goes again (My evil twin)
It controls my pen (My evil twin), but that ain't me, it's my evil twin
(Then I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin)
But he's just a friend (Evil twin) who pops up now and again (Evil twin)
So don't blame me (Evil twin), blame him, it's my evil twin
(Then I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin)
Welcome back to the land of the living, my friend
You have slept for quite some time
So who's left? Lady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber?
Nah, F with Christina
I ain't fuckin' with either Jessica neither: Simpson or Alba
My album's just sicker than strep with the fever
Get the Chloraseptic, Excedrin, Aleve, or
Extra Strength Tylenol 3s
Feel like I'm burnin' to death, but I'm freezin'
Bedridden and destined never to leave the
Bedroom ever again, like the legend of Heath-uh-
Ledger
My suicide note's barely legible; read the
Bottom, it's signed by the Joker
Lorena said I never can leave her
She'll sever my wiener I ever deceive her
Fuck that shit, bitch! Give up my dick for pussy?
I'll be Jerry Mathers I ever left it to Beaver
Get them titties cut off tryna mess with a cleaver
Golly wolly, I vent, heat register, Jesus
Ever since 19946 Dresden it was definitely in my destiny
When on the steps, I met DeShaun at Osborn
I'd never make it to sophomore
I just wanted to skip school and rap
Used to mop floors, flip burgers, and wash dishes
While I wrote rhymes, tryna get props for 'em
'Cause I took book smarts and swapped for 'em
They were sleepin', I made 'em stop snorin'
Made 'em break out the popcorn
Now I've been hip hop in its tip-top form
Since N.W.A was blarin' through my car windows
Leanin' on the horn, screamin', ""Fuck the police,"" like cop porn
Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped corn
Fuck top five, bitch, I'm top four
And that includes Biggie and Pac, whore
And I got an evil twin
So who the fuck you think that third and that fourth spot's for?
And crazy as I am, I'm much tamer than him, and I'm nuts
Then again, who the fuck wants a plain Eminem?
But no one's insaner than Slim, look at that (evil grin)
(Evil twin) please come in; what was your name again?
Hi! Faggot
Look who's back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
Two rabbits, a koala bear, and a ball of hair
And you're all aware I don't got it all upstairs
Guess that's why I'm an addict and it's so small up there
Peace to Whitney
Jeez, just hit me
That I should call the Looney Police to come get me
'Cause I'm so sick of bein' the truth
I wish someone'd finally admit me
To a mental hospital with Britney
Oh, LMFAO, no way, Jo-
-se Baez couldn't beat this rap—O.J., no
Hooray, I'm off the hook like Casey Anthony, hey ho (Hey ho!)
I sound like I'm tryna sing the fuckin' chorus to ""Hip Hop Hooray""
No, I'm hollerin', you got bottom-end like an 8-0-8
And I (base) whether we're fuckin' off that instead of your face so
Let your low-end raise, yo
Tango, what you think, ho? Slow dancin' or bowling?
You tryin' to hold hands with your homie?
What, you think I'm lookin' for romance 'cause I'm lonely?
Change that tune, you ain't got a remote chance to control me
Ho, I'm only vulnerable when I got a boner
Superman try to fuck me over, it won't hurt
Don't try to fix me, I'm broke, so I don't work
So are you, but you're broke 'cause you don't work
But all bullshit aside, I hit a stride
Still Shady inside, hair every bit as dyed
As it used to be when I first introduced y'all to my skittish side
And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize

Goin', goin', goin' down (look)
All of my niggas gon' ride with it
In the pocket, the rocket like Kellen Mond
Mama told me the power was in the tongue
But it probably ain't powerful as a gun
All of you little cowards get devoured
I'm givin' out flowers to anyone
I ain't been out the house in a minute
'Cause I ain't with it if the money is miniature
I been mindin' my business, I'm business-minded
I been spendin' some time with the minister
'Cause them niggas spinnin' shit and still sinnin'
In the City of God and it's sinister
Try to pray and repent in a synagoguе
Or a mosque, a temple, a church
Thеm brown skin's seen many niggas hurtin'
And murder's a common courtesy, for certainly

Murk, squirt, dirt, First (48)
My nigga doin' four plus eight without a court date
Talked the other day, he say he doin' okay
He good, he gainin' weight, then got a sharp shank
He made, he say they played, they gotta partake
Homie got a heart full of hate and a face full of war paint
Eyes all red, full of rage and it's hard to escape from a dark place
East side niggas from the A, niggas all ages
Tryna sell a pound of the dog cage
All the OGs 'round town was our age
Danger, sex and drugs, X and R-rated

I dribble and pass it to the cup and triple-double it
Get to the basket, get the cash and cuddle up
Cover up, bundle up, batter up (batter up)
Um, talk a lot of smack and now go back it up
Shawty wanna shag, wanna shack it up

Kyle Rittenhouse, spittin' rounds, used to TEC shoots (look out, like, ""Brrt"")

Neither was that, SIG Sauer lets loose
I don't condone gun violence at schools (nah)
But I can't get these voices out my head (hey, don't shoot you, you)
They're putting words in my mouth like alphabet soup
Got the most content on the continent
And constant compliments give me confidence (I'ma)
Across the common sense and incompetence (uh)
Incognizant, the conflict's a consequence
Of accomplishments acomplished through competish
I've conquered and conked them into unconsciousness
Through conscious, I conjure this King Kong and just

And left me so burnt, spent a lot of time trying to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I am coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed for
The way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over
You can just close the chapter
And go about your life, like it was nothing
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine
I'd never recovered but tonight I betcha that whatcha
'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice

Heart is saying: ""I will once I bury this bitch alive""

You expect me to just get over him Pretend he never existed

Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make
This appointment to come and see ya
But ain't here for ya empathy, I don't need your apology
Or your friendship or sympathy, it's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential, I peaked
Continue to peep, still bent low
Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo
Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders before hand
Surprised to see me, cat got your tongue
Gag, chloroform rag, gag almost hack up a lung
Like you picked up an axe up and then swung
Stick to the core plan, drag to the back of a trunk
By one of your fans, irony spectacular, huh
Now who's a faggot, you punk
And here's your Bronco hat,
You can have that shit back 'cause they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim
I hope you hear it, we are in a car right now
Wait, here comes my favorite lyric
""I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die""
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP
Just to try to get people to buy
How's this for publicity stunt?
This should be fun
Last album now, 'cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M&M
Matthew Mitchell
Bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you love your city so much
I figured, what the fuck the best place
You could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, town is quite near
I hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
As cops appear in my driver side mirror
Oh, God, police! Ahh!
Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
New plan Stan
Slim, chauvinist pig drove in this big, lincoln town car
Well gotta go, almost at the bridge, haha big bro it's for you
Slim, this is for him and Frank Ocean, oh, hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again!
I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
No, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
Backs to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged,
Yeah 'cause I'm talking a lot of shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollas
After the track is demolished
I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eating your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate, that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you every woman you insult
That, with the double-standards you
Have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything, you take for granted
'Cause Marshall Mathers the rapper's persona's half a facade
And Matthew and Stan's just symbolic,
Of you not knowing what you had until it's gone
'Cause after all the glitz and the
Glam, no more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off
Sad, but it happens to all of them
I'm the hindsight to say, ""I told you so!""
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call you the
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away
I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you had
But as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
Unless it makes an impact don't bother
So before you rest your case
Better make sure you're packing a wallop
So one last time, I'm back
Before it fades into black and it's all over
Behold the final chapter in the saga
Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice the magic that started it all
Tragic portrait of an artist tortured
Trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts
Blacker and darker than anything imaginable

If you're havin' trouble reading, will make it simple, he's Ezekiel
Easy name to remember (why?)
'Cause his rap name is the same as like ten minutes on stage is for me (oh), easy mill
Or should I say measly mill? (Haha)
Yeah, 'cause as sure as Ma used to feed me
Sleeping pills to keep me (yeah), sleepy still, it was creepy
'Cause indeed, she (what?) Could've easily Casey Anthony'd me (yeah)
These rappers, I'm above 'em, but punchin' down ain't beneath me (nope)
Cold as the wind chill factor, but the fact is I don't know when to chill
But every time I come out, they expect me to fuckin' reinvent the wheel
Rappers get praised for spittin' bars with less than the tenth of skill
Imbecile on the ledge like a Benzo pill on a windowsill
Now cancelled ain't the word for me
You need a term that's probably stronger than dirty laundry (Hell)
This controversy got me in the worst of quandaries
Feel like the Earth's axis, the world's turnin' on me
Like them cops in Akron, Ohio with Jayland Walker
Ain't caught this much flak in a while (nah), since back as a child (damn)
And all I did was say like one thing bad then it spiraled
Saw you crackin' a smile (haha), then relapsed into my old ways
Back into vile (yup)
Guess there ain't no civilizin' a savage, and I don't (no)
Give a fuck if you hate me worse than each track on Revival (huh)
Bitch, I'm back like a spinal (yeah), get it crackin' like chiros
It's the coup de grâce, I'm cooler than removin' claws from a cougar's paws
And throwin' it back in the wild (fuck), but you tamin' me?
Ain't gonna happen, and I'll live on planet denial (ha) for the rest of my life

Don't Front,The Marshall Mathers LP2 (Expanded Edition),https://open.spotify.com/album/5EUgcfO5OWxnniHR3QYFcK,2023,3197420,"Used to get bent, now I represent to the fullest
Pencil is full of insolent bullets
I'm like a Doberman Pinscher, Pitbull and a Rott'
Mixed with a toxic, the plot begins to thicken
I begin to spittin' like vintage Pac
Demented, demonic, sinister
Ever since the Doc' replenished me
The day he gave me that shot when I was just about to quit
So to not see him with me would be a shockin' image
And I'm the definition of what a concrete chin is
'Cause no matter how many times you sock me in it
And knock me to the canvas, even the boxin' critics
Know that if I get off to a rocky start, I'll always have a Rocky finish
Eat me broccoli, spinach, cocky? Nope
But I hope I offended you when I told ya how dope I am at
This and put emphasis on the ""dope""
So when names come up, in that conversation of who's the dopest, better throw mine in it
And don't mind me, while I remind you of the flow
You won't find anywhere
When it fires and I unload, my pen explodes
'Til there's no rhymes in it, reload in no time
Let insults fly every 60 seconds that go by, so you know I meant it
In school I was so shy, timid
Two pairs of jeans I'd alternate, bummy clothes, I 'member
Beggin' my mom for K-Mart MacGregors
'Cause those were new, St. Vincent de Paul
Those Pony's were used, and no size fitted
But kissed them old days, adiós, I did it
They said I was a gimmick
Now I'm the one that those guys mimic
Now you fuckers don't wanna go startin' no argument
'Cause you know I'll win it
Name a flow that's more authentic, and don't front
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, word
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Yo, why you frontin'?
You know I got you open, kid
Rest in peace to Big Proof
You was a beast, you lyrically mirrored me
Molded my flow off of you, your spirit's flowin' through me
I love you, Doody, without you I feel so incomplete
I'm no king, no need for rose petals to be thrown at my feet
I'm a thorn in your side, get thrown into a throne
Better watch the fuckin' tone that you speak
Feel like I'm in the zone, I'm in a whole different league
On my motherfuckin' own, it's just me
No opponents can compete
And I've never been known to retreat
From beef, be beat, follow trends or wallow in defeat
I'm still hungry as fuck, but can't even say ""Bon appétit!""
'Cause I don't know what to eat
Fuckin' microphone or the beat
Bitch, nobody's mind works like mine
It's nose to the grindstone time, holmes, your mind's blown
'Cause I rhyme like I'm still tryna get signed
Up in the Ebony Show-case
With Denaun screamin' ""Who the fuck passed you the mic?""
Never asked you like my shit from the get
I'd rather ask you to wipe my ass, bitch
You had you a nice run, now take a hike
I ever meet my match, I'ma strike that bitch first
'Cause on the mic I gotta represent the real rappers
The real rappers get their mothafuckin' skills crackin'
Word to Buckshot and Dru-Ha, why the fuck not?
You don't like it? Suck a cock! Almost forgot
Before I signed with the Doc, I almost signed with Duck Down!
'Cause Rawkus didn't make no offers, so mothafuck Loud
They jerked me around, so what's up now?
Wow, how much of an asshole would I sound like
Rubbin' it in and holdin' some grudge now? But don't front
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, word
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Yo, why you frontin'?
You know I got you open, kid
Late at night, used to catch a buzz, couldn't write
Now I write the type of shit to make you wipe
But wear diapers, 'cause you might leave a streak
I'm on a streak, windshield wipers couldn't wipe
It's hard to decipher what cypher I might jump in tonight
'Cause I'm hyper or somethin'
Needin' someone or somethin' is lightin'
This fire under me, it's breathin' new life
It's like I already died once
I guess some people only live twice, and it's funny
My days of being broke were so long ago
I lost all concept of money
But you dimes won't get a fuckin' nickle from me
Oh shit, I'm down on one knee
I'm havin' a stroke of genius—Elizabeth, I'm comin' to you, honey
From boy to man
And still make a whore moan, like a thyroid gland
I'm in another category, man
Don't group me up with them pop stars
I never needed a pat on the back to get at a boy, band
No offense? Yes offense
Precedents has been set that'll never get met
Middle finger pressed against Moby's nose
Shouts to Obie, the curtains closed on my show
But never forget that I'm the one you thought wouldn't make it
You can't take it, oh
Got a whole generation of rappers comin' up
That are nutty with the flow, but convince me you've heard
An MC since me who's as good with the fuckin' mincing of words
Without mincing words that'll make you feel like I'm pinching a nerve
Who's mentally disturbed
You might as well stick a knife in me and turn
It'll be like my skin bein' Indian burned
Hah, bitch, there isn't one, when will you learn?
Never been served, if memory serves
I'd battle that 'til my own recollection remembers these words

Groundhog Day,The Marshall Mathers LP2 (Expanded Edition),https://open.spotify.com/album/5EUgcfO5OWxnniHR3QYFcK,2023,26388191,"What is a nightmare?
The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream, a nightmare
I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious
'Til one day I grew suspicious, when I stepped on a crack
On Aunt Edna's stoop and got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start a new be-ditching
Missouri from Michigan didn't work, so we moved
Back to Missouri from Michigan, from Missouri back to Michigan
Someone put me out my misery, I can't do this again
Mom, please stick to a decision, discipline, last thing I wanna do
Is listen she's like Lex Luthor, bitch, her rules are Krypton-
-Ite to the walls and I've lost my power to see through them bitches
But I run into 'em, running through the kitchen
Pretending to be blind Superman, cause I had no supervision
But I did have a super power though, I could turn into invisible kid
Disappear out of sight, like a true magician
And one day Uncle Ronnie brought over this new, but different
Music into the picture and it become my new religion
I remember it clearly, even today
Move back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma nan
Always itching for something to do, was flipping
Through the radio stations one day and discovered
This DJ who was mixing, I say it to this day, if you ain't listened
To the wizard, you ain't have a fucking clue what you was missing
I'd zone out with my headphones, all I remember doing's wishing for shoes
Fuck them stupid Pumas bitch, it's all about them new edition Troops
You get them LL Cool J cooling system
Think I finally maneuvered to 8 Mile and Hoover
And somehow I saw my future is in this, that's how I know my mission
Little boom box booming, spitting, practicing numerous rhythms
When I sit in my room envisioning my dreams come to fruition
I remember Proof would visit, couldn't wait to play him my new shit
He'd go complete ballistic, go through the roof for his shit
It's like we knew the instant, we touched a mic that both of us
Too existed to do this shit, never quit, too persistent
We are the underground empire
Started a group of misfits, Proof had a proposition
If we all brand together, there ain't no stopping this shit
Come up with aliases, bipolar opposites and
Be ready to come off the top as sharp precision
If you got dissed at the Shop, cause if they caught you slipping
They'd take your spot if someone got to ripping you
And you forgot your written, opportunity knocks once, it ain't knocking again
It tried ding-dong ditching shit, I fucking got that bitch
In a headlock, cut off his oxygen Slim, it's not cordial
Like cocksucking cynderblocks in the wind, now I got my pot to piss in
Spot in that top position, hopping over that opposition
Looking like a dog is pissing, leg up on the competition
Promising complete dominance, Sugar Ray Robinson
I'm in a league Muhammad's in, Ali's my colleague bombing 'em
Probably end up on top of 'em, like stomping 'em like Ndamukong
I'm Russian like a Ukrainian LaDainian Tomlinson
Flow vomits in your face, competitors fall at my waist
You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face
So name the time, place to battle, bitch, I'm still in that mind state
Don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes
Cry babies, maybe my way that I use words is loose
But you turds better be careful how you choose yours
Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
And the truth hurts, shit no wonder you're sore losers
Now where's your bluebirds? Ooh
No more tripping in bird shit, this songs a self empowerment surgeon
Words of encouragement but this discouraging
The Rap Game's God, but the name's not James Todd, I'm just a wordsmith
So let these words lift, cause all I got is bars
For you dumbbells and doors ain't working out
Each verse is more merciless than the first, and you ain't got to wear
No shoes and shirt in this bitch to get served bloodthirst, revenge of a nerds
They will not escape my vengeance
And I'm the kid with them ears like Dumbo's gone
With the Uncle Ron, I'm turning into an unhumble Don
You blind dumb hoes, all I got is dick for you to come blow on
So stop the show, but I need a drum roll 'fore I go on
Better back away from the front row, get launched up your arm
Bigger than Dikembe Mutumbo on the fucking Jumbotron
I'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna crumble, you bambacluts
I'll leave you stretched out, like a fucking yawn
So mow the fucking lawn, your asses are blades of grass
And I'm fucking up this whole landscape of rap
The GOAT just ate eight acres and ate the vet
Who just make a path and take you straight to your favorite rapper
Oh look, my notebook with smoke cook
Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove
Soot, charred debris floating like Oakwood
Was burning, return of the no good and I don't quit
And the next thing I know something came crawling up from below
Something that made Godzilla look like a plane
And I don't quit, won't change, it's like a Groundhog's Day
So crowd around y'all, cause you may, so you can't pop your head

Scream life as I punch counter and bunches out of anger

In a dumb gown, black hood
With a scythe
Shit I laughed in his face spit
Bitch gave me an extra life, like take this
Now get your ass back in that game
Bitch don't take shit for granted
And don't take shit, give it!
Only bull you should take is by the horns
A mixture of Whitey Ford and mighty Thor
I Everlast, pen is mightier than sword
Finish writing then record
Replenish keep writing more
Nothing's riding on it but your privates are you're fighting for
So you fight, scratch, you claw
Backs to wall
No one was there to catch you fall
You pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off
You grab your balls, like they're gargantuan and
Ask yourself how fucking bad you want it
Pull out your pants, whoop your ass and flash it on em'
Nobodies gonna back you in the corner
Throw a hornet
No one's more ig-norant then you fuckin' four in the morning you're at the laboratory

Like there's nothing that's more important
MC's you better consider this a formal warning, you're in for it
Girl, what would you do if I said your body was off the chain?
And I told you I smile every single time I saw your face
I ain't finished bitch
I meant in half, oil the blades
Nobody wants to play

Besides static pain and big daddy kane
Break, beats and words
An erratic train of thought

Scatter brain
Yeah maybe why that explains
Why you're back but you don't rap the same
And you're looking way thinner
Because your hunger got you looking like
They took away dinner
Sugar ray leonard wouldn't sugar coat a fucking booger though
Just to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat
When you say you're a chooka what chooka what
Now fling that bitch from your fingertips
I hope it lands on another rap singers lips
Who can't think of shit
Anything of wit, that's interesting to spit
Whose king of this fucking English Lit?
Let your middle fingers flip
On each hand, whilst extending this shit
How low can you go?
Lower then Chuck D ho
Hear the bass of this in my voice
Rocky's back, where's my Adrian?
Nobodies crazy as shady in an eighty million mile radius
I'm what Tom Brady is to the patriots of rap
Not a man, I'm a weapon
Who just happened to be a rapper
Who just happen to be on the crapper
When it happened I had an epiphany
In the bathroom, I'd never be the same after
Now I'm back with an apper-tite
For destruction the fucking recipe for disaster
So let's eat cos' I'm famished
Every deed is a dastardly one
Evil its past it

While I multiply your undivided attention

Who finds him offensive
Got him climbing the fences
Lost some time to addiction

I'm an enigma

I'm gonna skip the veg and potatoes

Spit treachreous data
Shit that you would say to your worst enemy
This wretchedness is
What you get when you mix Treach with a Jada
And combine em' with Method Man and Redman
Whit meth-amphetamines in his left hand
And in his right there's a sledge-hammer
And pajamas, standing in front of a webcam
Beating himself in the head, til Russell let's him off dead jam
Maybe I need my head examined
Hannibal Lecter with a dead lamb
Hanging from his ceiling dripping with a bed pan
I need meds!
Swear to god cus' If I go off the edge
T.I ain't talking me off a ledge man
Heart throb at a fart, ah nah
More like a smart slob, part blob
That'll stab you with a sharp ob-ject
To the heart and leave claw marks
All over the Wal-Mart walls

F-, f-, f- can't take the stress

This is a fun, sweet! I just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete
It's usually once a month, this is some feat I've accomplished
They've stomped me into the mud for what reason, you stomped me
But how do you get the sh- beat out of you, be down and be upbeat
When you don't have no-thing, no valid shot at life
Chance to make it or succeed 'cause you're doomed from the start
It's like you grew up on drug street, from jump street
But if I had just kept my head up my ass
I could accomplish any task, practicing trash talking in a trance
Locked in my room, yeah, but I got some plans mama
These damn rhymes are falling out of my pants pocket, I can't stop it
And I'm starting to blend in more, school, this - helps for sure
I'm getting more self-assured than I've ever been before
Plus no one picks on me anymore, I done put a stop to that
Threw my first punch, end of story
Still in my skulls a vacant, empty void
Been using it more as a bin for storage
Take some inventory and as gorge as a Ford engine door
Hinge syringe an orange an extension cord and a Ninja sword
Not to mention four lynch pins and a stringent stored
Ironing board a bench a wrench or winch and a tangent whore
Everything but a brain, but dome's off the fucking chain

Before I get banned, kicked off Twitter
And TikTok 'cause they so damn ticked off, bitter

Hurlin' horrible slurs towards the world and
Why can't you make fun of people behind their backs like a normal person?

I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
Guess I got a way with words, I could get away with murder
Ever heard of Aspergers' It's a rare condition
It's what you're suffering from
When you simply don't care if it's an
80 degree day and there's no fricken air conditioning
And you can't see the bitch's hair is frizzing
Cause you got the windows up
Blaring the system in your Chevrolet Prizm
The devil ain't on a level same as him
Picture someone who revels in straight masochism
And imagine him giving an adjective an ass whooping
So bad they should put his ass in prison
A word bully, I verbally abuse verbs
Like they did something to me personally
Used to get bullied, so I'd cut class and ditch it
Now I bully rap, I'm the shit, faggot (sniff it)
Cadillac from a K Car
My ass from a hole in the ground, still can't tell 'em apart
Came straight out the trailer park screaming I'm proud
To shop at K-Mart and it became art
And I'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are
To this day I, still get in fights with the same broad
At the same Walmart arguing over the same cart
In the middle of the aisle whilin'
I don't give a fuck I don't play
Bitch you think you saw this basket first
You're ass backwards like motherfucking Bob and Silent Jay
Illest shit you could think I would say
Mind's like a pile of clay
When's the last time that you saw a villain with a cape
Ripped a gaping hole in it
Flipped out, ripped down the drapes
Tied 'em around my neck
Went down the fire escape of the Empire State
Slipped, fell straight down to the ground
Splattered all over the entire state
And straight to hell, got impaled by the gates
Saw Satan, stuck his face in an ashtray
While I sashayed around flames with a match and I gave him the gas face
And this ain't got nothing to do with a scale or being gay little faggot
But by the way, thoughts are getting darker by the day
I'm a combination of Skylar Grey, Tyler the Creator, and Violent J
It's a fuckin' miracle to be this lyrical
Paint my face with clown makeup and a smiley face I'm insane
Every rhyme I say, sons you like an ultra violet ray
I'm selling hatred buffet style, all the shit you can eat
$11.99 so come on and pile a plate
I'm throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise
With the rhyme I'm spittin' while I'm shittin' on competition
In the meantime it's always mean time
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell

I've been a career asshole
I don't see why these people always got my back
I done said so much fucked up shit, I was born a mistake
But I was put here not by accident
I had a purpose and that purpose was to beat a beat purplish
Slaughter tracks, I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this shit
I'm coming to get that quarter back
Like Ndamukong, the drama can build
Your mama can ask me for my autograph
Cause that cougar's a MILF, she's the oldest trick in the book
But I sure would fall for that
You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight
When I get on the mic I'mma snap
Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital
When I overdosed woulda caught a flat
If it makes you sick to your stomach acid
Indigestion, my suggestion's Kaopectate
If it feels like I'm running away with the game
It's cause I am, don't speculate, spectate
All I got is dick for days and insults for decades
But I get by with my wicked ways
Lady you can suck a dick till your neck aches
Cry till you get puffy eyes, red faced
But I'm leaving on this jet plane
You ain't fly, you're an airhead
And I'm sick of pounding a square peg in a round hole, sorry another catchphrase
But your baggage ain't gonna fit in my storage overhead space
Cause it just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods
Other words don't try to put your heart in a headcase
Cause baby, stable mentally I ain't
I need my meds, I peed my bed
I'm going blind, I don't see my legs
I keep on falling down, no wonder you can't stand me, I need my cane
Someone help me, I think my face is melting
If you felt these migraines and see these maggots eat my brain
This G-I-A-N-T hole in my empty head
If you read my mind, you can see my pain
And you'd see why I be this way
Ever since I was knee high playin' with G.I. Joes
Told these hoes shut their P-I-E holes, now peep my game
Cause I'm 'bout it 'bout it
Like a (like a) fucking (fucking)
Echo (echo) (psych) psycho on a cyclone cycle
Spiraling, here I go, I'm outta' control like no
Other mic go, stab you til' the knife goes - dull
I'm nothing but a hole inside your skull where your eye goes
Coz' I'mma sock it to you
Dyke ho, you don't like it
Get on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle
And ride it like a motorbike
I'm finna' blow the mic the whole night so
Strike up the fucking maestro, I'm nitro
And hi ho, hand me my shovel, I'm liable to dig my hole
Deeper, and it's off to H.E double hockey sticks I go
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell

I'm getting by with my wicked ways

I've spent so long livin' in hell
They say my lifestyle is bad for my health
It's the only thing that seems to help
Alaina, sorry that you had to hear me fall in the bathroom
Sorry that I missed you gradu- wait, Nate, I should just congratulate you
On being a dad to Carter and Liam, look at you
Little bro, sorry I left you, sorry that I'll never get to
Hold or hug my little nephews, Stevie, I'm sorry, I missed you
Grow up, and I didn't get to be the dad I wanted to be to you
Things I wanted to see you do, this is my song from me to you
Sorry, I gave up but I'm just so defeated
God, what the fuck do you want me to do?
Somebody save me, me from myself
I've spent so long livin' in hell
They say my lifestyle is bad for my health
It's the only thing that seems to help
I've been starin' at that video of Hailie
Almost daily of her playin' a guitar
In hopes maybe that'd give me the power to fight
But the addict in me's a coward
He told me that I can't do it, had a second chance, blew it
It's like I'm stuck inside an alternate reality, but I know (what?)
I'll turn it around and be able to
Walk her and Lainie one day
To the altar as proud as can be
Right now, I'm just weak
As I fall further down in this deep hole
And farther in the ground that I sink
As they lower me in my coffin
I feel the tears all fallin' down on my cheek
I'm a lost cause, baby, don't waste your time on me
I'm so damaged beyond repair, life has shattered my hopes and my dreams
I'm a lost cause, baby, don't waste your time on me
I'm so damaged beyond repair, life has shattered my hopes and my dream",https://open.spotify.com/track/4AVmC14ZG1nAKFIG67Jgyb,230

Not in the mood to play (nah)
Might start a feud with Dre (yeah)
And ask him to shoot the fade (what it do?)
All I do is spray, spew the hate while I fuel the flames
Who to blame for my screwed-up brain?
You could say, in the booth, I'm A-human A-to-the-K (aww)
(Hailie, look) look at them two little beautiful (yeah)
Pewter-gray poodles, how cute are they? (The fuck?)
Well, looks like them pooches are screwed today (I'm)

My medicines cabinet's big enough to fit a cab in it
Tablets, I spit like half of this capsule
It's travelin' like a javelin
Through my abdomen, my stomach's unravelin'
Might end up havin'
Slim say some shit you feel fucked up for laughin' at, yeah
And I'm phenomenal at it (what?), and that's problematic (what?)
But if y'all fanatics (huh?), maybe I'm your habit (yeah)
And I got all the dope (what?), so, send me all them addicts (get 'em all)
And watch me shoot 'em up (pew-pew) like semi-automatics (come on)
Slim snaps like a chin-strap
Had my share of lows, yeah, now I'm the exact (what?)
Opposite, just like a prostitute when she's gettin' smacked (now)
Pimp slaps, only way I'm hittin' my bottom, bitch (yeah, take 'em back)
I was five when they tried to say I stuck a live grenade
Up inside a microwave, I behave like a child, ay
Even when stakes are high as the price of Angus, I filet
By the way, I think I just gave Skylar Grey hepatitis A (ew)
But when it's sink-or-swim, I just say, ""It's not me, it's him"" (sorry)
There's a demon who's deep within
All I need is MD, or weed, or Henny, or Jim Beam, or Remy, or Seagram's Gin
Just to get underneath your skin, I would like you to meet my twin

Holy shit, Cait' Jenner just flipped (yo)
Told me knock this shit off and quit, and get off her dick (damn)
And I've had a bad day, I just slapped Dre
Do not tell me what I can't say (why?) That's gay (what's wrong with that?)
And not the good kind of gay either (what?)
Where two men fuck each other and hate beaver (whoa)
What the fuck? Wait, we've established I'm straight, see, the (no)
Way they try to make me the devil, the atheist (oh)
Shit can get a lot worse, these are my first thoughts
Johnny Walker, this is my third shot (yeah)
And I don't stop 'til the shots heard, pops for blocks
Got the Mossberg cocked (what?)
Couple choppers, two Glocks, a 2Pac shirt, doctors, and boxers dropped
Lookin' awkward as I walk into Oxford (stop, the fuck?)
So much ammunition, I sweat lead
And just bought you a new bedspread for your deathbed (ha)
And I just got it made like Special-Ed said
Word to Redman, I'm a meth-head
Used to get fed pet meds by my redneck stepdad
'Til I beat his ass to death with a cassette deck (ah)
So much bloodshed that when he bled from his head gash (yeah)
It's kinda like I'm a bookworm (huh?)
'Cause I ain't stoppin' 'til everything gets read
Call this sex-ed with a splash of necrophilia (what?)
'Cause when I say that I'm really the evilest
I'm fuckin' deadass (I'm fuckin' deadass, haha)
Maybe what I need now more than likely's a psych eval'

Rap God,The Marshall Mathers LP2 (Expanded Edition),https://open.spotify.com/album/5EUgcfO5OWxnniHR3QYFcK,2023,1235360100,"Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance (six minutes-, six minutes-)
Something's wrong, I can feel it (six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You are just what the doc ordered
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot
But for me to rap like a computer, it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""Bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run-D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay, I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!"" That's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""Way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""Hell, yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause-
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton-, no, Asgard, Asgard
So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a .9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything
You say is ricochetin' off of me, and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,"" 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head, there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard, be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?",https://open.spotify.com/track/1eKZjOja6i7iKS7N2Bzj8D,363

Everybody's looking at me (everywhere I go, I'm in the spotlight)
Everybody is looking at me (from the moment I wake up, it's)
Lights, action, cameras flashing' (shh)
Managers, sponsors, concerts, monster mashin' (yeah)
Moshin', everyone thrashin' (uh)
Laughin', lashin' in arrogant fashion
Type who might throw his underwear in the trash and
Wipe his ass with the American flag like Marilyn Manson
Updated Axl Rose
White version of Shaft, pimp slappin' hoes (psh)
Pull up like a Mac, jеt black limos
Stretch so far back, can't see the back windows
Steppin' out, pink hats, furs, and minks
Bitch on each arm, what the fuck you think? Shit
Right arm got that kid from NSYNC's bitch on it (Britney)
Left arm got that little pink chick on it
Me and Dre, at VMA's again
Pissin' off these lesbians and gays again, it's rainin' men
Strut as we walk the carpet
Stop under the tarp and talk to Carson (what up?)
BJ's pleadin' with us not to start shit (please, please)
Not to stomp the shit out of chocolate starfish (no)
Pose for the snapshots, paparazzi (ch-ch)
Everybody's eyes are watchin'
Just tryin' to guess what I'ma do next, waitin' to see
I just walk in, sit down, and take my seat, it's like
What the hell are you looking at? (I always feel like)
What do I look like, a crook? (Somebody's watchin' me)
I'm not no criminal, I'm just a plain old guy (and I have no privacy)
So keep them opinions and walk on by (oh-oh-oh)

So keep them opinions and walk on by (oh-oh-oh)
Arrested for gun possession
Have I learned my lesson? Fuck no, 'nother Smith & Wesson
Pissed off, pistol whippin', let's pick contestants
Mr Just can't use his fist for weapons lookin' around for some next shit to step in
Twisted rep, y'all got a misconception
I wonder would I be misunderstood if I wasn't from the hood, I was from some good
Uppity-dumb suburb in some upscale community?
I guess you can see what trailers do to me
Grow up, not give a fuck, fail in school and be cool as me
Scream, ""Fuck sluts, jail, and jewelry""
I never would've dreamed women ever would've screamed
My name louder than when she's arguing with me
It's hard for me to be humble and still have it in me
To rumble with anybody who wants to
I must prove I'm no punk, he's punched through
It's for uncle, I know you're watchin'
And I'm much too much pride to show you that I'm hurtin' inside
I'll never let my guard down, this curtain is wide open and I

My private life is springer, five times a night
See it via satellite, live right on site and hold on tight
Shit, fuck the Tyson fight, you might see - try suicide tonight
See, I'm done fucked up and told so much
It's probably the only reason I sold so much
'Cause y'all know so much, what's left to do?
But try to keep my pointy-ass nose out of the news
'Cause news flashes travel faster than lightning rods
Oh God, he's on stage with Elton John
He's got a motherfucking pink GLAAD t-shirt on
Huggin' a homosexual, flippin' the cameras off
But at the Grammys, thought Slim hated the Grammys
No, I said, ""You think I give a damn about a Grammy?""
You never answered me, now had you have asked me
I'd told you exactly why I wasn't here last year
See, there's nominees for the best album
Rap's got a separate category, now how come?
What are we, peons? Fuck Celine Dion
Pee on your corny award show you want me on
But guess what? That means you win
I can't give in and let y'all beat me again
Plus, this year, my record's almost diamond
I'm in the same category as Paul Simon
Ain't no other rap in the category I'm in
But they're callin' me to the stage, tellin' me I win
So just as I go to approach the podium
The crowd's goin' nuts like they're about to explode or somethin'
Expecting me to give some acceptance speech
That's gonna knock each motherfucker out of their seats
But the truth is I ain't have shit to say
Except, thanks, but you should've gave this shit to Dre
So what the hell are you looking at? (I always feel like)
What do I look like, a crook? (Somebody's watching' me)

While I devise a plan (kidnap)
Won't be talkin' about Purell (yeah) when Santa ties your hands
And I am an industrial-strength high-end brand frying pan
Rap is something that I've just had the skill at for some time
And I'm an artist who can draw a crowd like a diagram
Like drawing breath from your diaphragm
I've achieved every aspiration that I have had
Got a diamond plaque or two or three or four
But that don't change my attitude, I got a bad one
I got a bad one
She just gotta put up with my shit, I'm going platinum
You just gotta put up with my wrist, I'm going diamond
I just put Fidel up on the link, I'm going gold now

Lil' bitch, you can knock the shit about me being immature off
It isn't my fault, the liquor is often twisting my thoughts
You said you're looking for miniature golf
Thought you said looking for men to jerk off
Your mouth is a hole (what?), that means my dick is engulfed
Sick as a dog with croup cough (what?)
Biggie is gone and 2Pac (yeah)
And I'm still alive and you not the Wu, dog
So, who died and made you God? (Huh? Bitch)
Anything can set my mood off, attitude, I've always had one

This whole sub-genre with all these corny white rappers, I'm not a fan of it
It ain't my fault, but like sock puppets, I had a hand in it (oops)
This thousand bucks in my hand is just like what Candace did
When she turned her back on her own race 'cause I have abandoned it
One of the greatest who did it, look what I came up through
You never made it to the level that I made it to
So similar to a dinner table, I ate at you (sorry)
Haters, I made a few, but like when Three Stacks just plays the flute
I ain't got shit to say to you (nah)
And me offending you's nothing new (nah)
Fuck it, it's what I love to do
This is subterfuge, just to screw with you
And yeah, this much is true
This sounds like something that Puff would do
At the party with Aaron Hall
'Cause I just love to fuck with you (whoa)
A line of blush, foundation kit
'Cause it's you I make upset
Brain is dead, space cadet
Like when Ye forgets to take his meds
So when they get mad or angry at
A statement that I may have said
I just say, ""Man, I didn't say that shit, Shady did""
'Cause all I do is write the rhymes and then
Wait for that beat to play, spit 'em
Trigger finger, make like a green beret
Like he would get a submachine to spray with 'em (brrt)
I should go back to those sleeping aids
Because I'm so stuck in my evil ways
Then I'm fucked either way
The people still seem to think they want the old me 'til they get him
Got 'em up in arms like monkey bars (yeah)
The fucking bomb, word to Puffy, I'm
I'm blowing up like Kid Cudi's car
In front of his house where all his buddies are
Just another day at the office
But it seems like Marsh's fucking job is done
Mission accomplished, he pulled off his stunt
And pissed a billion people off at once (yeah)
But I gotta keep going Tyson on Kelly (what?)
I bodied him twice and already
That little motherfucker's back throwing subs (like what?)
Like a food fight at the deli
And that is why E got the attitude he got like Liza Minnelli
My male ego is the size of the belly on Jelly Roll

So do cripples (no), dumb quadriplegic fucks
With Christopher Reeves' luck (whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
Shady, Jesus, what the fuck?
Oh, here comes Marshall to try to clean this up (shut up)
What's the matter, Marshall? Your penis tucked?
Aw, the big bad rapper just get his feewings hurt?
Let me go, you bitch, huh, or what, genius, huh?
You gonna cancel me, yeah? Gen-Z me, bruh?

Renaissance,The Death of Slim Shady (Coup De Grâce),https://open.spotify.com/album/3kjHLu1pL7tdY88GFwEkl6,2024,74967927,"With balls in his durag, he sags, fearin' no man
He stands, pen in his hand like Edward Scissorhands
Will slice competition and just goes about his business
Anyone who knows about him knows about his shindig
Shenanigans, and all his wacky antics in the papers
Shady's danglin' a baby tangled in a blanket, stranglin'
And hangin' him over the railing by the ankles on some gangster shit
Child endangerment, dark brain arcane, but it Mark Twainin' it
You aren't tamin' it, sharp pain in the heart
Aimin' a bar, chamber to carve names in it
Start sprayin' and start ravin' on beats, stark ravin' it
You're at arm's length, you're in harm's way of it
'Bout to show your ass why I'm still a pain in it
You wanna know how I do it? I can't explain this shit
Mechanic's brain with a pinch of Big Daddy Kane in it
But I can show you the ropes 'til you get the hang of it
Elephantiasis of the nuts, element
Of Intelligent Hoodlum, Arrested Development
Cella Dwellas and Wise Intelligent, since elementary
Through Hell, I went, accelerant from lack of melanin
Failin' in school, smart eloquent
Help me to rebel against shit, so well and bent
So eloquently, yet, I was irrelevant
Soon as I quit givin' a fuck, I started to sell a bit
Now let's travel inside the mind of a hater
'Cause I don't see no fans, all I see's a bunch of complainers
""Kendrick's album was cool, but it didn't have any bangers
Wayne's album or Ye's, couldn't tell you which one was lamer
Joyner's album was corny, Shady's new shit is way worse
Everything is either too tame or there's too much anger
I didn't like the beat, so I hated Might Delete Later""
You nerdy pricks would find somethin' wrong with 36 Chambers
It's what they do to the greats
Pick apart a Picasso and make excuses to hate
So you can wait for your flowers until you're blue in the face

Rhyme Or Reason,The Marshall Mathers LP2 (Expanded Edition),https://open.spotify.com/album/5EUgcfO5OWxnniHR3QYFcK,2023,68265170,"Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(What's your name?) (What's your name?) Marshall
(Who's your daddy?) I don't have one
My mother reproduced like a komodo dragon
And had me on the back of a motorcycle
Then crashed in the side of loco-motive with rap, I'm loco
It's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun
Michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
'Bout to explode all over the canvas
Back with the Yoda of rap in a spasm
Your music usually has them
But waned for the game, your enthusiasm it hasn't
Follow you must, Rick Rubin my little Padawan
A Jedi in training, colossal brain and, thoughts are entertaining
But docile and impossible to explain and, I'm also vain and
Probably find a way to complain about a Picasso painting
Puke Skywalker, but sound like Chewbacca when I talk
Full of such blind rage, I need a seeing eye dog
Can't even find the page, I was writing this rhyme on
Oh, it's on a rampage, couldn't see what I wrote I write small
It says ever since I drove a '79 Lincoln with white walls
Had a fire in my heart, and a dire desire to aspire, to Die Hard
So as long as I'm on the clock punching this time card
Hip hop ain't dying on my watch
But sometimes, when I'm sleepin'
She comes to me in my dreams
Is she taken? Is she mine?
Don't got time, don't care, don't have two shits to give
Let me take you by the hand to promise land
And threaten everyone
'Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing
Now (what's your name?) Marshall (what's your name?)
(Who's your daddy?) (Who's your daddy?) I don't know him, but I wonder
(Is he rich like me)
Has he taken (has he taken), any time (any time)
(To show) to show you what you need to live?
No, if he had, he wouldn't have ended up in these rhymes on my pad
I wouldn't be so mad, my attitude wouldn't be so bad, yeah, dad
I'm the epitome and the prime example of what happens
When the power of the rhyme falls into the wrong hands, and
Makes you want to get up and start dancing, even if it is Charles Manson
Who just happens to be rapping, blue lights flashing
Laughing all the way to the bank, lampin' in my K-Mart mansion
I'm in the style department with a pile in my car, ripping the aisle apart but
With great power comes absolutely no responsibility for content
Completely despondent and condescending
The king of nonsense and controversy is on a
Beat-killing spree, your honor, I must plead guilty
'Cause I sparked a revolution, rebel without a cause
Who caused the evolution of rap to take it to the next level, boost it
But several rebuked it, and whoever produced it
(Hip hop is the devil's music)
Does that mean it belongs to me?
'Cause I just happen to be a white honky devil with two horns
That don't honk, but every time I speak you hear a beep
But lyrically I never hear a peep, not even a whisper
Rappers better stay clear of me, bitch, 'cause it's the-
It's the time of the season
When hate runs high
And this time, I won't give it to you easy
(When I take) when I take back what's mine with pleasured hands
And torture everyone, that is my plan
My job here isn't done
'Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing
So (what's your name?) Shady
(Who's your daddy?) I don't give a fuck, but I wonder
(Is he rich like me?) Doubt it, ha
Has he taken (has he taken), any time (any time)
(To show) to show you what you need to live
So, yeah, dad let's walk
Let's have us a father and son talk
But I bet we probably wouldn't get one block
Without me knocking your block off, this is all your fault
Maybe that's why I'm always so bananas
I appeal to all those walks of like, whoever had strife
Maybe that's what dad and son talks are like
'Cause I related to the struggles of young America
When their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
Now they're ripping out their fucking hair again, it's hysterical
I chuckle, 'cause everybody bloodies their bare knuckles, yeah, uh-oh
Better beware knuckleheads, the sign of my hustle says ""Don't knock""
The doors broken, it won't lock
It might just fly open, get cold cocked
You critics come pay me a visit
Misery loves company, please stay a minute
Kryptonite to a hypocrite
Zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it
Too busy getting stoned in your glass house to kick rocks
Then you wonder why I lash out
Mister Mathers as advertised on the flyers
So spread the word 'cause I'm promoting my passion 'til I'm passed out
A completely brain-dead, Rain Man
Doing a Bankhead in a restraint chair
So bitch, if you shoot me a look, it better be a blank stare
Or get shanked in the pancreas
I'm angrier than all eight of the reindeer
Put together with Chief Keef 'cause I hate every fucking thing, yeah
Even this rhyme, bitch
And quit tryin' look for a fucking reason for it that ain't there
But I still am a (criminal)
Ten-year-old degenerate grabbing on my (genitals)
The last Mathers LP that went diamond
This time I'm predicting this one will go Emerald
When will the madness end, how can it when
There's no method to the pad and pen
The only message that I have to sing
Is ""Dad, I'm back at it again""

Inside a boombox
One day for every pill
Or percocet that I ate
Cut down on the valium
I'd a heard everything
But death is turning so definite, wait
They got me all hooked up to some machine
I love you, Bean
Didn't want you to know I was struggling
Feels like I'm underwater
Submerged like a submarine
Just heard that nurse say
My liver and kidneys aren't functioning
Been flirtatious with death
Skirt-chasing, I guess
It's arrivederci
Same nurse, just heard say
They're unplugging me
And it's your birthday
Jade, I'm missing your birthday
Baby girl, I'm sorry
I fucking hate when you hurt, Hai
And sweeties, thank you for waiting to open gifts
But, girls, you can just open 'em
Dad ain't making it home for Christmas
Wish I had the strength to just blow a kiss
I go to make a fist
But I can't make one, I'm frozen stiff
I yell, but nothing comes out
I'm crying inside, I shout
My vocal cords won't permit me
I scream, but it's not allowed
You put your arm around Momma to calm her, wow!
I just thought about the aisle
I'll never get to walk us down
Never see you
Graduate in your caps and gowns
It's 'bout to be 2008
How's this happening now?
I've got so much more to do
And Proof, I'm truly sorry
If I let you down, but this tore me in two
The thought of no more me and you
You gave me shoes, Nikes like new
For me for school
Doody, I'm trying, but you
You were the glue that binded
So many things, time
I'd give anything to rewind it
I had to walk down my halls
And constantly be reminded
By pictures all on my walls
And I couldn't sleep at night 'cause
That image burned in my brain
Of you on the table
Me falling across your body
Not able to stand to save you
God, why did you take him?
I'm tryna keep his legacy alive
But I'm dying, where's Nathan?
Little ladies, be brave
Take care of your mother
Smile pretty for pictures
Always cherish each other
I'll always love ya
And I'll be in the back of your memory
And I know you'll never forget me
Just don't get sad when remembering
And, little bro, keep making me proud
You better marry that girl
'Cause she's faithfully down
And when you're exchanging those sacred vows
Just know that if I could be there, I would
And should you ever see parenthood
I know you'll be good at it
Oh, almost forgot to do something
Thank my father too
I actually learnt a lot from you
You taught me what not to do
And Mom, wish I'd have had the chance
To have one last heart-to-heart
Honest and open talk with you
Doody, I see you
I go to walk to you
And I can feel my soul leave my body
And float across the room
Nurses lean over the bed
Pulling tubes out
Then the sheet over my head
Shut the room down
Girls, please don't get upset
I see those cheeks soaking and wet
As you squeeze hold of my neck
So forcibly, don't wanna let
Me go, pillow drenched
Emotional wrecks
With every second
Each closer to death
But suddenly, I feel my heart
Begin to beat slow, then a breath
Machines go (Beep, beep, beep)
Must've guessed the cheat codes to this shit
I'm tryna rewind time like a tape
Find an escape
Make a beeline
Try and awake
From this dream, I need to re-find
My inner strength
To remind me
Even if a steep climb I must take
To rewrite a mistake
I'm rewinding the tape
(I don't want it)
I'll put out this last album, then I'm done with it
One hundred percent finished, fed up with it
I'm hanging it up, fuck it
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
And if things should worsen, but I bet you they won't
I'm pledging to throw this methadone in the toilet
Shred these old letters I wrote
All that old pathetic loathing, closing credits can roll
I'm proud to be back
I'm 'bout to, like a rematch
Outdo Relapse
With Recovery, Mathers LP2
Help propel me to
Victory laps
Gas toward them and fast forward the past
Consider the last four minutes as
That's the song I'd have sang to my daughters
If I'd have made it to the hospital
Less than two hours later, but I fought it
Came back like a boomerang on 'em

Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder
Of why we can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin' out, 'cause
I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
Yesterday was the tornado warning
Today's like the morning after
Your world is torn in half
You wake in its wake to start the mourning process
And rebuilding, you're still a work in progress
Today's a whole new chapter
It's like an enormous asthma
Thunderstorm has passed ya
You weathered it and poked its eye out with the thornbush that ya
Used to smell the roses
Stopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is
Stuffed, so focused on the bright side then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner faster, more assertive
Never looking back, may hit the curb
But every day is a new learning curve as you steer through life
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve but you have to
To avert a disaster, lucky no permanent damage
'Cause they hurt you so bad
It's like they murdered your ass
And threw dirt on your casket
But you've returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past
Standing at inferno and chant
I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
You're so familiarized
With what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died
'Cause you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive
Which means you will survive
Although today you may weep 'cause you're weak and
Everything seems so bleak and
Hopeless, the light that you're seekin'
It begins to seep in, that's the only thing keepin'
You from leapin' off the mothafreakin' deep end
And I'm pullin' for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healing
And by tomorrow, you may even feel so good that you're willing
To forgive 'em, even after all the shit you been put through
This feeling of resilience is building
And the flames are burnin' quick as fire would through this building
You're sealed in, but you're fireproof
Flame retardant, you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin'
You look down, 'cause you're so over 'em you could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling
As time passes, things change every day
But wounds, wounds heal
But scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow, today's going down in flames
Throw the match, set the past ablaze
So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this livin' hell
Still, a little piece of you dies as you scream
I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
I have learned from fighting fights that weren't mine
It's not with fists, but with wings that I will fly
And I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain

I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're trying to get out, just follow me
I'll get you there
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take this thing out these words before I say 'em
Cause ain't no way I'm let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say 'em or do something I do it, I don't give a damn
What you think, I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if a thing's stopping me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
No if ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shit'n
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shit's his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe
I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road
Ok quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that fuck your fillings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehhhh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't going back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack BLAOW
Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't
This fucking black cloud still follow's me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!
I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road
And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, Imma face my demons
I'm manning up, Imma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realise what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead
No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on, I promise
To focus only on handling my responsibility's as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
Cause I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazed and
I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm

'Cause now they all feel so small that they won't even wrap around me
Expect me to give in like a sinkhole (what?)

Borderline nuts, but I have no boundaries
If you get in my way, I'ma bury ya
Like a barricade around this area
They call me the grand canal be-
'Cause I'll be damned if rap ain't damned without me
Keep it a grand, like a damn finale
Coup de grâce as I shot to superstardom
Who'd have thought what my medulla oblongata screwed-up thoughts could do to toddlers?
But I grew up on ramen noodles, combination of post trauma due to mama
Got me off my rocker, human lama, but everything is not hakuna matata (nah)
But I pour my heart into the ink in these letters
I tear you apart as I piece it together
How am I so sick if I keep getting better?
Bitch, you ain't fuckin' with me at this ever
You got no cheese and no cheddar
You need some yeast, at least get your bread up
I hit your bitch up like Pac, told her to please keep her head up (head up, head up)

I show up like you just said speak of the devil
The devil is speaking, ""Now shut up,"" now shut up (shh)
I'm tryin' to take rappers heads off (what?)
I'm out for blood like the Red Cross (bitch)
Turn your GPS off and get lost (right)
This TEC is not for no TED Talk (brrt)

Asshole,The Marshall Mathers LP2 (Expanded Edition),https://open.spotify.com/album/5EUgcfO5OWxnniHR3QYFcK,2023,62126160,"Came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An asshole, that role I think I succeeded fulfillin'
But don't think I ever stopped
To think that I was speakin' to children
Everything was happenin' so fast
It was like I blinked—sold three million
Then it all went blank, all I remember is feelin' ridiculous
'Cause I was gettin' sick of this feelin'
Like I'm always under attack, man
I could have stacked my shit list to the ceilin'
Women dishin' but really thinkin'
""If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him.""
Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite when I'm rippin' shit
But since when did this many people ever give a shit
What I had to say? It's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm livin', put a dick in your rear end
That's why every time you mentioned a lyric
I thanked you for it, for drawin' more attention toward it
'Cause it gave me an enormous platform
I'm flattered you thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect
And battled for it, mad awards, had GLAAD annoyed
Atta-boy, they told me to slow down, I'd just zone out
Good luck tryin' to convince a blonde
It's like tellin' Gwen Stefani she sold out
'Cause I was tryna leave no doubt
In anyone's mind, one day I'd go down in history
Think they know now because everybody knows
Everybody knows
That you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows
So don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows
Thanks for the support, asshole! *scratch*
Thanks for the support, asshole!
Quit actin' salty! I was countin' on you to count me out
Ask Asher Roth when he roundabout
Dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history, well goddamn, honky
That compliment's like backhandin' a donkey
Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
Nah, I'm off him
But what the fuck's all this trash-talkin' about?
The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me
You knocked me down, I went down for the count
I fell, but the fans caught me, and now
You're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me
To take my belt—word to Pacquiao
Momma said there ain't nothin' else to talk about
Better go in that ring and knock 'em out
Or you better not come out
It's poetry in motion
Like Freddie Roach when he's quotin' Shakespeare
So what if insults are revoltin'?
Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke 'til you're bullet-riddled
But you should give little shit what I think
This whole world is a mess
Gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest
And a Glock just to go watch Batman
Who needs to test a testicles? Not that man
Half of you don't got the guts, intestinal blockage
Rest of you got lap bands
Stuck to this motto 'fore they put bath salts
And all those water bottles in Colorado, so get lost, Waldo
My soul's escapin' through this asshole that is gapin'
A black hole and I'm swallowin' this track whole
Better pack toilet paper, but I'm takin' no crap, ho
Here I go down the Bat Pole
And I'm changin' back into that old maniac
In fact, there they go tryna dip out the back door retreatin'
'Cause everybody knows
Everybody knows
That you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows

So don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows
Holy mackerel! I'm the biggest jerk on the planet Earth
I smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
For thinkin' we had some magnetic pull
Then screamed, ""ICP in this bitch! How do fuckin' magnets work?""
'Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable
Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical
I'm makin' up words so you can understandable, it's tragical
Thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen, that ain't practical
You crackin' a joke, it's laughable
'Cause me and love's like a bad combination
I keep them feelings locked in a vault
So it's safe to say I'm uncrackable
My heart is truly guarded, full body armor
Bitch, you just need a helmet
'Cause if you think you're special, you're retarded
Thinkin' you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina
You're a train wreck, I got a one-track mind
Shorty, you're fine, but you sort of remind me of a 49er
'Cause you been a gold digger since you was a minor
Been tryna hunt me down like a dog
'Cause you're on my ass but you can't get a cent
'Cause all of my spare time is spent
On my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'
Only women that I love are my daughters
But sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget I'm a father
And I push it farther
So, Father, forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent I shouldn't have been a parent
I'll never grow up, so to hell with your parents
And motherfuck father time
It ain't never gonna stop, a pessimist
Who transformed to an optimist in his prime
So even if I'm half-dead, I'm half-alive
Poured my half-empty glass in a cup
Now my cup has runneth over
And I'm 'bout to set it on you like a mothafuckin' coaster
I'm goin' back to what got me here
Yeah, cocky, and can't knock bein' rude off, so fear not, my dear
And dry up your teardrops, I'm here
White America's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird
If you stare at me and see yourself because you're one too
Shouldn't be a shock, because everybody knows
Everybody knows
That you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows

A king-size bed, but
I sleep on the couch
I'm Mr. Brightside
Glass is half full
But my tank's half empty
Gasket just blew
This always happens
Thirty minutes from home
Gotta lay a log cabin
Only option I have is McDonald's bathroom
In a public stall droppin' a football
So every time someone walks in the john, I get Madden
""Shady, what up?""
What? Come on, man, I'm crappin'
And you're askin' for my goddamn autograph on a napkin?
Oh, that's odd, I just happened to run out of tissue
Yeah, hand me that, on second thought, I'd be glad then
""Thanks, dawg! Name's Todd, a big fan""
I wiped my ass with it, crumbled it up in a wad, threw it back and
Told him, ""Todd, you're the shit""
When's all of this crap end?
Can't pump my gas without causin' an accident
Pump my gas, cut my grass
I can't take out the fuckin' trash without
Someone passin' through my sub, harassin'
I'd count my blessin's, but I suck at math
I'd rather wallow then bask, sufferin' from succotash
But the antacid
Gives my stomach gas
When I mix my corn with my fuckin' mash
Potato, so what, ho, kiss my country bumpkin ass
Missouri southern roots
What the fuck is upper-class?
Call lunch dinner, call dinner supper
Tupperware in a covered plastic wear up the ass
Stuck in the past, iPod, what the fuck is that?
B-Boy to the core, mule, I'm a stubborn ass
Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me going
This is the inspiration I need
I can never turn my back on a city that made me

They call me classless, I heard that
I second and third that
Don't know what the fuck I'd be doin' if it weren't rap
Probably be a giant turd-sack
But I blew, never turned back
Turned forty and still sag
Teenagers act more fuckin' mature, Jack
Fuck you gonna say to me?
I leave on my own terms, asshole, I'm goin' berserk
My nerves are bad, but I love the perks my work has
I get to meet famous people
Look at her, dag
Her nylons are ran, her skirt's snagged
And I heard she drag-races *burp* swag
Tuck in my Hanes shirt tag
You're Danica Patrick
(Yeah?) word, skag
We'd be the perfect match
'Cause you're a vacuum
I'm a dirtbag
My apologies
No disrespect to technology
But what the heck is all of these buttons?
You expect me to sit here and learn that?
Fuck I gotta do to hear this new song from Luda?
Be an expert at computers?
I'd rather be an Encyclopedia Britannica
Hell with PlayStation
I'm still on my first man on some Zelda
Nintendo, bitch!
Run, jump, punch, stab and I melt the
Mozzarella on my spaghetti, put in on bread
Make a sandwich with Welch's and belch
They say this spray butter's bad for my health, but
I think there's more white trash from the trailer
Jed Clampett, Redd Sanford, and welfare
Mentality helps to
Keep me grounded
That's why I never take full advantage of wealth, I
Managed to dwell within these parameters
Still crammin' the shelves full of Hamburger Helper
I can't even help it
This is the hand I was dealt, a
Creature of habit
Feel like I'm trapped in an animal shelter
With all these pet peeves
Goddammit to hell
I can't stand
All these kids
With their camera cellphones
I can't go anywhere
I get so mad I could yell, the
Other day, someone got all elaborate
And stuck a head from a fuckin' dead cat in my mailbox
Went to Burger King
They spit on my onion rings
I think my karma's catchin' up with me
Maybe that's why I feel so strange

Embarrassed, I just did Comerica
With Hova, the show's over
I'm hidin' in Kroger buyin' groceries
He just had front row seats
Told me to sign this poster, then insults me
""Wow, up close, didn't know you had crow's feet!""
I'm at a crossroad, lost, still shoppin' at Costco
Sloppy Joe's, bulk waffles
Got caught pickin' my nose, ah!
Look over, see these two hot hoes
Finger's still up in one of my nostrils
Right next to 'em
Stuck at the light
The fuckin' shit's takin' forever to change, It's stuck
These bitches are lovin' it, rubbin' it in, chucklin'
Couldn't do nothin', play it off
""What you bumpin'? Trunk Muzik?""
""Yelawolf's better,"" fuckin' bitch
They want me to flip at the label
But I won't succumb to it
The pressure, they want me to follow up with another one
After Recovery was so highly coveted
But what good is a fuckin' recovery if I fumble it?
'Cause I'ma drop the ball if I don't get a grip
Hoppin' out shrubbery on you sons of bitches
Wrong subdivision to fuck with, bitch
Quit snappin' fuckin' pictures of my kids

It's like there ain't a cloud in the sky, and it's rainin' out
Kool-Aid stain on the couch

I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable

Alfred’s Theme,Music To Be Murdered By - Side B (Deluxe Edition),https://open.spotify.com/album/3MKvhQoFSrR2PrxXXBHe9B,2020,43925595,"Before I check the mic (check, check, one, two)
I give it an extra swipe with a Lysol disinfectant wipe (good evening)
Coronavirus in effect tonight
Antiseptics on deck, I got every type (yeah)
I throw on my tux, then I (yeah) give zero fucks, then I (yeah)
Act like a jockstrap (uh), cup my nuts, then I (yeah)
Check my ball hair (what?), make sure it's all there (yeah)
Then call the pallbearer (yeah)
It's Music to Be Murdered By again, why stop?
Overkill like a pipe bomb in your pine box
You're all hitched to my cock (what?)
Went from punchin' a time clock to getting my shot
Then treated it like a cyclops
Like it's the only one I got
And my thoughts are like nines cocked (chk-chk)
Every line's obscene, pervertedest mind, got the dirtiest rhyme stocked
That's why there's parental advising (visine) every time I drop (eye drop)
So throw on the theme to Alfred, I'll channel him like the Panama Canal
But how could I get up in arms about you saying trash is all that I put out?
Bitch, I still get the bag when I'm putting garbage out
Plus, the potty mouth, I'm not about to wash it out
The filthiest, so all this talk about ""I'm washed up"", how preposterous
Because if cleanliness is next to godliness
It's obvious that it's impossible for me to be beside myself
And I'm 'bout that capital like a proper noun
Still on top the pile
Got me sitting on numbers like a pocket dial
Quick to call you out on your bullshit
Don't make me give that crock a dial
'Cause if I do, it's see you later, alligator
Made it out the trailer, then I made a vow to cater to no one
So hate, I've gained about the same amount that's in my bank account
So here's some more shit for you to complain about, I say the
Bars that never slack, but always get attacked (yeah)
I think they're gunnin' for me, it's startin' to feel like that
Like I'm marked, 'cause when I rap, it's like fallin' on my back in a tar pit
'Cause I have this target on my back (ew, yuck)
But if I ever double-crossed my fans and lost my Stans
I'd probably pop five Xans (yeah)
Go in my garage, start my van
Inhale as much carbon monoxide and exhaust I can
And doze off like
But odds like that, with these thoughts I have's
Like a giant getting squashed by ants
If this is the test of time, I'd pass with flying colors
Like I just tossed my crayons (tossed my crayons)
Small, medium, and large size cans
Sanitizers of all types, brands, cost nine bands
Which is a small price for Lysol wipes and
If my palms brush across my pants, I wash my hands
Shit, hold on, man
Motherfucker
Happy birthday to-
Fuck (shh, quiet)
I sit in silence in candlelit environments
Sipping Wild Irish while getting violent
Homicidal visions when I'm spitting like this
But really I'm just fulfilling my wish of killing rhymes
Which is really childish and silly, but I'm really like this
I'm giving nightmares to Billie Eilish, I'm Diddy's side bitch
What the fuck? Hold on, wait
""I'm Diddy's side bitch?""
Oh, I'm still east side, bitch
So until the E-N-D, since EPMD
Been givin' y'all the business (yeah), D-R-E and me (yup)
From the MMLP to MTBMB (bitch)
Bitch, it's 2020, you still ain't seein' me (haha)
So call me Santa Clause (Santa Clause)
'Cause at the present (yeah), I out-rap 'em all, I'm at the mall
Got your bitch in a bathroom stall, she could suck a basketball (uh)
Through a plastic straw (yeah) with a fractured jaw (damn)
My dick is coat check (ha), she wanna jack it off (yeah)
I'm so far past the bar, I should practice law
Mentally, I'm fucked up General Lee (duh)
Dukes of Hazzard car (yeah), get the cadaver dogs
'Cause this is murder, murder and you'll get murked, murked
This music 'bout to kill you, brr, brr (brr)
This chicken hit my phone, she said, ""Chirp, chirp""
I said, ""Hut, hut, hike your skirt, skirt""
Then go eat some worms, like the early bird
What the fuck is love? That's a dirty word
Make me fall in it, there's not a girl on Earth
Or any other planet, that's a world of hurt
And I won't buy a designer, 'cause I don't pander (panda)
But I'm back with so many knots, I need a chiropractor (damn)
And this the final chapter, 'cause I'm either frying after
Or they gon' give me the needle (what?) like a vinyl scratcher (DJ)
Yeah, I'm a card, like Hallmark
At Walmart with a small cart buying wall art
And y'all who claim to be dogs aren't
No bite, like a tree, mostly just all bark, arf, arf
But y'all pickin' the wrong tree
They call me dog because I'm bar king (bark, bark)
And I got a lot, yeah, like where cars park
I'd describe it as bowling (why?) ball hard (ball's hard)
'Cause the gutter's where my mind is and when
It's in this frame, better split like the five and the ten
'Cause without a second to spare, I'm strikin' again
And when the beat is up my alley, I go right for the pens (pins)
The cypher begins
I'm talkin' smack like heroin, the mic's a syringe
It's like a binge, Vicodin, I would liken to tin
My mind is a recycling bin
There's no place I never been
But I never budge and I never bend
You hyperextend on me, this game's life, it depends
Like adult diapers for men
Even when I'm rappin' less stellar
It's sour grapes, I still whine, I'm the best seller
Like a trey deuce, spray you as these shots penetrate through Dre's booth
And go straight through your grapefruit, no escape route
So you won't leave here just scathed with a few scrape wounds
Your ass is grass and I am not gonna graze you
But if bars were semi-mac's, I'd be the Mad Hatter
'Cause I got so many caps, and you don't have any straps (nah)
So you'd be a fitted (yeah), so don't act like you fittin' to snap
Bitch, I'll pee on your head like a Phillies hat (haha)
No stoppin' me, you're on a window shopping spree
Bitch, you probably go broke at the Dollar Tree
You never buy shit, all you ever cop's a plea
You're always punkin' out like Halloween
You rather opt to flee, you need to stop it, punk
Homie, you're not a G, act like you got the pump
And you're gonna cock the heat or get the Glock and dump
Bitch, if you shot a tree, you wouldn't pop the trunk
Yeah, and I'm buddies with Alfred, we about to
Disembowel them, gut 'em and scalp 'em, yeah
This is 'bout to be the bloodiest outcome
'Cause we gon' make you bleed with every cut from this album
So I'm choppin' 'em up like Dahmer
The nut job with the nuts that are bigger than Jabba the Hutt
I'm in the cut, and I'm out for the blood
It's lookin' like it's that time of the month
Carvin' 'em up with the bars while I sharpen 'em up, dog and a mutt
I'm gonna fuck your mom in the butt with a thermometer
Fuckin' phenomenal, but
Y'all'll get cut the fuck up like abdominals if you don't vámonos
I keep droppin' like dominos, the formidable, abominable
Stompin' a mudhole in my comp even if it's off the top of the dome
Son 'em, get the Coppertone, I'm at the Stop and Go coppin' the Mop and Glo
Got your stomach in knots like you swallowed rope
You out of pocket though, like a motherfuckin' wallet stole
Wait, why'd the beat cut off?

I'm not your husband (nah), you ain't my girlfriend
All I know is that (what?)
When I'm with you, I'm a different person, yeah
And I ain't never met a chick as perfect
Girl, you're a ten, so here I am (yeah)
Laying here with her again
Thinking 'bout you
She's asleep, you're texting me around two
Crying face emoji, you say, ""This is me without you""
We're sneaking out to meet at cheap hotel rooms or
Sex in the car, then I'll text you tomorrow
Do I question it? Nah, no objection at all
'Cause both of us are still involved, so
As I'm peelin' off, all I'm thinking 'bout is
I'm not happy here (nah)
With her
Rather have you (yeah)
Rather have me too
'Cause you're not happy there (you're not happy there)
With him
Rather have me (I know, but)
We just in too deep (I'm in way too deep)
You're laying there with him, thinking 'bout me
He's asleep, you say, let's meet around three
You went to leave the house, he caught you sneaking out
Now he's freaking out
You thought he was sleepin' soundly, woah
You say you're going for a drive, you don't question him
When he stumbles in, like, ""Where the fuck you've been?""
Then you pump his ear with what he wants to hear
Tell him you love him, yeah, wipe each other's tears
But it's been a couple years since we been doin' dirt
You or my girl, don't wanna see either of you get hurt
But now the lines are getting super blurred
Can't tell if I'm cheating on her with you or cheating on you with her
But really, nobody's at fault, can't help who you love
Hope they don't ever hear us talk
'Cause we both are getting sloppy
Probably subconsciously part of me's hoping we get caught 'cause
I'm not happy here (nah)
With her
Rather have you (yeah)
Rather have me too
'Cause you're not happy there (you're not happy there)
With him
Rather have me (I know, but)
We just in too deep (I'm in way too deep)
We're laying here with them, thinking 'bout us
'Cause now when we get home, we get jealous
Of each other being someone else's
Call us Long John Silver's 'cause we selfish
But I just wanna see ya
Don't care if it's at the Ritz or Motel 6
If I'm there with ya, rich or poor
When I'm laying here with ya, it could be the kitchen floor
I could stay in bed with ya starin' at ya 'til the morn'
I just wanna be your secret lover, yeah
I'd rather share ya than to not have you at all
So once a year or twice a month I'm here if you want it
Yeah, I'm open season
And I'm always game, so keep it a hundred, dear, haha
'Cause we could never be
Each other's everything's
You got a wedding ring
So it's him instead of me
But I'll be your second string
Now and forever because

Who can catch lightning in the bottle, set fire to water?
Coming out the nozzle on the fire hose, flyer than swatters

You were a slut at birth
If the world had a dick
You'd fuck the Earth
I tried to get over you
It doesn't work
You're still a cunt
I'm still a fucking jerk
Same as it ever was, yeah
Say it'll change but it never does
Ain't gonna ever 'cause
You're the cause of my pain and the medicine
Never met someone who played games with my head as much
Fate tethered us together like two felons
Must've fell in love with skeletons
Everyone's got 'em, thought that you were Cinderella but
Feels like I slept with the wicked stepmother
But how the hell am I
Still in love with the
Motherfucking chick there's at least a million of
They say love the one you quit
But this shit is killing us
Our love's on some other shit
I'm a glutton for punishment
You're the gloves, I'm the punching mitts
It's above and beyond us
Cuffing, I'm shoving the girl I love inside of an oven
If I catch you sucking another dick
You better unsuck it
You snuck in the crib and tried to jump under the covers again
Why am I tucking you in?

I gotta tell myself another lie

Wanna hate you, wanna kill you, wanna hurt you
Wanna heal you, yeah
Wanna lose you, keep you, bruise you
Beat, abuse you, treat you mutual
It's juvenile, delusional, as usual
You're beautiful, I'm average
I'm brutal, you're a savage

Yeah, it's kinda like we're tryna light a dynamite stick

Fight, hit, bite, spit, unite, split
Yeah, you're awful but you're mine
And they say love is blind, we see each other fine
But it's no wonder, I'm the only one you'll find
To put up with your shit, I need a plumber line
But nothing comes to mind besides the number 90
'Cause since '06 you flipped my fucking life, upside down
Now the sky's ground, look at my frown, it's a smile now
Look at my mouth, it's my eyebrows, make it rain upwards
We're on the ninth cloud, two insane lovebirds
I should fly south 'cause man am I great, ain't lyin' to myself
But I'm just plain stubborn, I'm Audie five thou'
But this is my house, bitch you get out
Then we duke it out, then it dies down
Then we say, fuck it, cry our eyes out, then
I gotta tell myself another lie

To get me by
'Cause I'm in hell
This is my goodbye farewell
This relationship is all that it's cracked up to be
Never lack lust in that, 'cause we act nuts
'Cause that's what attracts us
Trick you with a back rub
Tell you to relax then dump your ass in the bathtub
Yeah, now that's love, may sound pathetic
But fuck the world 'cause they out to get us
I love you but I won't exchange vows
Hey now, don't get carried away
No way I'll get married, it'll take a rain cloud to wet us
Yeah, but we're so insane 'bout each other
May take the same route and way out as Junior Seau
Break out Berettas lay down in bed and blow our brains out together
Who knows how it's gonna play out?
Or whether death's what our ending would be
One of us shot in the back while attempting to flee
But I go to bat for you, defending your honor
Yeah, no contingency fees, something we're not, nah
We're not pretending to beef, don't cost a penny to be with me
Time we're spending is free, we could be broke as a joke
Won't make a difference to me, don't have to give me a thing
Could've been a 50 cent ring from out of a vending machine
Love unconditionally, there's no other fish in the sea

You can't understand how I get my dough
50 Cent, I'm on fire 'cause Shady said so
I'm on fire (here we go now)
Everybody's in a rush to try to get the throne
I just get on the track and try to set the tone
I ain't tryna use nobody as a steppin' stone
But don't compare me, I'm better off just left alone (exclusive)
And I ain't even tryna go there with record sales
I'm just tryna keep it humble and respect myself
Say, ""What up?, Keep steppin', and just rep D12""
Keep my nose clean, stay away from weapons, jail
And livin' reckless, but if you go check my belt
You may see something else I use to protect myself
A vest, to stop a Ruger and deflect the shells
And send 'em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more, I don't got to
Got undercover cops that'll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people cross the line
But this motherfucker Ja must have lost his mind
That X, got him thinkin' he was DMX
Then he switched to Pac, now he's tryna be him next
So which one are you? X, Luther, Pac or Michael?
Just keep singin' the same song, recycled
We'd all much rather get along than fight you
Me and Hailie dance to your songs, we like you
And you don't really wanna step inside no mic booth
Come on now, you know the white boy'll bite you
I'll hurt your pride, dawg, and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to, with syllable after
Syllable I just slap you, killin' you faster
Than you poppin' pill after little pill of them tabs
Of that shit you on, but if you want it, you got it
You'd bump this shit too, if we ain't diss you on it
But if we lock horns, we can charge harder than Busta (Green Lantern!)
We bump heads with any motherfucker that wants to (yeah)
So what's the deal, where was all the tough talk?
When I walked up to you like, ""Ja, what up, dawg?""
How come you didn't say you had a problem then?
When you was standin' there with all your men, we coulda solved this then
I'm a grown man, dawg, come holla
All you did was slap hands, smile, and swallow
Another one of them little X pills in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you wanna be
Come on!
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You talk and soon you gon' see

Profitin' all for coppin' and scrappin' that property all for a possible monopoly
Try not to adopt my father's old philosophies

I'm walkin' across a suicidal tightrope intentionally
While the demons comin' out of me

Y'all call this fame, I call this shit alcoholistic infamy
Targettin' my kids and babies through population and gun control

Make a bigot racist uncomfortable
If y'all against talk and reparation
Then I'm not against the thought of separation

On my last rock, for my slingshot
Better haul ass, don't be no slow poke (nope)
Through the tall grass, run your ass off (yeah)
Oh no, got your pants caught on the fence post
Getting chased, by them Jackboys, think it's 'bout to fuzz
Like a lint roller they wait 'til it's late, they will tiptoe
Through your living room window
Take your Nintendo and then skate
Making you feel like you got bent over and raped
Little boy, you're never gonna get no rope chain
Get your shit stole, and your lip swole, I became bitter
As I got a little bit older, my hate
Was making me get cold, and began to get a chipped shoulder
Started to spit vulgar, my ZIP code had been skid row
But I ate every single beat that I spit over, the shithole I escaped
Then I began to explode, detonate, now the Eastside went schizo
Thought my name was B-side 'cause they flipped over my tape
And I won't hesitate
To get 'em all bent so outta shape
Oh shit bro, hold up, wait
I just tripped over my cape (Superman)
And I'm not gonna let 'em treat the paper like I'm chopping a letter
Dre'll tell you how I shred
So when you refer to the guy next to the doc, you meant shredder
Now the cops wanna set up roadblocks on my head
I got several bounties from feds in every county
I'm with a gal at a Checkers wiling
Bumping ""Fuck Da Police"" while I'm federales
This shit is like Romper Room
Why do I feel responsible for these kids?
All of whom I'm a father to
I'm a God to you, y'all better worship the water I walk on
Or y'all gonna meet your Waterloo
I get to flippin' the mic' as a murder weapon
I'm poppin' an extra clip, then cock and shoot, then I'm popping
Do not let me catch you slippin'
I will pop up and I'll take a spot from you
I'll get to doing what a leaky faucet do
But I ain't talkin' drip when I say that I'll get the drop on you
Singin' fuck all of you in Autotune
I am too volatile and too grizzly to bear
Yeah, shit is gettin' to where I can barely even sit in a chair

I don't wanna be alone
In the darkness
I don't wanna be alone
In the darkness anymore
Here I am, alone again
Can't get out of this hole I'm in
It's like the walls are closin' in
You can't help me, no one can
I can feel these curtains closin'
I go to open 'em
But something pulls 'em closed again
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
Feels like I'm loathing in Las Vegas
Haven't got the vaguest, why I'm so lost?
But I'd make you this small wager
If I bet you, I'll be in tomorrow's paper
Who would the odds favor?
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
I'm so much like my father
You would think that I knew him
I keep pacin' this room, Valium
Then chase it with booze
One little taste it'll do
Maybe I'll take and snooze
Then tear up the stage in a few
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
Fuck the Colt 45, I'ma need somethin' stronger
If I pop any caps, it better be off of vodka
Round after round after round
I'm gettin' loaded (Haha)
That's a lot of shots, huh?
Double entendre (Hello darkness, my old friend)
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness (Yeah)
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore

Service menu off a Benzo
I can hear the music
Continue to crescendo
I can see the whole venue from my window
That's when you know you're schizo (Hello darkness my old friend)
'Cause I keep peakin' out the curtain from the hotel
The music is so loud
But it's almost as though
I don't hear no sound
I should get ready for the show now
Wait, is this the whole crowd?
I thought this was sold out
(Hello darkness my old friend)
But it's only the opening act
It's early don't overreact
Then something told me, relax
And just hope for the show to be packed
Don't wanna hit the stage
Before they fill each row to the max
'Cause that'd be totally wack
You can't murder a show nobody's at (Hello darkness my old friend)
But what if nobody shows?
Panic mode, 'bout to snap and go
Mother- wacko at any second
'Bout to cancel the show
Just as fans below rush the entrance
Plan is a go to wreck-
Cameras in all directions (Hello darkness my old friend)
The press is about to go ape-
Bananas on all the networks
Commando with extra clips
I got ammo for all the hecklers
I'm armed to the teeth
Another - fall off the bed
Hit the ground and crawl to the dresser
Alcohol on my breath as I reach for the scope
I'm blackin' out I'm all out of meds
With them Benzodiazepines gone
Now it's just magazines sprawled out on the floor
Off the media
I'm goin' all out, this is war

And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness (Yeah)
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
People start to show up
Time to start the show up
It's 10:05 p.m. and
The curtain starts to go up
And I'm already sweatin'
But I'm locked and loaded
For rapid fire spittin'
For all the concert goers
Scopes for sniper vision
Surprise from out of nowhere
As I slide the clip in
From inside the hotel
Leanin' out the window
Going Keyser Söze
Finger on the trigger
But I'm a licensed owner
With no prior convictions
So lost, the sky's the limit
So my supplies infinite
Strapped like I'm a solider
Got 'em hopping over
Walls and climbing fences
Some of them John Travolta
Staying alive by inches (Hello darkness my old friend)
Cops are knockin', oh-
Thought I blocked the entrance
Guess show time is over
No suicide note
Just a note for target distance
But if you'd like to know
The reason why I did this
You'll never find a motive
Truth is I have no idea
I am just as stumped
No signs of mental illness
Just tryin' to show ya
The reason why we're so fucked
'Cause by the time it's over
Won't make the slightest difference

And things seem to be looking decent
Recently, but don't jinx it
It's like Clint Eastwood looking for peace though
Maybe not finna enter the priesthood
But at least should make an attempt
To show some remorse and to be some sort of a repenter
For the people, I've been a menace to
Not a preacher but a shit starter and finisher
Enter the mind of a thick skin, but a short temper
This patience of mine is thinner
Than twine is when I get attacked
So I might say something back that might offend you

They tend to flock like shepherds
The black sheep, but I'll be the worst thing

But pronounce you dead when they sound it out
So prepare for a rival, your arch enemy surrounds you now

Not even the doctors at the hospital
Are gonna shiggy-shock you back to life
It's im-piggy-possible to revive you
That's word to the Diggy Doc
Stiggy-stoppin' is not an option, somethin' I'm not gonna do
I'm the Iggy Pop of hip-hop when I walk in the booth
Dawg, I'm the truth, like Biggie rockin' with 2Pac in a suit
Talkin' to Proof droppin' a deuce
Fill up a syllable clip like a refillable script, cock it and shoot

We perish in the blast
But that isn't scaring us, we pass
Nowhere we're fearless, 'cause we're just
Ashes blowin' in the air
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
(We don't give a... no, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (golden)
Fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
We're goin' nowhere fast
'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no
Goin no, goin' nowhere
We're on the run of our lives
Goin' nowhere fast
Fuck doin' what you're told, act like a two-year old
Shit is soon to go kaboom and blow
Anyways; for MC's it's a funeral
When I'm devisin' this rhyme
'Cause I'm awake and you're mourning
That's why I rise and I shine
Like a new day has dawned on me
Gusto, guts, bravado
Nuts and plus I kick up dust and cuss a lot
I musta got you in somewhat of a debacle
'Cause some stuff that's awful
Really don't mean nothin' although
There's a lot of shit I said in jest that's tough to swallow
But if at times my heart it seems
Like it's in the wrong place, it's probably 'cause it's on my sleeve
Keanu Reeves speed of life, avoid or veer
Or just steer toward it, we're only lookin' forward
But where we're goin', we have no idea
Nowhere to go, but hysterical, it's gettin' warm in here
I set the world on fire, was born to be an arsonist
Just one spark and it's lit
But I'ma still get dark on this shit
Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitch—war machine
But you forced me in a corner
I'm sure to have somethin' for your rear
And in the course of the assault as torture gets more severe
Go to war with me, you'll end up blew to Timbuktu
I send at you a ten-ton nuke like Kim Jong-Un
And end up ruinin' your career
But when all is said and done
And at the end of my run I'll just rewind clocks, forever young
Make time stop, will I ever fall off? That day will never come
'Til the pine box, bitch, fuck you! I'm better than I ever was
'Til the bomb drops, hope it never does
But I'm not gonna sweat it 'cause
This world's screwed, it's already fucked
And I'm on top, so everyone's just
Ashes blowin' in the air (so we're...)

Goin' no, goin' nowhere

Goin' nowhere fast
You can't tell us nothin'
Hard-headed and we're stubborn
So, one ear and out the other when we're young, we're young
(We're on the run of our lives)
Who knows what the future for us could hold
Another shooter? Uh oh
(We're on the run of our lives)
No more tomorrows, we're done
And all we are is

Your magazine's so motherfucking thin you using staples
To hold it together it's turning back into a newspaper
And y'all got somethin' for my ass every issue
Thank you, 'cause I keep runnin' out of fucking tissues
And I could diss you but God I was sick of looking at you
At least now I can see when Nike's got a new tennis shoe
But-but I guess no good news is always good-good news
Moving on to bigger and better things (chicka chicka jeera)
50's blowing up, this year just keeps going up
What the fuck is going on? Who the fuck is Norah Jones?
Shady, wait a minute, baby, leave the whore alone
Just go up there and be humble and take them awards home
Bush has just declared the world a fucking war zone
Meanwhile, we got a war going on of our own at home
My fuckin' mind's blown, trying to figure out how to fight my own clone
Rhinestones are so nice, they shine so bright especially at night
After a hit of ecstasy, ain't that right Ro'oh?
Wait a minute I'm rambling, back to the matter at hand
It's Green Lantern with Elvis Presley the selfish MC
Back to the ruin rap and destroy the industry
Single handedly and oh man did we, yeah, me and 50
Obie, me and Twizzy
And Nelly and Missy and Jigga goddamn it's all a plan devised by the man
It's a conspiracy, against fake shit, and anybody who can't make hits
Or ain't dope lyrically
So fuck what you heard and what you read about
We ain't ruining rap, baby, we're just trying to weed it out
Shady in the place to be, see, and I got what it takes to rock the mic, right!
Still keep talking shit to me punk
'Cause your magazine's over in less than six months

Took a stab in the dark and broke the tip
Of my knife off, but your throat is slit
'Cause I'm cutthroat to the utmost with it
The ultimate
I just let the poker chips fall but they were supposed to fit
Now those days are over, scrapin' change in sofas

How 'bout that? I'm paid as Oprah
Think I may have broke the scale
'Cause the wait is over

A mic in my hand's a weapon

What they think about me for the last few months
(It's too loud)
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Freeze my crown all up in it
Slow fire
Don't fall on my face
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my
Gotta concentrate against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre in that first marijuana tape
Guess I got a chronic case
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your mama's face
I know this time Paul and Dre, they won't tell me what not to say
And though me and my party days have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I've forgot I'm the guy that made ""Not Afraid""
One last time for Charlemagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away
These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mocking Jay
Next minute, they get they style from Migos, then they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate I call it ""Walk on Water"" gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
You wanted, Shady? You got it!
Don't fall on my face (Yuh)
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate (Line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (Bbrrr)
Don't fall on my fate
Look
Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Or have his body baggage zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smacking bitches
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted like you had it
When you thought you had me slippin' at the telly
Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
Lacking with it, ""He ain't spittin' like this in his last shit""
Hoe, you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow up, let up
Call it traps 'cause it's a total setup
Hopin' that you rappers fall in that
Dre said, ""Hold your head up""
Kathy Griffin stackin' ammunition
Slap the clip and cock it back on competition
This is how I shot a head (Pew)
Gabby Giffords, my attack is viscous, jack the ripper, back in business
Tyler create nothing, I see why you called yourself a f-t, bitch
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's because you worship D12's balls, you're sac-rilegious
If you're gonna critique me, you better at least be as good or better
Get Earl, the Hooded Sweater, whatever his name is to help you
Put together some words, more than just two letters
The fans waited for this moment
Like the feature when I stole the show
Sorry if I took forever

Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
It's too easy
Just remember, I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detract this, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine
Increase the dose, from least to most
Then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves
They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to 'em
See the show, every parasite needs a host
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word of everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing in the prayer
A beacon of hope, for the B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere, some kid is bumping this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' a Oxford dictionary
In my pocket how I'm buryin' these artists
On the scale it turns to minus
Mines is various as hardly and what's scary is
You prolly can compare me to your car 'cause I'm just barely gettin' started
And as far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own
Thrust my pelvic bone
You should tell a phone and go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home
I belong here, clown!
Don't tell me 'bout the culture
I inspire the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9""s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, pissed and moaned
But I'm not gonna fall, bitch! (Yuh)

Nobody told me (I don't know)
Love is pain, oh (I know we just met)
Black magic, dark water (but it's like)
Surrounds me like no other (it's like I know you better than anyone)
She's got my heart in chains
We're volatile, I can't call it, though
It's like too large a peg, and too small a hole (yeah)
But she cheats and I catch her like the common cold (sneeze)
Last time, I broke her collar bone, she's intolerablе (yeah)
All I know is that the sex is phеnomenal, though
We're an unlikely pair (yeah)
Like two different Nike Airs
But I'm the same size she wears (Jordans)
So I think we're soulmates though (yeah)
People don't like us together, but like we care (not me, not me)
Yeah, but God strike me dead (yeah)
She knows that I would walk over hot coals
For her with both of my feet bare (yeah)
But soon as I ask to hit (ask to hit)
It's like she grabs a switch (grabs a switch)
And turns me over her knee (yeah)
'Cause my ass is whipped, yeah
And I got her back, but I'm spineless (yeah)
So when she stabs me in mine (yeah)
It's like I just can't feel the knife (what?)
As she pokes, jabs it, and slices
One minute, she'll build me up (up)
The next, she'll push me 'round
Probably why she calls me ""dumbbell""
She lifts me up (yeah), then puts me down (huh)

Black magic, dark water
Surrounds me like no other

Now she's all made up like make-believe
Probably why she's so fake to me
But what the fuck's it gonna take for me to make her see?
Strip her naked and take her keys
I been plannin' this thing for weeks
But I can't tell if I'm awake or asleep
But if this is actually happenin', sucker for pain
I'm stuck in this radioactive pattern
But her by her motherfuckin' hair's
All I imagine, dragon
She lunges, attacks, and scratches
But I ain't gonna stand for that shit
Like Kaep for the National Anthem
As I stab, I'm, laughin'
So much for witchcraft and magic
Abracadabra that bitch
No turnin' back, I'm blackin'
As I say farewell to the love of my life, I cut and I slice
I give her one last hug goodbye
Wipe the blood off my butterfly knife
Watch her fuckin' die right in front of my eyes
But in hindsight
Think I just wanted to see what her insides look like
As I pop another five Vic's
That's what this high's like
Look down, there's mud on my Nikes
Shovel at my side, blood on my mic

Perhaps used it (for what?) as a tool to combat school
Kids came back on some bathroom shit
Now, I call a hater a bidet (why?)
'Cause they mad that they can't do shit (haha)
And I know I'm such a dick, huh? (yeah)
And it must be fuckin' with ya (yeah)
To know I up and quit the (what?)
Prescription drugs and liquor (yeah)
And yet my buzz is bigger (wow)
Still wrappin' circles around you (yeah)
Like a boa constrictor (break it down)
Now I'm about to explain to you all the parallels
Between Elvis and me, myself
It seem obvious, one, he's pale as me
Second, we both been hailed as kings
He used to rock the Jailhouse, and I used to rock The Shelter
We sell like Velveeta Shells & Cheese (woo, let's go!)
But y'all miss the meaner me, back when I had felonies
That went over your head because you just fell on knees
You just literally knelt to me, I used to have no self-esteem (yeah)
I used to cry myself to sleep (what?)
Honestly, I need doubters because you motherfuckers (yeah)
Motivate me to make you look stupid
Believers, a little faith is all I seek from you
All I need to do is hear you say the same shit
My father said to me when I was just a week or two
""Marshall, I be leavin' you"" (haha, stupid)
No more Guinness Stout, but my belief in myself
Once again is stout (yeah), so many world records, I'm Guinness'ed out (huh?)
Shit you say goes in and out (oh)
My ear canals, so either my hearing's out
Or I don't give a shit about a thing you say
I just wanna feel like a king again

Sometimes, you gotta come back down (it's all going to hell now, man)
Stoop to someone's level (yeah)
Five dozen, flies buzzin' over your head
Call me the Grim Reaper, sleep is my cousin
You're dead to me now and I'ma be the last face you see
'Fore you die cussin' (yep)
My eye a tiger's and I'm a survivor so I will rise up and (what?)
Be triumphant 'cause when I'm looking at my legacy (leg, I see)
Bunch of dogs tryna dry hump it
Like Triumph The Puppet, so I'm like, ""Fuck it""
Pile the carnage up 'til it's so high, it's touching the sky
Let 'em all line up and attack
Single filing up in the stack
Call 'em toy soldiers (yeah)
'Cause they just wind up on their backs
Now the sky's nothing but black
But I am not coming back, I done told ya
I told the woke me to go to sleep
But still, they keep on provoking me
They're hoping to see me completely broken emotionally
But how in the fuck am I not supposed to be woke
When these fuckers just keep poking me? Now
I'm leaving Heaven
I'm leaving Heaven
Angels won't find me
Where I am going
I've been down, kicked
Like around six thousand times since I was a kid
As a child, picked on, clowned
Countless times I've been doubted
Gotta remind myself of it every now and then (yeah)
So the route I went's self-empowerment
In a hole, taught myself how to get out of it
And balance it with talents, wit
'Cause life is like a penny (life is like a penny)
'Cause it's only one percent
Who overcome the shit they've underwent
I went AWOL like what my back was up against
Don't tell me 'bout struggle, bitch, I lived it
I was five or six the first time I got my hind end kicked
Malcolm, Isaac, and Boogie jumped me and took my tricycle
And I don't know if I would call that white privilege, yeah
But I get it, how it feels to be judged by pigment
Besides getting it from both sides of the tracks
But I swore I'd get them back
Even if it meant selling my soul to get my revenge and (what?)
Thought of a scheme and it got me to thinking
If I can believe in myself, I could prolly achieve it
That's part of the reason I do all my talking with ink
And as long as I'm breathing I vow to smother and beat them
My God, what a heart of a demon, go at 'em and I'ma get even
Like I'm in the Garden of Eden, I'm 'bout to go off of the deep end
This evil is calling, I'm already seething and
I'm leaving Heaven
I'm leaving Heaven
Angels won't find me
Where I am going
Okay, so while Macklemore was keeping his room nice and neat (yeah)
I was getting my ass beat twice a week (what?)
Looking for a place for the night where I could sleep
Flippin' sofa cushions over just tryin' to see
If I could find some change and scrape up for a bite to eat
If Denaun and me find a couple of dimes a piece
25 cents each'd get us a bag of chips
We'd be glad to get that even we if we had to split
We'd do backward flips, looking back at it
I think that would fit with the definition of not having shit
Couple that with the fact my mother was batshit
Pop was a sack of shit, yeah, he died, but I gave half a shit
Yeah, which brings me back to the dear ol' dad that I zero had
Since a year-old, 47-year-old scab
Just to hear them words, ear-piercing
Like my earlobe stabbed with a needle for an earring
Should I feel upset? You were dead to me 'fore you died
Me? Tear no shed
Should I have made a mural at your funeral?
Had your coffin draped with a hero's flag?
Where the fuck you were at
When De'Angelo done hurt me real bad at the Rio Grande?
Never met your grandkids, fucking coward
Only gut you had was from your stomach fat
I couldn't see your ass going to Heaven
So I'm asking for a pass to go to Hell
So I can whip your fucking ass
I hate that I'll never get to say, ""I hate you"", to your face
No coming back from where I'm going
Sky is dark, my soul is black, hand on the shovel
Dig with the blade of it then I step on the metal
Vendetta to settle, tell the Devil
I'm leaving Heaven (yeah)
I'm leaving Heaven (you know, I should dig your motherfucking ass up)
Angels won't find me (just to spit in your fucking face)
Where I am going
(Holding my baby pictures up like you're proud of me)
I'm leaving heaven (fuck you, bitch)
I'm leaving heaven (you know what? Maybe if I had had you)
Angels won't find me (I wouldn't have went through half the shit I went through)
(So I blame you)
Where I am going (or maybe I should say, thank you)
('Cause I wouldn't have been me)
So you better, you better run (yeah)
You better, you better run (so I'ma let it go now, rest in peace)

So I guess this is what it is, huh?
Think it's obvious
We ain't never gonna see eye to eye
It's funny
As much as I hate you
I need you
This is music to be murdered by
Got a premonition
I feel the end is near
The beauty starts to fade
The joy has turned to pain
I hear the symphony playin'
Ten thousand violins
Souls floating away like feathers in the wind
They said my last album I sounded bitter
No, I sound like a spitter
Who ninety percent of
These hypocrites are tryna get rid of
But why would I get a chip on my shoulder?
I was considered, one time, as the illest
Bitch, I'm still as fly as your zipper
True, I just get richer
But if it was ever all about skrilla
Then I woulda quit a long motherfucking time ago
Bitch, shut the fuck up
I should go say that shit to Tech N9ne or the Jigga
Nobody said shit about 2 Chainz as long as he's been here, shit
No wonder you're mad, now I'm
Looking at them plaques, count 'em (Yeah)
I'm LL Cool J, bigger and deafer, that's how come (Uh)
I sell like four mill' when I put out a bad album (What?)
Revival flopped, came back and I scared the crap out 'em
But Rolling Stone stars, I get two and a half outta
Five, and I'll laugh out loud
'Cause that's what they gave bad back in the day
Which actually made me not feel as bad now, 'cause
If it happened to James
It can happen to Shady
They do the same shit to Brady
More people hate me than love me
This game will make you go crazy
'Bout to go for B-R-O-K-E
I was the G, the O-A-T
Once I was played in rotation
At every radio station
They said I'm lyrically amazing
But I have nothing to say
But then when I put out Revival and I had something to say
They said that they hated, they awake me
I lose the rage, I'm too tame
I get it back, they say I'm too angry
I need to get me some Dre beats
No, I should hook up with Tay Keith
Fans keep on pulling me one way
Haters pull me in another
Got more hooks in me than Swae Lee
'Bout to pick up some weights and lift 'til my tattoo of Hailie's face stretches
They said I'm just a whiner, I sound like a baby
I dish it out but can't take it
But I take it, dish it back out
And they get all bent out of shape
This shit's almost comical
Wait, and I meant no disrespect
I wasn't dissin' Tech, that was not a shot at 2 Chainz or to Jay-Z
They probably feel the same way because lately
Instead of us being credited for longevity
And being able to keep it up for this long at this level, we
Get told we'll never be what we were
Bitch, if I was as half as good as I was
I'm still twice as good as you'll ever be
Only way that you're ahead of me's alphabetically
'Cause if you diss me I'm coming after you like the letter V
Killing everything, play this tune, it's your eulogy
It's your funeral, prepare to die

'Cause with all this A-B-C shit, I'm startin' to sound like alphabet
Ha! I kill me, this medicine's counterfeit
I was misled by the sound of it
How am I gonna get turnt up on this Valium shit? (Yeah)
Checked in at the Royal Garden
To chill and avoid my problems
Until paranoia caused me to feel like I'm going bonkers
For real, think my toilet's talkin'
I spilled like, like forty bottles of pills
Think your boy is startin' to feel like a spoiled carton of milk
'Cause it just occurred
My girl's cheatin', I'm kickin' that fuckin' bitch to the curb
But the word fuckin' ain't meant to be a descriptive word
The type of bitch she is ain't no adjective, it's a verb
Hoe thinks her snatch is magical, but that's how she attracts
Men and who traps 'em and attack similar to an actual arachnid
Or a vaginal tarantula or black widow
In fact, it'll be nothing to throw that lil' Bitch with a capital
B out the back window out the black Cadillac limo like a whack demo
When I'm strapped, when I spit rapid, like a ratchet
A halfwit I'll aim at then I'll
Been fire bitch, I can't outrap Reynolds
A pad and pen'd be great but a napkin'll do
Return of the whack sicko
Head spinnin' like invisible scratch pickles
Yeah, Shady's back, see the bat signal
It's time to go bat shit
Like you accidentally ate a Louisville
Slugger and crapped it, I'd like to introduce myself
Hi there, bitch
My name is Marsh and, I'm out this world (this world)
S on my chest (Superman) like it's plural (it's lit)
Call me extra, extra terrestrial
Extra, extra, extra terrestrial
Yeah, I could keep beefin'
Fuck is the point?
I could make it really difficult for motherfuckers to come to Detroit
If you're still looking for smoke, I already gave you an L
I'd rather just see you in hell but
I should get puff on the joint (Diddy)
Wait, run it back, I said gave you an L, in hell
Puff on the joint, I am the blunt you avoid
Used to get jumped for my poems
When I was growin' up they said a slinky's a wonderful toy
My mother thought I was such a fun little boy
Oh, what a bundle of joy!
Until the morning she suffered a punch in the groin
From the tantrum I was throwing
Like a motherfuckin' disgruntled employee
I don't cut the beat 'til I fuckin' destroy it
Once I get going rain thunder it's storming
Puddles are forming, I hear somebody's voice
In my head say it's still a dream
Then he said kill emcee's
Trippie Redd, with pills on lean
Sippin' meds in the limousine
Getting head, guillotine
My name is Marsh and, I'm out this world (this world)
S on my chest (Superman) like it's plural (it's lit)
Call me extra, extra terrestrial
Extra, extra, extra terrestrial

So all of y'all can just suck a penis (suck a penis)
I'll do the opposite (I'll do the opposite)
Eat you pussies like cunnilingus (like cunnilingus)
There ain't no stopping it (there ain't no stopping it)
They say I'm such a genius (they say I'm such a genius)
When that kamikaze hit (when that kamikaze hit)
Now they call me, butter fingers (they call me, butter fingers)
'Cause I just keep droppin' shit (I just keep droppin' shit)
You wanna butt heads? Shut up Beavis, ha ha
I got your bitch with her butt out
I'm hittin' a lick and she stickin' her tongue out
You got no hitters, you might be pitchin' a shut out
She 'bout to give up the dug out
I should just live in a nut house
Right now, I live in an igloo (yeah)
And I'm not chillin' the fuck out
Treat you like a stepparent, does to a stepchild with red hair and
Plus I get dough like Ed Sheeran, so call me the ginger bread man
I'm a stan of Redman, ex clan and I'm a Treach fan
But I look up to myself (yeah)
Like a fucking headstand (yeah)
So why, w-w-why else, would I call myself an alien?
How could I hit a dry spell (yeah), I'm named after the wet lands

I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Give me some room (woo!), give me some room (hey!), give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move (boom, bap), y'all gotta move (woo!), give me the juice

Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys (woo!)
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time (yeah!)
I ain't no gangster, but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives

Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now (yeah, yeah)

In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down (bop, bop)
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shawty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now (woo! Woo!)
I said ain't no love for the other side

You in the wrong cab, down the wrong path

Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (vroom!)
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way (yeah), I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em (ah)
Wasn't in it for the trophies (nah), just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference? I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man, my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me, fuck you think? (Woo!)
I got a couple of mansions
Still, I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghostwriters
But to these kids, it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""
I said, ""I don't have any answers""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell, but I'm back on these rappers (yeah)
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, ""What a wonderful feeling!
We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!""
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta, ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap (yeah)
Let's recap, way back, MC's that (what?)
Wreak havoc on tape decks (woo)
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap (nah), and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact (yeah), where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable they know what button to press
Or what lever to pull to give me to snap though (lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention, I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya dicks, and I'm fuckin' back, ho (get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again, as I begin to thinkin' about
An evil intent of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eating a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me, I'm not a fuckin' record breaker (yeah)
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA (yeah)
But I roll 'til the wheels fall off, I'm working tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for like California
Wishin' rain to pour in that drought, y'all
Been prayin' for my downfall (yeah)
From the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy

My life's ridin' on the Autobahn on autopilot
Before I touch dirt, I'll kill y'all with kindness
I kill ya, my natural persona's much worse
You've been warned if you've been born or if you conformed
Slap up a cop and then snatch him out of his uniform
Leave him with his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn
Y'all niggas' intellect mad slow, y'all fags know
Claimin' you bangin', you flamin'
Bet you could light your own cigarette with ya asshole
Me and Shady deaded the past
So that basically resurrected my cashflow
I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
Though I ain't wrapped tight
My blood type's the '80s, my '90s was like the Navy
You was like the Bradys, you still fly kites daily
Catch me in my Mercedes, bumpin' ""Ice Ice Baby""
Screamin', ""Shady 'til I die!"", like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy
So I live it to the fullest 'til I'm Swayze
And you only live it once, so I'm thinkin' 'bout this nice, nice lady
Wait, no, stop me now 'fore I get on a roll (Danish)
Let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is
'Cause she's kinda famous
And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this
Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus
You morons think that I'm a genius
Really I belong inside a dang insane asylum cleanin'
Came to drive them trailer parks crazy
I am back, and I am razor-sharp, baby
And that's back with a capital ""B"" with an exclamation mark
Maybe you should listen when I flip the linguistics
'Cause when I rip this mystical slick shit
You don't wanna become another victim, a statistic of this shit
'Cause after I spit the bullets
I'ma treat these shell casings like a soccer ball
I'ma kick the ballistics, so get this dick, I'ma live this
I'm livin' life in the fast lane
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now
I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride
Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal)
Livin' life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal)
Yeah, my whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit
At war with a bottle, as Captain Morgan attacks my organs
My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins
I made a pact with the Devil that says, ""I'll let you take me""
""You let me take this shovel, dig up the corpse of Jack Kevorkian""
Go back and forth in more beef that you can pack a fork in
I'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy down
My tenement chimney now, the semi's the remedy, pow
Spin him around, enterin' in the vicinity
Now, was called M&M
But he threw away the candy and ate the rapper
Chewed him up and spitted him out, girl giddy-up, now get-get down
He's lookin' around this club
And it looks like people are havin' a shit fit now
Here, little t-t-trailer trash, take a look who's back in t-t-town
Did I s-s-stutter, motherfucker? Fuck them all, he shuts
The whole motherfuckin' Walmart d-d-down every time he comes a-r-r-round
And he came to the club tonight with 5'9"" to hold this bitch down
Like a motherfuckin' chick underwater, he tryin' d-d-drown
Shorty, when you dance, you got me captivated, just by the way
That you keep lickin' them dick-suckin' lips, I'm agitated, aggravated
To the point you don't suck my dick, then you're gonna get decapitated
Other words, you don't fuckin' give me head, then I'ma have to take it
And then after takin' that, I'ma catch a case, it's gon' be fascinatin'
It's gon' say ""The whole rap game passed away"" on top of the affidavit
Graduated from master debater, slash massive masturbator
To Michael Jackson's activator, meanin' I'm on fire off the top
Might wanna back up data, runnin' over hip hop in a verbal tractor trailer
Homie, they're sick, you could normally ask a hater
Don't it make sense, these shell casings is just like a bag of paper
Drop in the lap of a tax evader, homie they spent
Now make that ass drop like a sack of potatoes, what girl? I'm the crack-a-lator
Percolator to this party, be my penis ejaculator later
Tell you boyfriend that you just struck pay dirt
You rollin' with a player, you won't be exaggeratin' when you sayin'

(Let's see if see ever happened to you)
I, I hate
My, my stepdad
One thing that sticks in my craw
When I was six and I saw my stepfather hittin' my mom
Socked her right in her eyeball
I'm startin' to think I'm psychotic
With all the pictures that I draw
Shit that I've already witnessed, this probably twisted my thoughts
All I can hear is drama with mom and him
I can always hear arguin' down the hallways
The walls are thin so the noise is startin' to feel like the norm
My dog pissed on the carpet, he stomped it so hard
Doctors had to put it down
He killed my chihuahua, this motherfucker!
I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', bye-bye stepdad (stepdad)
Outside, I look like I'm calm
Inside, I'm a tickin' time bomb
'Cause of this motherfucker
Who sticks his dick in my mom (my mom)
Last night, he said I left the kitchen light on
But he walked in there this morning and purposely flipped it, I saw him
Hickory switch to my bottom, I counted 69 times
He swatted me with it, I'm cryin'
He just started hittin' me harder
God, I just wish I could just jaw him
If I could just get my weight up
But I'm just a second grader
This prick is bigger than I am
But I've been readin' at school about this shit called liquid cyanide
I'm fantasizin' at night when he's sleepin' at just the right time
Sneak up with a lethal injection
And put him down like they did to my dog
I'm talkin' euthanasia, like kids in Taiwan
This fuckin' shit's like Saigon
Neighbors called police on him
So many battery charges, dude's like lithium-ion
Then mom and him let bygones (bygones)
Just be bygones
So on eggshells, I walk and just try and not to piss this guy off
But this why I
I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', bye-bye stepdad (stepdad)
So this year, I'm goin' to the fifth and I'm tall
I'm five foot six on my block, I'm the toughest kid but I got
Way bigger fish to fry
Which is why I'm tryin' to get this bitch to fly off
The handle and wait for the fist to fly off to put this guy in a pine box
He's always lookin' for cash but tonight I've cooked up a plan
So this Christmas, I got some color books and some crayons
I'm layin' on the floor, in the living room with some friends colorin'
He walks by kicks my arm and goes, whoops, and just laughs
I yelled for mom (mom) and now she's rushin' to my defense
I stood up and said, fuck you punk, and I took off and ran
To my bedroom, as I fled
Knowin' shit would hit the fan
Slammed the door and hid behind it with the aluminum bat
He kicked it in
I swung it as hard as I could at his head
His noodle went splat, he fell at the foot of my bed
I'm a little bit scared but my anger's overtooken the fear
I threw down the bat and just started whoopin' his ass
Beat him with my bare hands
The big bad wolf ain't so bad
Ding-dong, the pussy is dead, the bully finally gets his
Stomped him until he pissed enough to fill a two liter with
Then buried him next to my dog
And if I go to juvie for this, I'ma tell 'em
I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', bye-bye stepdad (stepdad)
'Cause I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', bye-bye stepdad (stepdad)",https://open.spotify.com/track/7jHJpWa5n7MXwnPF8vA9pE,213

I do my best to try to block it (redrum)
I've been sipping on like, vodka (head's numb)
I'm blacking out, you better watch it (it's bedlam)
I thought I heard a voice in my head that said, kill
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will
I'm a long way away from where you are in skill
Foreign wheels, my bitch wearin' four-inch heels
She on the orange pill
And she about to start taking off layers like orange peels
Sacha Baron Cohen, Farrell, where am I going with this?
Oh yeah, a bar at will
And when you throw the iron in it, I'm all that still
The truth for real, I'm real true, call that trill
This is my house, this place is mine
Posted on any corner on any coast I'm on
You niggas need to leave that lean, Henny, and coke alone
Terror to the business, married to the strippers, T-Pain
Student of the game pre-Kane, you niggas Post Malone
Elite beat boxer minus the raps
Rollin' with at least three choppers, Ryan is that
I literally keep three shotters
I'm lyrically James Todd, Tariq Trotter minus the cap
I thought I heard a voice in my head that said, kill
I had no other choice that was left except fill

He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will
Yeah, I slaughter goons under the moonlight
John Wilkes, that's who I'm in the booth like
Abra-, I go ham for dead presidents
And everything I record is over your head like a boom mic
Why would you irrelevant fucks want to rebel against us
Knowing your Smith & Wesson has never been clutched?
Knowing you never been rushed by the most ignorant niggas invented
Them niggas gotta send you to the
Dentist to get a whole row of elephant tusks
Your teeth gone like you been on some meth and dust forever
I see you, my niggas call me the enemy watcher
The minute we spot ya, the semi'll pop, nigga, we got ya
I'm livin' to conquer, remember the mantra, I'm grippin' the launcher
Like Em and the Dr., with no guilty conscience
I'm still shockin' like droppin' a boombox in bathwater
More shockin' than a pissed off Blanka
I just finished fuckin' a fish called Wanda
I'm finna wander off into yonder
Beyond just mentally stronger, memory monster
I remember the sponsorin' thought that conquered his triple entendre
You the cross of a unicorn and The Unabomber
Quit horsin' around in this building or you a goner
Your Willy Wonka persona won't help you any longer
I'm Optimus, I make prime examples of mini-Tonkas
Hogtie your squad and go bonkers
Spin, grab Denaun's guitar and Honky Tonk ya
Oh, your boss on par like good golfers?
I put a hole in one of you birdies with this Eagle and launch it (pew)
I thought I heard a voice in my head that said, kill

He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will
Now this will probably be the illest most shit that I've ever said
God bless the dead and let Biggie possess the pencil lead
They called me a sped and said that I had a messed up head
'Cause I said motherfuck school and instead went to special ed
Sippin' Bacardi and lime I start to recollect on the time
That I startled my mom and had her scared to death
Word to Method Man
She heard some Wu-Tang coming from towards the patio
She was like, what the heck was that?
She went to check on the noise and go inspect the deck
Then I jumped out with a sword and yelled, protect your neck
Now bow to the Lord, hold up, no, better yet, kneel
Better yet, get down on all fours and take a vow to always
Rejoice in the sound of my voice, bitch, you don't have a choice
Just a third of my will will overpower yours
Using about a fourth to create the amount of force
It'll take to knock out a horse like a tranq' full of Tylen-, or
Enter my house of whores with a thousand floors
Got a crown of thorns, but it won't fit around the horns
But I'ma keep it a buck like a dollar store
I'm more than you bargained for and I am far more worse
Than a fourty-some bar Lord Jamal verse
Nothing means more than respect, so when I curse
You could say I swore to protect
My image, I have zero time or regard for
A never was, been claiming rap when it's not yours
If it was anyone's house G Rap and
Rakim would be havin' you mop floors
Run-DMC would be havin' you cleanin' sinks
Yeah, your group was off the chain, but you were the weakest link
Rest of these youngins of mine
Time to start throwing some shade, this time I'm shutting the blinds
'Cause when I'm looking at y'all, shit, it's no wonder it's why
I need a visor, 'cause y'all are just suns in my eyes
Born a cynic and more demented than
An orphanage with a morgue up in it
Next door to an abortion clinic
Newborn infants tortured and tormented
With their foreheads dented when they drop 'cause the floor's cemented
Their corpses get ornamented
The coroner with a storage bin rented
To store them in, and the torsos of forty women reported missin'
Distorted, twisted, this isn't no storybook ending
This is only the beginning
So Lord forgive me, I'm hearing voices
I can't ignore them anymore, they're winning
I thought I heard a voice in my head that said, kill
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil

Put his foot through it and crawl in it like a tunnel

19 shots might seem like a lot, but it's not
I ain't even buzzin', man, I swear to God (brrrr)
Tom, stop, you're gonna scare the dog
He's gonna bark and Mr. Johnson's gonna come downstairs, and, ugh

Go have another fuckin' heart attack, you old fart

""Sorry, I had to shit, dude, where's the tissue?""

Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies, right now, we're falling like the rain
So let the river run
He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jetpack
She's kept track of all his internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife-in-hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately, says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy
To spite her man, and I know she's using me to try to play him
I don't care, ""Hi, Suzanne,"" but I should've said ""Bye, Suzanne""
After the first night, but tonight I am
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth in my lies, now we're falling like the rain
So let the river run
One-night stand turned to two-night stand
It was, ""Come sunlight, scram,"" now we hug tight, and
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's irreversible
I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you, I don't want you
Took advantage of my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, should've knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit, fuck!
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth in my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
My name's (oh), my name's (oh)
River (oh), watch, river run
Call me (oh), call me (oh)
River (oh, we'll let the river run)
Always the bridesmaid, never the bride, hey
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave
I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight, but I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really would've loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie to tell our unborn child?
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me
Well, little one (I'm sorry), I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)

I am the complete opposite of these retards who spit these weak bars
I'ma leave carnage
Each thought'll be so toxic, it'll block the wind through your esophagus
Stop it, cutting off your oxygen
And I hit them pads like a boxing gym
Better watch for Slim, better get to popping when I'm at the top again
I won't topple and I'm giving it to anyone who wanna come and get it
And I'm not gonna stop
But when they ask me is the war finished with MGK? Of course it is
I cleansed him of his mortal sins, I'm God
And the Lord forgives even the devil worshipers
I'm moving on but you know your scruples are gone
When you're born with Lucifer's horns
And you're from the school of Notorious, Puba, Cube
And The Poor Righteous Teachers tutored my students
Showed them all the blueprint and formula
But it seems like the more they studied my music
The more they remind me of eyeballs
I'm watching my pupils get cornier (uh)

Shady like a shadow or your silhouette, intellect

Nickle-plated, twenty two, two, two

Ain't shit I won't do just to get a few YouTube views
Run up in a church like pew, pew, pew

But, even to the untrained human eye
We ain't the same, you and I
Somebody should have explained to you why
For you to go against me, it's simply insane, you will die (yeah)
That's why they call me Kamikaze, it's plain suicide, yeah
But I know magic and here go my last trick
I'm 'bout to say abracadabra and pull a B Rabbit up out of my hat
I'm about to relapse and I betcha that you won't know how to react
But a look of disgust, I don't doubt it'd be that
As I begin to fuckin' devour the track
And you backpedal that as a cowardly act
Like a Saudi attack when the towers collapse

Still, it's no excuse to abuse you
But no one knows what I'm goin' through, so I used you
To be truthful, I wouldn't know what to do if I lose you
So I refuse to, might have a screw loose and a fuse blew
But I think I might be buildin' up a tolerance to you
'Cause one minute I'm hollerin', ""Screw you""
Next I take it back, guess you can say I'm tryna unscrew you

Did you find someone new?
Are you doin' this with them?
'Cause I remember when
Still remember when you was mine, yeah
We were inseparable at one time, yeah
You know my love for you was undying, yeah
You used to always have my back
Some days it feels like you're all that I have
That's why I'm tryna hold onto you for as long as I can
And you just want me for my money, so I got you wrapped all in Saran
Damn, talk about eatin' out the palm of my hand
But if not for my financials
I wouldn't have you anyways, there have been ample
Plenty days, where I'm just in a daze and I can't pull
Myself up out this rut, and you're so much of a handful
I can only take so much of you all at one time
Because too much of you's just too much to swallow sometimes
Gotta take you in doses, but when you're not at my side
I shake in convulsions
Separation anxiety 'cause we may be the closest
Yeah, baby, we hopeless, don't we make an atrocious
Combination? We know, it's like playin' with explosives
Quite dangerous though, but my brain's in hypnosis
Such a wide range of emotions
Migraines, but why the fuck am I takin' these Motrins?
Ibuprofens, like a drop of rain in the ocean
And you're my fix on the days when I'm broken
But the shit's about to go sideways, I just know it
I'll never love again
The way I loved you
Did you find someone new?
Are you doin' this with them?
'Cause I remember when
Still remember when you was mine, yeah
We were inseparable at one time, yeah
You know my love for you was undying, yeah
You used to always have my back
So I spiral downwardly 'cause I'm too cowardly to leave you
Head is clouded in a fallacy, but in reality
Somehow it seems like when I lay me down to sleep, I'm countin' sheep
You're bound to creak
'Cause every time I turn around, you keep runnin' out on me
You're my Xanax and my Valium, I'm an addict, you're a downer
You're my habit, it's like I found you in the cabinet
But it's like I can't uncap it 'cause it's childproof
A scoundrel and fiends how I feel around you
Awful, every time I lost you, felt like I had you in my pocket
Now I'm flippin' over the furniture
Punchin' holes in the walls through
Everything that we've gone through
How many times you've fucked me?
But the way it felt for me to be on top when I was on you
Swore my fealty, but word to G-O-D

It's my alter ego's fault
These evil thoughts can be so dark
Cerebral palsy, three Zolofts
I eat, doze off to ""Rico Suave"" (look it up)
Cadillac with a ladder rack in the back, with a cracked axel
A backpack full of Paxil, a black satchel, a knapsack
And a flask full of 'gnac and Jack Daniels

I don't wanna hassle you, Alexandra
But my dick's an acronym 'cause it stands for you (stands for you, oh)

I'm goin' in like the Red Roof (Red Roof Inn)
You don't like it, eat a cock 'til your jaw breaks (yeah)
Call it caught between a rock and a hard place
Like a sasquatch in a crawlspace
'Cause you're watchin' your heart race like you're Scarface
In a car chase with the cops or an arcade
Stuck inside of a Mario Kart race duckin' saw blades
At a stop and a start pace
What I'm tryin' to say is I'm drivin' 'em all crazy (hahaha)
I can't understand a word you say (I'm tone-deaf)

And pretend it's a five-star,"" yeah
I leap into the deep end of the pool
I can show you where the dives are (get it?) Ha
We don't even gotta drive far
I know this spot that is so live
But I'm tryna get some head first (what?)
Like a nosedive (haha)
So many side chicks
Can't decide which to slide with and which should I ditch
So when it comes to ass, bitch
I get behind like the Heimlich (get behind, yeah)
Had one chick who liked to flip sometimes on some switchin' sides shit
Pushed her out, the side kick
Then I flipped the lil' white bitch off like a light switch (bitch)
It's okay not to like my shit
Everything's fine, drink your wine, bitch
And get offline, quit whinin', this is just a rhyme, bitch (rhyme, bitch)
But ask me will I stick to my guns (guns) like adhesive tape? (Adhesive tape)
Does Bill Cosby sedate once he treats to cheesecake and a decent steak? (Huh?)
You think gettin' rid of me's a piece of cake?
I'm harder than findin' Harvey Weinstein a date (damn)
And that's why they say I got more lines than Black Friday
So save that shit for the damn library (shh)
You heard of Kris Kristofferson? (Yeah)

I ever let you cocksuckers eat at me

Bein' dirt poor to filthy rich, I'm still me, bitch
Like a realtor, that's real tea, bitch (real talk)

Here comes Barshall with no holds barred

Like your old broad, she full of semen, like the coast guard (haha)
And life's been pretty good to me so far (yeah), for the most part
Had a couple of run-ins with popo, caught
A couple assault charges, got a few priors like crowbars (priors)
Which is so odd 'cause I'm 48 now
That 5-0's startin' to creep up on me like a patrol car (woo)
I'll be an old fart, but you don't want no part, so, bitch, don't start (don't start)
Simmer down, compose yourself, Mozart

And if time is money, you have no clocks
And any folk caught within close proximity's gettin' cold-cocked
My enemies, I'm a chimney, give me the smoke, opps

Miss, you ovulating? Wait, I didn't mean to
Piss you off, my lady, what I really meant to say is
It goes a little something like this
Soon as I'm through with the Unisom I'ma hit the snooze alarm
Before I lose my mind, who am I gonna use it on?
Utilizing this tool, I will execute a line
Like what I tried to do one time in my youth when I euthanized
My poodle in junior high, used to hide in my room and fly
To the moon and try suicide with the glue from my school supplies
Then Proof, Denaun
Eye-Kyu and I would climb in that hooptie to ride to Drew's and rhyme
Bodied Saint Andrew's Hall too many times to count
Before I tear up The Shelter, give my dawgs a pound
Now I'm 'bout to treat all of you rappers noggins how
Dre does every time he goes back to Compton now
'Cause every so often I'll visit my old stomping grounds

Day is night now, in is out, black is white

No means yes, but yes don't mean no

Just flew the coop, the cops are in hot pursuit

And quash the feud with him and Ja and Ja'll actually spit a bar
That's not from a Dr. Seuss book and they'll start a group (haha)

""I was you,"" but, like, ah, fuck you (man)
Long as I got these walls and these hallways I'm always
Have someone to argue with

No life jacket, man, I had like six psychiatrists, scientists
Misdiagnose me with plaque psoriasis 'cause I asked 'em, ""Why is it
My eye itches?"" so they gave me some diet tips
And Viagra with side effects, I might end up growing spiderwebs
In my head and dying a horrifying death, on my final breath
I will tell you, apply your lips to my dick, it's one size that fits

I can do it and do it, when I'm tryin' to
When my records flop they still go through the roof

Who was on their grind, to get money moves
And you ain't gon' get that if you want it down
You gotta take shots with 100 proof
Been in survival mode
Since a five year old, it was I alone
Since my trike was stole, spiral notebook and microphone
But lookin' back how bad it was then
If it hadn't been for the pad and the pen
Addict mom and deadbeat dad
I wouldn't have the savage within
Havin' to win, every single battle I'm in
All I ever wanted was to be an MC
Tediously I wrote obediently, believing in me
EPMD must've had teachin' degrees
Learn to defeat enemies with the ink, thinkin' of these rhymes
Would be as easy as eatin' graffiti
Would be like remedial readin' to me (yeah)

The moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and four murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady!
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
O-oh, o-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk
(Okay, let's go)
Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick from unda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto

And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk
(Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre)
They see that low rider go by, they're like, ""Oh my!""
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick, 'cause I know why
I dip through in that Six-Trey, like, ""Sick 'em, Dre!""
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love L.A.
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Drivin' 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado?
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?

It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thang when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marijuan', do what you want
Nigga, on and on, 'til the break of what?
Get the paper, man, I'm cakin', you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothin'
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown
Motherfucker, I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick?
Fat-ass Birkin bags, some classy shit
Jimmy Choo shoes; I say, ""Move"", a bitch move
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of 'em got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I notice there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn

Like music's my first love, right
But, what it turned into is like
You know these, these cats got it now, she just like a hoe
(They ain't doin' it now to make music)
Yeah, for real, yeah, yeah
Switched it up then everybody
Done changed the shit on that damn-
Yeah, e'rybody done ran through it
Mumble rappin'
Ain't no more substance in shit
Right, right
They don't treat it the way it needs to be treated
I kinda want that old thing back
Yeah, I was young, I was hungry
I was chasing the bag at 21
I was lucky
To find an uneaten fucking honeybun (what?) I forgot about
Now I got money falling out, fifties, hundreds and twenties
And I know nothing is funny 'bout the Manchester bombing
But we got something in common, both of us are alarmin' (what?)
Foul, disgusting, and awful (yeah), so repugnant and ugly (yup)
I could give the Boston Marathon a run for its money, yeah
And you could say I'm a little bit immature
But this type of literature got me a little richer, haha
But I get insecure when them other dudes hit on you, girl
You're letting 'em fiddle with your clitoris
Remember you were my fucking-
You used to be my favorite, bitch
Things'll never be the same ain't it funny how you changed
Up and flipped the script?
You done let a bunch of lames fall through
And complain that I can't permit
You ain't have to do it like that
Told you I'll be right back
Look what you did, I need a new chick
Like the music, I had to bounce on my favorite bitch
Always hated my smile
Mama told me it's goofy
I'd get picked on at school
Come home and she'd school me
She never sugarcoated it to me
She said if I wasn't so stupid and ugly
I wouldn't always get bullied (true)
I think of my struggles (yeah) and get emotional
Could be 'cause how behind the eight-ball
And far in the hole that they put me
Now I'm on a roll like a Tootsie (yeah)
I'm just trollin' you pussies
But I'm like stroller 'cause you'll see
Just how I roll if you push me (haha)
But that's what I do this music for
When I was goin' through some of the hardest times I drew from her
But she's like the devil because I can't just let loose of her
Plus the thought of losing her
Makes me wanna just let loose on her
Then I hit the studio, tryna rendezvous with her
Tell her, ""It's a butt-dial girl, yeah, booty-call"" (haha)
That's how it used to be
'Cause you and me, we ruled the world
And we made Curtis blow (50)
Fuck, I miss them days
You used to be my favorite, bitch
Things'll never be the same ain't it funny how you changed
Up and flipped the script?
You done let a bunch of lames fall through
And complain that I can't permit
You ain't have to do it like that
Told you I'll be right back
Look what you did, I need a new chick
Like the music I had to bounce on my favorite bitch
You fuckin' leavin' me bitch?
I don't think so, sit your motherfuckin' ass down
I swear to God, you run to that door
I'ma put one in the back of your fucking head
I'ma ask you this one time
The answer better be yes
Would you marry me again?
Now that everything is changed (yeah)
It'll never be the same (nah)
As the era whens we came (who?)
From Nas to Pac, Rak' (yeah), Eric B. and Kane (I know)
But I know a few from this era that are lyrically insane
And although most are never gonna hit the level Cole or Weezy at
Or be emotionally attached to Yo! MTV Raps (yeah)
Runnin' home from school to catch an episode
The feeling that it gave you to rip the plastic off the tape
You hold and peel it back, yeah
Tear it off and play it (what?)
Swear to God, 4 o'clock
We crowd around the TV butter in his underwear and socks
When Nani was Kon Artis (yeah)
And Proof had his hair in locs (Doody)
Yeah, back when Flavor Flav had us wearing clocks
Back with Ed Lover (yeah)
When there was two Dr. Dre's, that's a paradox (pair of Docs)
But I never thought I'd get so jealous
At the thought of letting you go psychologically
It's gonna bother me, my eyes are already watery
Part of me don't wanna stop 'til I get you back
'Cause I got to put the work in and tell you I'm never givin' this up
The other part wants to tell you just to get fucked
Go back to whatever dick that you sucked (ah)
Get back together with them, you slut
Givin' up the vagina like a trip to the gynecologist
When I helped you become bigger than you were
But I guess that it slipped your mind
You must be biding your time looking for someone to come along
That'll make you feel like I did back when you were mine, huh? (Damn)
But truthfully it was never really you and me exclusively
And there's too many new MC's you can choose between
But no matter how many motherfuckers ran through
Bet they can't do it like me
But I can't keep burnin' the candle at both ends
And I can't handle it when I leave and you find another one
Now I gotta take this beat and dismantle it
I won't grieve when I kill you
But if I can't have you, bitch, nobody can

But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous, you must be a sorceress
'Cause you just did the impossible, gained my trust
Don't play games, it'd be dangerous if you fuck me over
'Cause if I get burnt, I'ma show ya what it's like to hurt
'Cause I've been treated like dirt befo' ya
And love is evol, spell it backwards, I'll show ya
Nobody knows me, I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever, so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these mo'fuckin' ho's
Blood suckin' succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be
Like tryin' to start over
I've got a hole in my heart for some kind of emotional roller coaster
Somethin' I won't go on, so you toy with my emotions, ho, it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, I wasn't jokin' when I told ya
You take my breath away, you're a supernova and I'm a
I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250, 000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you, right at you
I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't with you I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we thinks
Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em, it's never the same?
You want 'em when they don't want you
Soon as they do, feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't lookin' when I stumbled onto you, musta been fate
But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take?
Let's cut to the chase
'Fore the door shuts in your face, promise me if I cave in and break
And leave myself open that I won't be makin' a mistake
'Cause I'm a
I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250, 000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you, right at you
So after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I'll pour my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin', I'm tryin' to stop you from leavin'
You won't even listen so fuck it, I'm tryin' to stop you from breathin'
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you, squeezin'
Till I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick
Ain't a possible reason I can think of
To let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks, then I let you go and just give
And before I put that gun to my temple, I told you this
And I would've did anything for you to show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, it's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cause I'm a
I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you

It's like pneumonia symptoms and contracting COVID instantly
Which is what separates my flow from theirs
So that no one gets even close to this to pose a risk to me
So vocalistically (what?), that's social distancing (yeah)
Flow going viral, you best stay strapped
With that Lysol and get way back (shh)
Get that Pine-Sol and that Ajax
'Cause this dry cough is just like football umpires callin' a playback
Bitch, back the fuck up like 15 yards
These rhymes call for a face mask (face mask)
'Nother 14-day quarantine, they're cordoning off everything

I got a contact like eyewear (whoa)
Wait a minute, bitch, let me lie here (uh)
Every year, you drop the ball like Times Square
My hair trigger whenever I get an idea's
Like, fuck, now my name rings out like a sponge mop
And my drip was a drop
In the bucket, so that gun shot
You just heard just now in that one spot
Just came from the nine mil' that I just got
That's big bucks and I got a full money clip and I'm loaded
I ain't even mean to go the fuck off
And I'm still totally inappropriate with an opiate
Groping it while I'm holding it like a trophy
I'm hoping a little codeine'll get me OD'in'
Whoa, everything is slow, I begin to floating
I know that I'm getting loaded, the pen exploded
Hiroshima with the flows, a utopia
With the dope, I'm an OG, I'm like the G.O.A.T.
Here to get your goat little bit of sodium, it's assault
When I'm at the podium, at your throat, holy camoly
I'm in the zone with the shit I'm on
Get Imodium and a commode because nobody's even close
You're petroleum to plutonium, you're a phony
I'm at the crib with your ho
Got her at the pole like voting with no clothing
Stripped down to a toe ring and here we go with the gloating
I've got my nose in the air like a Boeing
Then I got into a little bit of an argument with her
So I took a little lick of a Klonopin at dinner
Then I hit her with the motherfucking ottoman and bit her
Then I shot her in the liver, delivered her to the bottom of the river (dope)
But I'm probably gon' jump in the water with her
With a wad of money 'cause I got a lot of it
And when it come to drippin', I be soppin' like a hundred mile an hour
Never runnin' out of either one of 'em, I gotta get it 'cause

It's been weeks since I saw your outline

This is what losing hope might sound like
Put me down so I'm in my place
Say it's over for breathing space
All I was, was a route to change
Is this just growing up?
I might seem too distracted right now
It's been so long I've been the punchline
I stand naked while these clothes dry out
Leave me drowning to edit the runtime

Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die
♪
I can hear the drummer drumming
And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone, I know somethin's coming
But I'm runnin' from it to be standing at the summit
And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was
Was it, too good to be true?
Have nothin', get it all but too much of it
Then lose it again, did I swallow hallucinogens
Cause if not, where the hell did it go?
Cause here I sit in Lucifer's den by the dutch oven
Just choosing to sin
Even if it means I'm sellin' my soul, just to be the undisputed again
Do whatever I gotta do just to win
Cause I got this motherfuckin' cloud over my head
Crown around it, thorns on it
Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't think I'd be back, did ya?
How 'bout that, I'm somehow now back to the underdog
But no matter how loud that I bark, this sport is somethin' I never bow-out at
I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate
But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt
Even when you bitches are countin' me out, and I appear to be down for the count
Only time I ever been out and about
Is drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt
Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here but I'm not a quitter
Gotta get up, give it all I got or give up
Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept goin'
I'm tryna be headstrong but it feels like I slept on my neck wrong
Cause you're moving onto the next, but is the respect gone?
Cause someone told me that

Don't give me that sob story liar, don't preach to the choir
You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep
Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer
Wouldn't even take shit into consideration
Obliterate anyone in the way
I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to show out on a track with me
But it'd actually have to be a fuckin' blow-out to get me to re-tire
Tell these new artists that kings never die
Did it just say I've been upstaged?
Why am I online? It's driving me crazy
I'm ridin' shotgun tryna get a gauge
On what's hot, but I'm not one to conform
But as days pass in this shit
And opinions sway, I can hear 'em say
If I stay passionate maybe I can stage a miraculous
Comeback as if I went away
But detractors just say so much for the Renegade
Someone's gonna make me blow my composure
Here I go again, center stage and I feel like I'm in a cage
They so want a champion to fall
It's no wonder why I laugh at 'em, cause why can't we win 'em all?
So fuck what these cynics say
(It) just goes ta show that when my back's against the wall
And I'm under a tack again, that I'll act as if I'm 'posed ta
With this pent up rage, cause all these plaques in my office
On the floor stacked against the door
Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again?
Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards
And trophies just don't mean jack anymore
If I'm here today and gone tomorrow
And I'm not gonna be
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die
I want it, I'm comin' to get it
So you son of a bitches don't duck you're gonna get Riddick Bowe'd
Critics'll end up in critical, think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked
And I'm not stopping 'til I'm on top again, all alone and on a throne
Like a token of respect, or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed
Tossed in the air by my own arm, and launched so hard it broke my collarbone
And when it's my time to go, I'm still not leaving
Stop for no one, I don't know but I've been told an obstacle that
Blocks your road, knock it over, time to go for that pot of gold, cause
They say kings never die
Just ask Jam Master Jay
They just grow wings and they fly
So, hands up, reach for the sky
Try to hold and prolong these moments
Cause in a blink of an eye
They'll be over
Tryna secure your legacy like Shakur
And ensure nobody's ever gonna be what you were
So before you're leavin' this Earth
You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral berserk
Deacon of words, syllable genius at work
Plus I'm thinkin' that they're mistakin' my kindness for weakness, kill 'em with meanness
I went from powdered milk and Farina
To flippin' burgers on the grill for some peanuts
From Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas, still appeal to the dreamers
I made it to the silverscreen but Rocky's still what the theme is
Khalil on the beat cause makin' the beat ain't the same feelin' to me as killin' the beat is
Or fulfillin' to me is what fillin' a seat is
It's that ""Sound Bombing"" Thirstin' Howl
Common, underground, Diamond D, Outsidaz
Stomach growl, throbbin' hunger, out-rhymin' everyone
God just give me one shot, I swear that I won't let you down
I'ma be around forever-and-a-day, even in the ground
You ain't never ever gonna hear 'em say I ain't
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone

You’re Never Over,Curtain Call 2,https://open.spotify.com/album/3aTuW4BtsyyyyQa9LKqj8n,2022,54349989,"The days are cold, living without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days of old, thinking about you
You may be gone, but you're never over
If Proof could see me now, I know he'd be proud
Somewhere in me deep down, there's something in me he found
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now
You try, it'll be them doors on Dre's Phantom, believe me clowns
That means ""suicide"" homie, you'll never throw me
Off of this course, blow me! Bitch, I do this all for the sport only
But I want it all, I'm not just talking awards, homie
And the ball's in my court and it's lonely on top of the world
When you're the only one with the balls in your shorts
To leave their jaws on the floors with no re-morse
Remember that when they get to dogging you boy, homie
So y'all can just get to blogging about bologna, I'm not gonna stop
The saga continue, no stopping the force Obi, I'm mopping the floors
With them, I keep trying pass it, but they keep on dropping the torch
And it won't be long till this sport is O-V-E-R
Just Blaze and me we are knocking on doors and no we
Ain't pumpkins on Halloween but we'll show up on your porch, so be
Careful what you say, there ain't no punks over here so follow me
Through the fog like I'm S-N-double-O-P
Let me guide you through the smoke G
If only I wasn't traveling down this road by my lonely
No one who knew me like you will ever know me
I don't think you understand how much you meant to me
The days are cold, living without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days of old, thinking about you

For you, I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
So sick it'll blow up the mic, It'll put the ""dyna"" in mite
Yeah it'll make the dopest MC wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself
Tap dancing all over the beat, it'll jump off the page and spit itself
Yeah it's the best thing I could do right now Doody for you is to rep'
So I'm gonna fuck till I die, yeah I'ma do it to death
And instead of mourning your death, I'd rather celebrate your life
Elevate to new height, step on the gas and accelerate, I'mma need 2 mics
'Cause the way that I'm feeling tonight, everything I can just do right
There's nothing that I can do wrong, I'm too strong and I'm just too hyped
Just finished the rhyme and bust it, and - excuse the corny metaphor but
They'll never catch up to all this energy that I've mustered
So God just help me out while I fight through this grieving process
Tryna process this loss is making me nauseous
But this depression ain't taking me hostage
I've been patiently watching this game, pacing these hallways
You had faith in me always
Proof you knew I'd come out of this slump, rise from these ashes
Come right back on they asses, and go Mike Tyson on these bastards
And I'ma show them, blow them out the water slaughter them homes
I'ma own so many belts, the only place they can hit me is below them
Homie I know I'm never gonna be the same without you
I never would've came in this game, I'm going insane without you
Matter of fact it was just the other night, had another dream about you
You told me to get up, I got up I spread my wings and I flew
You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you
You told me ""Naw, Doody you're not!"" Laying on that table, I knew
I was gonna make it, soon as you said ""Think of Hailie"", I knew
There wasn't no way that I was ever gonna leave them babies, and Proof
Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you
Lord I'm so thankful, please don't think that I don't feel grateful, I do
Just grant me the strength that I need, for one more day to get through
So homie this is your song, I dedicate this to you
I love you Doody

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off of love, drunk from my hate, it's like I'm huffin' paint
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it
""Wait! Where you goin'?"" ""I'm leavin' you""
""No, you ain't, come back,"" we're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"" I don't even know his name

You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say, yeah, best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know you 'cause today, that was yesterday
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her next time, you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it windowpane

Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
And we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is
You're the same as me, when it comes to love, you're just as blinded
""Baby, please come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me""
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away
""Wait up, come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk""
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
""Next time? There will be no next time""
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back
I know I'm a liar, if she ever tries to fuckin' leave again
I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?

Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'
Into ya, the back of it just mangled steel my Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi (Gandhi)
Translation, I will probably kill us both when I end up backin' into ya
You ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to ya
When you're bit with the
Venom, adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em (w-w-when they get bit with the)
Venom (I got that), adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em (w-w-when they get bit with the)
I said knock-knock, let the devil in
Alien, E-E-Elliott phone home, ain't no tellin' when this chokehold
On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a Symbiote, so, my fangs are in your throat, ho
You're snake-bitten with my venom
With the ballpoint pen I'm
Gun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot
Tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots
Fired up and caught fire, juggernaut, punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock, why the fuck not? You only get one shot
Ate shit 'til I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor, then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
And awake with a headache, and I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to 'cause they're chasin' me, but I'm part of you
So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like a parasite
And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too 'cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the super villain dad and mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you, and I'm the suit, so call me
Venom (I got that), adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em (w-w-when they get bit with the)
Venom (I got that), adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm

Cadillac Sevilles, Coupe De Villes
Brain dead rims, yeah, stupid wheels
Girl, I'm too for real, lose your tooth and nails
Try to fight it, try to deny it
Stupid you will feel, what I do, I do at will
Shooting from the hip, yeah boy shoot to kill
Half a breath left on my death bed
Screaming F that yeah super Ill
Baby, what the deal, we can chill
Split half a pill and a happy meal, fuck a stank slut
I cut my toes off and step on the receipt before I foot the bill
Listen garden tool don't me introduce you to my power tool
You know the fucking drill
How you douche bags feel knowing you're disposable?
Summers eve Massengill
Shady's got the mass appeal, baby, crank the shit
'Cause it's your God damn jam
You say that you want your punchlines a little more compact
Well, shawty, I'm that man
These other cats ain't metaphorically where I'm at man
I gave Bruce Wayne a Valium and said
Settle ya fuckin ass down I'm ready for combat, man
Get it calm Batman?

Betcha that you'll never guess who's knocking at your door
People hit the floors
Yeah, tonight ladies, you gon get divorced
Girl, forget remorse, I'ma hit you broads with
Chris's force like you pissed him off
Talented with the tongue muthfucker
You ain't gotta lick in yours
Hittin' licks like I'm robbin' liquor stores
Makin' cash registers shit their draws
Think you spit the raw, I'm an uncut slab of beef
Laying on your kitchen floor

Bring me two extension chords

Fuck, my dick's big, bitch
Need I remind you that I don't need the fucking swine flu
To be a sick pig

Does Lil Wayne slurps syrup 'til he burps and smokes purp?
Does a word search gets circles wrapped around it like
You do when I come through, I'd like you to remind yourself
Of what the fuck I can do when I'm on the mic
Or your the kind of girl that I can take a liking to
Psych I'm spiking you like a football
Been this way since I've stood a foot tall
You're a good catch with a shitty spouse
Pretty mouth and a good jaw
Gimme good brain
Watch the wood grain, don't want no cum stain
Bitch, you listening tryna' turn me down
Slut I'm talking to you, turn me back up
Are you insane tryna talk over me in the car
Shut the fuck up while my shits playin'
I'ma shit stain on the underwear of life
What's the saying? Where there's thunder there's lightening
And they say that it never strikes twice in the same place
Then how the fuck have I been hit six times
In three different locations on four separate ocassions?
And you can bet your stanking ass
That I've come to smash everything in my path
Fork was in the road took the pyschopath
Poison ivy wouldn't have me thinking rash
So hit the dance floor, cutie
While I do my duty on this microphone
Shake your booty shawty I'm the shit
Why you think Proof used to call me Doodi

You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard

Walk On Water (feat. Beyoncé),Curtain Call 2,https://open.spotify.com/album/3aTuW4BtsyyyyQa9LKqj8n,2022,183448286,"I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (fuck)
Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can't reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark's high, butter–
Flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because—
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
(It's the curse of the— it's the curse of the—)
I walk on water (Shit)
But only when it freezes
It's the curse of the standard
That the first of the Mathers discs set
Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
I've garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin' the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, ""This shit is garbage!""
God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it's exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith
And I'm not Prince, so...
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
(It's true, I'm a Rubik's— it's true—)
But only when it freezes
(It's true—)
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
It's true, I'm a Rubik's—a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex–
Pectations and meet 'em, but first
The ""Speedom"" verse, now Big Sean
He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares
Or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta site, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause—
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown
'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike
