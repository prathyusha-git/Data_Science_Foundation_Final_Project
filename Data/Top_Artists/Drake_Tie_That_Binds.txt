Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Kill me slowly with those piercing eyes
Don't break my fall
Hiding from those stars, foreign inside
Every time, I know you're here
I never felt so alive (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Slowly you're pulling me 'cross the line
In no time, in no time
Ayy
Oh, baby, I'm feeling all sort of things
I never wanna see you ever leave
Maybe I'll take you to my family
Change your name
Oh, baby
♪
With no doubt, I'll give you all my time
And walk the line
You bring out the best part of me, babe
Effortlessly, effortlessly
Hope you never dim the light (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Hold me close as you can 'til we're ghost
It's a promise, 'til we're ghost
Ayy
Oh, baby, I'm feeling all sort of things
I never wanna see you ever leave
Maybe I'll take you to my family
Change your name
Oh, baby
Please, don't leave me
You know I need you, you know I need you, yeah
