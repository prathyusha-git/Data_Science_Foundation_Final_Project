Sycamore in the summer, bearing leaves
Swing, you're pushing our daughter underneath
Flowers bloom in the garden, sway in breeze
Just imagine a world where we could be
Right now, in the waiting room, emotions running wild
Worried 'bout my lover, and I'm worried 'bout our child
Part of me was always in denial
It's gonna take a little while
But in our story, love in, love out
And we are glorious
But in our story, love in, love out
And we are glorious
Sycamore bringing shade from beating sun
Nothing more than a word, a smoking gun
What a puzzle is this to be in love
To be planting your roots, then dig them up
Waiting on professionals to tell you how it is
What's he gonna say after "I think you better sit"?
Brace yourself, something's about to hit
It's gonna take a little while
But in our story, love in, love out
And we are glorious
But in our story, love in, love out
And we are glorious
But in our story, love in, love out
And we are glorious
But in our story, love in, love out
And we are glorious
Sycamore in the field, a lonely tree
Darling, what will become of you and me?
