Thirty-eight dollars for a coconut rum
You never looked prettier sippin' on one
These downtown lights are turnin' back off
'Cause the world is turnin' back on, um, um
On the same damn road we drove a thousand times
I swear I saw a message in them white and yellow lines
And I ain't sayin' I'm a killer or if I'll ever be
But hypothetically
Would you hide my gun? Would you tell no one?
Would you pack a never comin' back again bag?
If the three-times-four's bangin' at our door
Would you stall and let me slip out the back?
Girl, if you wanted to, could you get to runnin' to
That never-endin'-honeymoon Mexico sun?
'Cause you know I adore ya, no shit, I'd kill a man for ya
And if I did, would you hide my gun?
Would you hide my gun?
If you had to dig a hole, would you take it to the grave?
Put some concrete shoes at the bottom of a lake
If I shot him dead, would you shoot me straight?
Yeah, shoot me straight
Would you hide my gun? Would you tell no one?
Would you pack a never comin' back again bag?
If the three-times-four's bangin' at our door
Would you stall and let me slip out the back?
Girl, if you wanted to, could you get to runnin' to
A never-endin'-honeymoon, Mexico sun?
'Cause you know I adore ya, no shit, I'd kill a man for ya
And if I did, would you hide my gun?
Would you hide my gun?
A big wheel gun in my right hand, tiny diamond in my left
Are you down to go the distance, Lord, in sickness and in health?
'Cause nothin' gonna part us, not even death
Would you hide my gun? Would you tell no one?
Would you pack a never comin' back again bag?
If the three-times-four's bangin' at our door
Would you stall and let me slip out the back?
Girl, if you wanted to, could you get to runnin' to
That never-endin'-honeymoon Mexico sun?
'Cause you know I adore ya, no shit, I'd kill a man for ya
And if I did, would you hide my gun?
Would you hide my gun?
Lord, I didn't do anything wrong
I'm only askin' just because
