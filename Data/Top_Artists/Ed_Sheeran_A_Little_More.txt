You think I was born to ruin your life
But you did most of that before I arrived
Some things are broken when you open the box
So stop this, you've come too far, enough is enough
I wish I didn't care this much, but I do
No one knows the half of it, what you put me through
And I, I sometimes wonder, do you live with regret
Wish I could say I wish you the best
'Cause I used to love you
Now every day I hate you just a little more
Life got better when I lost you
But every day, I hate you just a little more and more, and more
Blame it on your history and say it's not your fault
I can't call you crazy, cause you could be diagnosed
So I used to love you, but every day I
Hate you just a little more, more, more
I wish that you would look in the mirror, 'cause if you did
You see the problem is you 'cause you're a prick
I know that I'm your scapegoat whenever the rain falls
Whenever you slip or when you're in a dip
I was there to lean on when I was a kid
But now that I'm an adult, I see it for what it is
I have to lock the door now, fuck building a bridge
Take all your apologies and put them in the bin
For your dad's sake, please move out your dad's place
Stop bringing drama there with your mates
Your sister's got enough to manage on her plate
To worry about you controlling your rage
One day we all be dead
But between now and then
I never want to see you again
I used to love you
Now every day I hate you just a little more
Life got better when I lost you
But every day, I hate you just a little more
And more and more
Blame it on your history and say it's not your fault
I can't call you crazy 'cause you could be diagnosed
So I used to love you, but every day I hate you just a little more
And more and more
I wish I didn't care this much, but I do
No one knows the half of it what you put me through
And I, I sometimes wonder, do you live with regret
Wish I could say I wish you the best
But I don't
I used to love you
Now every day I hate you just a little more
Life got better when I lost you
But every day, I hate you just a little more
And more, and more
Blame it on your history and say it's not your fault
I can't call you crazy, cause you could be diagnosed
Ooh, I used to love you, but every day I hate you just a little more
More, more
