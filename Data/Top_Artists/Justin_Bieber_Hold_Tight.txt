That hold on tight
Yeah, that hold on tight, ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go (lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go, oh)
Hold on tight (that hold on tight)
Yeah, hold on tight (that hold on tight)
Ooh, that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Don't let this go to your head
But you're the best I've ever had
Not to mention that thing is swollen
You got me oh so in a trance
Something like a ziplock, but a lip lock
Want you wrapped around my arm like a wristwatch
Oh, so hard walking out
Got me stuck like Krazy Glue, ooh
That hold on tight
Yeah, that hold on tight, ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go (lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh)
Hold on tight (that hold on tight)
Yeah, hold on tight (that hold on tight)
Ooh, that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Got me tossing turning in the bed
Your place is where I'd rather be instead
You don't know your strength
Missing you is like adrenaline
Ooh, when you got me in a gridlock, what a great spot
With a turned up kind of loving, it just won't stop
No, so hard walking out
Got me stuck like Krazy Glue, ooh-wee
That hold on tight
Yeah, that hold on tight, ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go (lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh)
Hold on tight (that hold on tight)
Yeah, hold on tight (that hold on tight)
Ooh, that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Oh baby, holding back the faces I would make
I'm a fan, and you're the rock star, making it hard on me
Visualise a monster, 'cause you're too bad for me
Shot that arrow I'm hit, need you right near me
I try to maintain
So don't mind if I turn away, no no
I try to maintain
So don't mind if I turn away, ooh
That hold on tight
Yeah, that hold on tight, ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go (lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go, oh)
Hold on tight (that hold on tight)
Yeah, hold on tight (that hold on tight)
