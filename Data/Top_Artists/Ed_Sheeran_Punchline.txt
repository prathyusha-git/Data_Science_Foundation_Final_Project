I can't help but be destructive right now
It's been weeks since I saw your outline
In my room is a silence so loud
This is what losing hope might sound like
Put me down so I'm in my place
Say it's over for breathing space
All I was, was a route to change
Is this just growing up?
I might seem too distracted right now
It's been so long I've been the punchline
I stand naked while these clothes dry out
Leave me drowning to edit the runtime
Put me down so I'm in my place
Say it's over for breathing space
All I was, was a route to change
Is this just growing up?
All this love cannot seal my fate
Low is all that I've been of late
Caught in webs I wove with my mistakes
But this is growing up
I can't help it, but I love you so, I can't take this letting go
I still feel that we could work it out or something
All I am is only flesh and bone, why's your heart so freezing cold?
Don't you leave your weight on me, on me (hey)
I can't help it, but I love you so, I can't take this letting go
I still feel that we could work it out or something
All I am is only flesh and bone, why's your heart so freezing cold?
Don't you leave your weight on me, on me (no, I can't help it, no)
I can't help it, but I love you so (no, I can't help it, no)
I can't take this letting go (I will never let you go)
I still feel that we could (I will never let you go)
Work it out or something (no, I can't help it, no)
All I am is only flesh and bone (no, I can't help it, no)
Why's your heart so freezing cold? (I will never let you go)
Don't you leave your weight on me, on me (I will never let you go)
