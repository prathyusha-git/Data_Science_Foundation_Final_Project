I didn't mean to end his life
I know it wasn't right
I can't even sleep at night
I can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight
I end up behind bars
What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry
'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Could've been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big old crowd
Oh why, oh why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
It's a 22, I call her Peggy Sue
When she fits right down in my shoes
What do you expect me to do
If you're playin' me for a fool
I will lose my cool
And reach for my firearm
I didn't mean to lay him down
But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking
Now he's no longer living
So I'm 'bout to leave town
Yeah
'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Could've been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big old crowd
Oh why, oh why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down (well hear me now)
In central station
Look I never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it
Oh, Gosh
What ever happened to me?
Ever happened to me?
Ever happened to me?
Why did I pull the trigger?
Pull the trigger, pull the trigger, boom
And end a nigga, end a nigga life so soon
When me pull the trigger, pull the trigger, pull it on you
Somebody tell me what I'm gonna, what I'm gonna do
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Me say one man down
Oh, let me say
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
When me went downtown
'Cause now I'm a criminal, criminal, criminal
Oh Lord, oh, mercy now, I am a criminal
Man down
Tell the judge please give me minimal
Run out of town
None of them can see me now, see me now
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big old crowd
Oh why, oh why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
