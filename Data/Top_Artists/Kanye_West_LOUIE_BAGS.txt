Ain't no limit with this paper, mm
Master P, I'll have you sayin', "Mm"
Keep it unless Virgil made it, mm
Just thinkin' 'bout it make me hate it, mm
I'm not gonna lie, I couldn't move
Couldn't even if I wanted to
Imagine if the same thing haunted you
I lost my twin and my mother too
What you look like in that nasty Louis bag?
Virgil ain't even make that color, fool
What you look like in that nasty Louis bag?

I'm my lil' cousin's favorite cousin
I gave 'em all my number and my phone ain't stopped buzzin'
They listen to my songs and say their parents hate the cussin'
They asked if I was nervous on TV or if I wasn't
They asked me if it's true that I don't go to church
"My daddy said you don't", well, then I guess you know
I been thinkin' about goin', though, I might let you know
One day, I'll bring you to my concert if they let you go
Pumpin' gas alone at Texaco, hopin' I don't get approached
Don't know if it's clear until I check the coast
All these rappers dyin', I don't wan' be one that's next to go
Paranoia tickin' in my head just like a metronome
I can't walk around like Jack that wore the spectacles
I shook the hands, took the pictures, made myself accessible
Threw the parties, showed love, kept it all respectable
Tried to give you something you ain't had before, but
It's all over, they got the drop on my life, it's all over
All this pressure on me, they'd wish I'd fall over
Too bad I'm a winner like fall over
I dropped, uh, heat in February, cocky tweets in February
All-Star weekend with the court-side seats in February
I'm the champ', you come second like the E in February
All that humble sh- was fake, now, can we keep it legendary, please

It's funny how they ain't believe the hymn
Actin' like they never needed Him
Squares in your circle, out of shape, they need a gym
They pollutin' the airwaves, I'm not tryin' to breathe it in
I need fresh air
I'm in Cuba, ain't no press here, yeah
And she won't have to second-guess here
If I'm here, you gon' always be the second best here
And she gon' fit me like fresh Airs, yeah
Why you worried 'bout the next pair?
She gon' use the Nair, what hair?
Niggas fresh as him, what? Where?
If it's up, then it's stuck there
If it's up, then it's stuck there
How I'ma get this money plus care?
How I'ma get this money plus care?
I can't do them two things at once
I just dropped two singles once
I was just too single once
And I hit two singles once, yeah
On my mic, two sing at once, yeah
Coffee cup, two cream at once
Got a new bitch on the balcony
I only had two single months
