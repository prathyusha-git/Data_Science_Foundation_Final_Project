Here we lay face to face once again
The silence cuts like a knife as we pretend
And I'm wonderin' who will be the first
To say what we both know
We're just holding on to could have beens
And we should be letting go
It feels like you're a million miles away
As your lying here with me tonight
I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending
We play the part but we're just pretending
And I can hide the tears
Cause even though you're here
It feels like you're a million miles away

Was it me, or was it you that broke away?
From what we were just like the seasons love has changed
And every I think about it
It tears me up inside
Like the rivers of emotion but I got no more tears to cry
It feels like you're a million miles away
As your lying here with me tonight
I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending
We play the part but we're just pretending
And I can hide the tears
Cause even though you're here
It feels like you're a million miles away

We can try to talk it over
But we walked that road before
Boy, our song has played its last note
And we both know for sure
That it's time to close that door
It feels like you're a million miles away
As your lying here with me tonight
I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending
We play the part but we're just pretending
And I can hide the tears
Cause even though you're here
It feels like you're a million miles away
Ehh ehh
