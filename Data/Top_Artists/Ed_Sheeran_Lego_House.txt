I'm gonna pick up the pieces and build a LEGO house
If things go wrong, we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings, but there's one thing on my mind
It's all for you, mm
And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken, I will mend ya
And I'll keep you sheltered from the storm that's ragin' on
Now I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're gettin' down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
Now
I'm gonna paint you by numbers and color you in
If things go right, we can frame it, and put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it, but I've been here before
Now I'll surrender up my heart, and swap it for yours
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're gettin' down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
Don't hold me down
I think the braces are breakin'
And it's more than I can take
And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken, I will mend ya
And I'll keep you sheltered from the storm that's ragin' on
Now I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're gettin' down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're gettin' down
And out of all these things I've done
I will love you better now
