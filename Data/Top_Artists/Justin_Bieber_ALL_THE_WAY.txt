Mm (you don't)
Mm-mm
Lookin' at your face every day
Seven Wonders deep, ooh, and you're the eighth
I can feel your eyes taking over me (taking over me)
Crashing like the waves down in Venice Beach (down in Venice Beach, babe)
Can we hold hands like we used to do? (Like we used to)
Maybe we could dance in the living room (if you want to), uh
Let me spin you round, baby, let me lead (let me lead)
Up against the wall like a masterpiece (like a masterpiece)
And I can make you laugh like I'm supposed to (like, I'm 'posed to)
And girl, I'll hold you close like I'm supposed to (like, I'm 'posed to, baby)
Ooh, I'll make you move like you're supposed to (you're supposed to)
We can take it all the way (we can take it all the way)
Show you that you matter, like I'm 'posed to ('posed to)
All of these emotions that we go through
Ooh, I'll never let you go (ooh), no (yeah)
Ooh, I'll never let you go (all the way)
We can take it all the way
All the way, all the way (we can take it, oh), all the way
We can take it all
And always (ways), I'll keep you safe
If I could, I would erase (I would erase)
Every word that can make you cry, mm
I'll hold you close
And I can make you laugh like I'm supposed to (like, I'm 'posed to)
And girl, I'll hold you close like I'm supposed to (like, I'm 'posed to, baby)
Ooh, I'll make you move like you're supposed to (you're supposed to, baby)
We can take it all the way (we could), we could take it, oh
Show you that you matter, like I'm 'posed to ('posed to)
All of these emotions that we go through (that we go through)
Ooh, I'll never let you go (ooh), no (yeah)
Ooh, I'll never let you go (I'll never let you go)
We can take it all the way (take it all the way, we could take it all the way)
All the way (take it all the way, we could take it all the way)
All the way (take it all the way, we could take it all the way)
All the way (take it all the way, we could take it all the way)
We can take it all the way (take it all the way, take, take it all the way)
(All the) all the way (take it all the way, all the)
All the way (but we could take it all the way)
(All the) all the way (all the way)
We could take it all the way
Don't wanna let, don't wanna let you go
Don't wanna let, don't wanna let you go
Don't wanna let, don't wanna let you go
Don't wanna let, don't wanna let you go
