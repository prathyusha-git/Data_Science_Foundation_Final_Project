If we make it through this year
Then nothin' can break us
♪
Trouble leaves, then reappears
But we've shown we can take it
♪
We tear our hair out and overthink it
Work and get burnt out
But this is no strings, you are who I love
And that won't change when we're fallin' apart
Yeah, this is no strings, you are who I love
It's just growin' pains
If we make it through this year
We should celebrate it
♪
Rarified atmosphere
'Til now, we evaded
♪
We tore the walls down to build them up
Never was in doubt
'Cause this is no strings, you are who I love
And that won't change when we're fallin' apart
Yeah, this is no strings, you are who I love
It's just growin' pains
♪
We did not fight for love
Just to let it be defeated
What we're goin' through is common
But doesn't mean we don't feel it
It would be easy just to give it up
Guess we've got enough reasons
But every time that we have come undone
I'll say, "It's no strings, you are who I love
And that won't change when we're fallin' apart
Yeah, this is no strings, you are who I love
It's just growin' pains"
