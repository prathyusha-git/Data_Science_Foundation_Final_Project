I'm loo-
Even Peru don dey para
Pour out the bottle, I wanna level up
When I'm with you, I never get еnough
Slow whine, I'm not in a rush
I can hear music when you'rе here
Tonight we rolling, party 'til closing
Since I put the ring on her finger, it's still frozen
Love in slow motion
I wanna feel you over me, yeah
Somethin' magic in your eyes, yeah
Girl, I love the way you ride it
And it happens every time you arrive, that's right
Girl, I want you in my life, yeah
If there's a heaven, then it's right here
I will never leave your side, stay tonight
When you wan' see me, when you wan' see me?
I'm in West London this evening
Givin' me the feelings, no I'm not leavin'
Until I fly LA next weekend
Peru, nah, girl, I'd rather go find somewhere quiet
You'll glow, and I'll get lost here in your eyes
Omoge, no be so
Girl, you just capture my soul
Omoge, no be so
Make me wanna just take you home
Peru, para
Peru Peru, para
I'm loo'
Even Peru don dey para

Peru Peru, para
I'm loo'
Even Peru don dey para
Peru, para
Peru Peru, para
I'm loo'
Even Peru don dey para
