Vybz Kartel (WorldBoss), huh
Yo, Trav
She's a good problem to have
I know
Just what I deserve
You make my heart beat, too much work
Just to confirm it
You're like a problem I can't unlearn (yeah)
You only call me up when your tank is on E
You get low and come and fill up on me
Just rock yuh bumper and put it pon me, uh
Don't forgive, I know you workin' on me
She take my feelings and turn 'em on me
Turn my head and she's turnin' on me (damn)
Well, it's that pretty brown round thing
You should be mine, you should get a ring
You know I'll five-star entertain
Baby, just tell me you feel the same
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
My baby was outside all summer
No dry drinks, my eyes ain't runnin'
Like that water, yeah, the money's still runnin'
Oh, you only call me up when your tank is on E
You get low and come fill up on me
Just rock yuh bumper and put it pon me, uh
Lord forgive, I know you workin' on me
She take my feelings and turn 'em on me
I turn my head and she turnin' on me
You've been outside, so why you on me? (Why you on me?)
After-party 'cause we ain't concrete
Reminiscing, you thinkin' 'bout me ('bout me)
You're on my mind last summer
Only one time last summer, ay
You want me back, don't wanna
Use that Yellow Page, search my number
You know I cut the work, you tryna pull up to the 'Burg
You see a herd and now you tryna make it work
You wanna splurge? I'll send you pictures of a purse
A lesson learned, no identifying first
Should've never played with her
Well, it's that pretty brown round thing
You should be mine, you should get a ring
You know I'll five-star entertain
Baby, just tell me you feel the same
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm

Louis V by Saks, then we stop at Jimmy Choo
Yuh love the life, nothin' ain't free

Walkin' on stars like Hollywood
