Hold the line, we ain't done
Don't give up this divine bond between us
The tide is high, nothing's lost
Could turn over a new leaf, for my love, oh
A broken frame, and I know it's pictures of jealousy
♪
You don't believe me
When I show you often, we're sacrificing some time
Why all this in overdrive?
With you beside me, I become unraveled
And you can see right through me
No, we can't go down like this
You are afraid to be fully open
Though you can see all my cards, my heart is in overdrive
My heart is racing, I cannot slow down, and it's bothering me
How forward of me would it be to tell you to forward to me
You should be right here anyways, your energy's calling for me
There's deeper places we can go, don't have to just party with me
I hope we can make it
I hope we can make it
I hope we can make it, oh, oh
I hope we can make it
I hope we can make it
I hope we can make it, oh
Hold the line, we ain't done
Don't give up this divine bond between us
I'm hanging on, but you don't see
It's a phase we'll overcome, my love, oh-oh
The tide is high, and I know
It's just waves of jealousy, me and you, jealousy
You don't believe me
When I show you often, we're sacrificing some time
Why all this in overdrive?
With you beside me, I become unraveled
And you can see right through me
No, we can't go down like this
You are afraid to be fully open
Though you can see all my cards, my heart is in overdrive
