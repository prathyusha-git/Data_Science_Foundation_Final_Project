Ecstasy in the air
I don't care
Can't tell me nothing
♪
I'm impaired
The worst for wear
'Cause I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going...
Numb, numb, numb, numb
Numb, numb, numb, numb
Numb, numb, numb, numb
Numb
Can't you see?
Ain't it clear
I don't care
Get closer to me

If you dare
I double dare
'Cause I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going...
I'm plastered (dry wall)
Look me in my (eyeball)
Do I look high? (No!)
I love the way you lie girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah, come here dear
I'm tryna get closer to you
I'm motionin' you to pull over, boo
I'm the siren that you hear (hear)
I'm the butt police and I'm lookin' at your rear, rear, rear
But odds are I'ma end up in the back of a squad car
By the end of tonight, I'm a rock star
Get your wind up, it's attack of the oddball
Homie can you show me where the gosh darn bath salts are
'Cause I'm sick of sniffin' asphalt
Every thought scarred got my pants off at the crosswalk
In suspenders and I can't feel my lips 'cause
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going...
