It's not true
Tell me I've been lied to
Crying isn't like you
Ooh
What the hell did I do?
Never been the type to
Let someone see right through
Ooh, hm, hm
♪
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say "I love you"
♪
I love you
And I don't want to
Ooh
♪
Up all night
On another red-eye
I wish we never learned to fly
I
Maybe we should just try
To tell ourselves a good lie
Didn't mean to make you cry
I, hm, hm
♪
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say "I love you"
♪
I love you
And I don't want to
Ooh
♪
The smile that you gave me
Even when you felt like dying
We fall apart as it gets dark
I'm in your arms in Central Park
There's nothing you could do or say
I can't escape the way I love you
I don't want to
But I love you
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
