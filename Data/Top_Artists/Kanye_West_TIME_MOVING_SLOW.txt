You were the only thing that felt like home
How I thought I had it all, goin' through the
Messages that's stored on my phone with questions like
I'm not alone
We was gone off that old potion, hit that slow motion
What you got? Goin' rogue, someone left the stove open
We too hot, it was double R, we was Range Rovin'
With the rocky Rollie, Rolls-Royce, Ruff Ryder Anthem just had dropped
Reach for the popcorn, oops, that's my cock
Got my heart broke, I liked that bitch a lot (time)
Time moving slow, I ain't trippin' though
I thought you had to know
Time moving slow, I just thought you had to know
Time moving slow
You were the only thing that felt like home
How I thought I had it all, goin' through the
Messages that's stored on my phone with questions like
I'm not alone
You were the only thing that felt like-
Time moving slow (time moving slow)
Time moving slow (time moving slow)
Time moving slow (time moving slow), enjoy the
Time moving slow, oh yeah, enjoy the-
I, run it, uh, uh
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
I can't believe in you niggas, I see through you niggas
Exceeded the limits, took over my story
And rewrote the ending, I did
Had to show up and deliver that shit
Had the yacht out on the ocean, I did
Go ahead and cry me a river, you bitch
You try to bring me to my lowest
I still brought the vision, I see through the blinds
When everyone is, is a sign of the times
Niggas been fallin' behind
I got some images stuck in my mind
I gotta hit 'em, the perfect, it's time
We finna get it this time, we goin' bigger this time
Feelin' like Jig in his prime
Time moving slow (I thought you had to know)
Time moving slow (I thought you had to know)
Time moving slow, enjoy the
Time moving slow, oh yeah
