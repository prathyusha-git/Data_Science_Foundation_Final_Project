The party never ends
In a motel, laying with my sins, yeah
I'm tryna get revenge
You'll be all out of love in the end
Spent ten hours on this flight, man
Told the pilot ain't no flight plans
Can't believe whatever I'm saying
And they know whenever I land
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Fuck the club up, fuck the club up (bitch)
Fuck the club up, fuck the club up (bitch)
Fuck the club up, fuck the club up

The party never ends
In a motel, laying with my sins, yeah
I'm tryna get revenge
You'll be all out of love in the end

Family function, I ain't no friends
Had a line around my ends
Turned 'em into M's
Why you tryna make amends?
What's that smell? It's heaven-scent
Like I drop shit out the wind
Dodgin' hella sins
I can't go back there again
Now the dogs ain't civilized
Take the one, feel vilified
You can't see my suns
Like the light don't hit this eye
In the function and I'm fried
This strive is not a drive
When they open wide
It's a riot, riot
Fuck the club up, fuck the club up (Bitch!) (nah, nigga, nah, nigga, for real)
Fuck the club up, fuck the club up (Bitch!) (we walkin' in this bitch heavy)
Fuck the club up, fuck the club up (they know me when they see me, nigga)
Fuck the club up, fuck the club up (ahh) (yeah)
