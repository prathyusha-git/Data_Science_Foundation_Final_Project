I don't understand why you blame me
Just take me as I am, it's the same me
We should be a (yeah) senseless sight to see (yeah)
Senseless sight to see (ay)
Ay
Feelin' young, but they treat me like the OG
And they want the tea on me, I swear these bitches nosey
Said he put some money on my head, I guess we gon' see
I won't put no money on his head, my niggas owe me
I gotta be single for a while, you can't control me
Uno, dos, tres, in a race, they can't hold me
And I show my face in a case so you know it's me
Imitation isn't flattery, it's just annoyin' me
And I'm too about it
And the dirt that they threw on my name
Turned to soil and I grew up out it
Time for y'all to figure out what y'all gon' do about it
Big wheels keep rollin', rollin'
I'm outside, 29, G5, Seaside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
But honestly, that sound like a fair trade to me
If I ever heard one and I'm still here
Outside, Frontline, Southside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
Honestly, that sound like a fair trade to me
Look, don't invite me over if you throw another pity party
Lookin' back, it's hard to tell you where I started
I don't know who love me, but I know that it ain't everybody
I can never love her, she a busybody
Baby, if you want me, can't be turnin' up with everybody, nah
Can't be fuckin' on just anybody, yeah
I got feelings for you, that's the thing about it, yeah
You know that it's somethin' when I sing about it, yeah
Mama used to be on disability but gave me this ability
And now she walkin' with her head high and her back straight
I don't think you feelin' me, I'm out here
Bein' everything they said I wouldn't be and couldn't be
I don't know what happened to them guys that said they would be
I said, "See you at the top," and they misunderstood me
I hold no resentment in my heart, that's that maturity
And we don't keep it on us anymore, it's with security
I'm outside (yeah), 29 (yeah), G5, Seaside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
But honestly, that sound like a fair trade to me
If I ever heard one and I'm still here
Outside, Frontline, Southside (Southside)
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
Honestly, that sound like a fair trade to me
I don't understand why you blame me
Just take me as I am, it's the same me (I'm trying)
Senseless sight to see (outside)
Senseless sight to see
Rollin' 84s, it ain't no safety
Ridin' rich and wavy
Gotta roll over to you, gotta get my release
Spread your legs downtown as I'm goin' out to eat
Even hear the raw sounds when that raw got me in sleep
I'ma roll on 'em 'fore I ever let 'em roll on me
Split this one down the middle, wake up in the harmony (sick)
Worried sick, I'm sick of worryin' (sick, sick)
It's just the world we in, I'd rather bury them
I'm talkin' fake friends and skeletons (yeah)
Early-mornin' shoulder rubs, the lawyer sounding celebrant (it's lit)
I'm never settlin', this shit get darker than my melanin
At the crib all by myself, this shit been cavin' in
Scrollin' through my call log by emojis, how I'm savin' 'em
Them heart eyes, that peach one, my old ones, but I favorite them
That butterfly emoji hold me down and all my babies them (yeah)
Purple demon face one push away, he got the K on him
I broke bread instead of watchin' niggas break down (break it)
And saved a couple bitches too like I'm from Cape Town
Know their position, you know ass up with the face down (let's go)
I'm never content, two mil' a event, I get it frequent
I'm make an expense, to me, it's just cents
I'm droppin' the top, not to feel the wind
I'm droppin' the top 'cause bro tryna spin
She droppin' her top, she back again
Publicly she at the crib again, company
I let it slide when I really shoulda slid (ooh)
After all the shit I did
Look at how they repayin' me back (oh)
Now follow my rift
Tell me what type of payment is that? (Oh)
I put that on my kid
And my trust, yeah, it is what it is
I'm outside, 29, G5, Seaside (ah)
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace (ah)
But, honestly, that sound like a fair trade to me
If I ever heard one and I'm still here
Outside, Frontline, Southside (Southside)
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace (ah)
Honestly, that sound like a fair trade to me
I don't understand why you blame me
Just take me as I am, it's the same me
We should be a senseless sight to see
Senseless sight to see (ay)
Up on a mountain (up on a mountain)
Search through the valley (search through the valley)
You hear me calling (you hear me calling)
Won't you come find me? (Won't you come and find me?)
Please don't forsake me (please don't)
All of a sudden (all of a sudden)
My heart is breaking (mm-hm)
I feel it coming (I, I)
