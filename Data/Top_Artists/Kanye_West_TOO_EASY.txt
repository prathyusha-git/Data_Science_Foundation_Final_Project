Two of them, two keys
Too breeze, too easy
Too breeze, too easy
Too breeze, too easy
Remember mama tellin' me it'll be alright
Let go all of my problems and call Christ
I done finally made sense out this whole life
They've been tryna phony kick it my whole life
But if nobody love me, I gonna love me
I don't need you to love me, love me
'Cause if nobody love me, I gonna love me
I don't need you to love me, love me
And if nobody love me, I gonna love me
I don't need you to love me, love me
My God! I'll go get a green light
I've been way too focused on me, right?
I don't really have to look back in hindsight
Tunnel vision, I know God got my blind side
'Cause if nobody love me, I gonna love me
I don't need you to love me, love me
But if nobody love me, I gonna love me
I don't need you to love me, love me
