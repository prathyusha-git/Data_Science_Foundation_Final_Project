Ayy, yo
Ayy, ayy
Oh
Finding myself, showing myself
Finding a way to stay outta the way
Holding me back, supposed to come right back
Guardin' myself while I'm all on display
I know you know all about it
I know, deep down, you feel the same
I know you know how I feel
I know you know how I feel
How do I, how do I feel? How do I feel?
How do you say to my face, "Time heals"?
Then go and leave me again, unreal
I see us fadin' away
I'm still holdin' my breath for the day that you will
See that the effort I make is too real
How can you say that you know I feel?
Ayy (whee)
How can you say you know what I'm feeling?
Know what I'm feeling, you don't feel nothing
Nothing is healing, time is just killing
How can you say you know what I'm feeling?
Know what I'm feeling, but you don't feel nothing
Time isn't healing, time is revealing
How are you feeling? You don't feel nothing
