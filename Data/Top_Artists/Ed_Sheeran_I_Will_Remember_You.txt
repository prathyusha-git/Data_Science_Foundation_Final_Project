I will remember you in the way you'd want me to
But it's hard to come to terms right now
♪
Sunset looked today as if it knew you'd gone away
Now it's night, I hear the rain crash down
Oh, I'd cry, but this is more than just my pain
Oh, I should be a shoulder, not a burden
And it's time for me to call your son again
And say
She was the starlight in darkness
She was the first bloom in spring
An angel with a smile like electric light
All the time hid her wings
She was the birdsong in morning
But now everything here has changed
All the world's less beautiful
Since you've been away
I will remember you with white wine by the barbecue
On New York, at the birthday do, downtown
All that comes to mind when I think about that time
Is a memory of laughin' out loud
Oh, I wish that I could take the pain away
And just talk to him in person
But it's time for me to call your son again
And say
She was the starlight in darkness
She was the first bloom in spring
An angel with a smile like electric light
All the time hid her wings
She was the birdsong in morning
But now everything here has changed
All the world's less beautiful
Since you've been away
This doesn't make sense
I wish I could change it, but I can't do anything

My heart is racing
And my soul is aching, lover

Well, she was the starlight in darkness
She was the first bloom in spring
An angel with a smile like electric light
All the time hid her wings
She was the birdsong in morning
But now everything here has changed
All the world's less beautiful
Since you've been away
The world's less beautiful
Since you've been away
