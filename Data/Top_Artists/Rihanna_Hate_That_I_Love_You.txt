Yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah
That's how much I love you (yeah)
No, whoa, whoa
That's how much I need you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for a while?
No
But you won't let me
You upset me, girl, and then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden, I forget that I was upset
Can't remember what you did
But I hate it
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong
But I hate it
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't want to fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you
And I hate how much I love you, boy (yeah)
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you)
And I hate how much (yeah) I love you, boy (ooh, whoa)
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so (ooh)
And you completely know the power that you have
(The power that you have)
The only one that makes me laugh
(The one that makes me laugh)
Sad, and it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact that I (I)
Love you beyond a reason why (why)
And it just ain't right, oh
And I hate how much (hey) I love you, girl
I can't stand how much I need you (yeah, yeah)
And I hate how much I love you, girl (no, whoa, whoa)
But I just can't let you go
But I hate that I love you so
One of these days, maybe your magic won't affect me (mm)
And your kiss won't make me weak
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me
Yeah, ooh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
That's how much I love you (how much I need you)
That's how much I need you (how much I love you)
That's how much I love you (oh, I need you)
That's how much I need you (I need you)
And I hate that I love you so
And I hate how much I love you, boy
I can't (hey) stand how much I need you (can't stand how much I need you)
And I hate how much I love you, boy (yeah, oh)
But I just can't let you go (but I just can't let you go, no)
But I hate that I love you so (ooh, oh)
And I hate that I love you so, so
