Don't think twice
We're still in formation
Testing the current
Already I'm sailing, it's all so sudden
Catching a flight
You think we're moving too fast, I'm
Intoxicated
We can move in slow motion if that's what you want, babe
I don't want to come on too strong
But I'm moving to your room now
With every move, with every move you make, babe
I'm tumbling
♪
In your own time
Would you show me something please, babe?
Don't wanna wait in vain
You're the missing piece I, I been longing for
Don't deny, oh no
The temperature's rising inside
The cracks are showing
Show me all your colors, I may not deserve you
I don't want to come on too strong
But I'm moving to your room now
With every move, with every move you make, babe
I'm tumbling
