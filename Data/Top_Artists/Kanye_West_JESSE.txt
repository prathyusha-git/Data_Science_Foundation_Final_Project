Jesse had to go to private school
Jesse dad's cool, Jesse had rules
Jesse daddy from the old school
Everything was cool 'til she cut loose
Party life all night
Run the night all night
Running lights all night
She party like all night
Jesse gonna get a text from Harden, then
She gon' switch up again
She gon' tell her daddy, "Don't call again"
You will never speak to her again
All that Jesse wanted was an audience
Now she showin' out for her friends
Jesse wearin' chrome on her heart again
And you ain't never gonna speak to him
Daddy had to buy her what she choose
Jesse dad cool, Jesse had rules
Jesse daddy pick her up from school
Everything was cool 'til she cut loose
Party life all night
Run the night all night
Running lights all night
Party like all night
Jesse gonna get a text from Harden, then
She gon' switch up again
She gon' tell her daddy, "Don't call again"
You will never speak to her again
All that Jesse wanted was an audience
Now she showin' out for her friends
Jesse wearin' chrome on her heart again
Jesse poppin' out again
Jesse had to go to private school
Jesse dad's cool, Jesse had rules
Jesse daddy from the old school
Everything was cool 'til she cut loose
Now y'all friends
Right, right now y'all friends
But you know if she get a check from Harden, then
She gon' switch up again
