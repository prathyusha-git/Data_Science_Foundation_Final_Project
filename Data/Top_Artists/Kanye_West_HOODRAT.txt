You look like a piece of hallelujah
Wrapped up in, have mercy, Lord
I know that I've got a nice whip
But I hope that me and you could be on one accord
I shot, I scored (ah, ma', what up?)
I take it off the board, headboard
Ah, boom, nigga (nigga, ah, ma', what up?)
She fell in love with the sword
I sliced, I diced, I hit it from the back
Whore, whore (ah, ma', what up?)
But I respect your feelings
When your toes tried to touch the ceiling havin' safe sex (auntie)
Of course, unlock the door, bought all the things that you could dream of
Had I bought a Chanel, Gucci, Pucci creamer
But we all know the outcome that fucked up the income
And then some have mercy, Lord
A nigga eyes on dim sum, let the light dim some
Catch me on your TV, heart broke GD
You look like a piece of hallelujah
Wrapped up in, have mercy, Lord
I know that I've got a nice whip
But I hope that me and you could be on one accord (nigga)
One maker, real breath taker, real rump shaker
Do that, whip what her mama gave her
911, let me call my savior
Jesus on the main line, brand new T-shirt (ah, ma' what up?)
Don't make me stain mine
Drank so much, she throwin' up my gang sign
Throwin' up my gang sign
Throwin' up my gang sign

People are funny, they know, Kanye's great too
But the way he conducts himself, they hate to believe it
But they can't help it, they know he's great (right)
Why would-? Listen, the shit Kanye say is basically
Affirmations' what people say for success
And it sounds insane, because that's what motherfuckers do
But he sounds insane and that's sounds of a leader
No doubt he's got some mental fuckin' issues, most leaders do
The delusional issue, "I'm a God"
