Give me somethin' I can feel
Light a cigarette just so I can breathe
Give me somethin', somethin' real
Seven hundred feet off the coast of Greece
Give me somethin' I can feel
No reservation, pull up twenty deep
Give me somethin', somethin' real
I would trade it all just to be at peace
Stop, the gear's too high, this is overload
And no matter what car is sittin' outside
It's a lonely road
It's a double-edged sword
Cuttin' off ties with the ones I know
So tell me how the fuck am I still alive?
It's a miracle (no)
And I can't believe
Ran through a B at Louis V
It's what I need right now (oh)
It's just money
At the gates of hell, no VIP
Everybody waits in line
So give me somethin' I can feel
720S, 750V
Give me somethin', somethin' real
I was in Maldives sippin' burgundy
Give me somethin' I can feel
Prada on my dick, Prada on my sleeves
Give me somethin', somethin' real
I could play that pussy like it's Für Elise
I got real habits
I'm a snowmobile addict
Teal Patek
Steel when I feel panic, ah
Throw a mil at it
Problem, throw a pill at it
Still at it, sign another deal addict (uh)
And I can't believe
Everybody gets to drink for free
So give me one more round (oh)
No cover fee
At the gates of hell, no VIP
Everybody waits in line
So give me somethin' I can feel
Light a cigarette just so I can breathe
Give me somethin', somethin' real
How much psilocybin can a human eat?
Give me somethin' I can feel
Whiskey lullaby just to fall asleep
Give me somethin', somethin' real
And it's what I want, it ain't what I need
(Give me somethin' I can feel)
Got everything, guess I'm hard to please
(Give me somethin', somethin' real)
I would trade my life just to be at peace
(Give me somethin' I can feel)
(Give me somethin', somethin' real)
