Once again, the clouds are gatherin'
To release what they held in (ooh)
What they held in (held in)
What they held in (held in)
What they held in (held in)
Once again, the clouds are gathering (oh, oh-oh)
(Once again, once, on-, on-, on-)
To release what they held in (oh-oh)
(Once again, once, ag-again, once)
Once again, the clouds are gathering (yeah) (oh, oh-oh)
To release what they held in (oh-oh)
How much to stop the clock from speedin'?
They might try to slow down
How much to stop my daughter from growin'?
I just can't take it now
'Cause she just doin' all the shit I did when I was her age
I don't know how I'm gonna tell her, but her dad's just afraid
Of her choices, know that I've been through it
I just hope I haven't been the wrong influence
Put her on game before the world put her through it
Ooh-ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh
That's why I gotta break the curses that were sent for me
This is hard work, workin', this ain't destiny
My motivation is just lookin' at my family tree
I'm tryna make sure I contribute for the legacy
Once again, the clouds are gathering (oh, oh-oh)
(Once again, once, on-, on-, on-)
To release what they held in (oh-oh)
(Once again, once, ag-again, once)
Once again, the clouds are gathering (once again) (oh, oh-oh, yeah)
To release what they held in (oh-oh)
Once again, the clouds are gathering (oh, oh-oh)
To release what they held in (oh-oh)
Once again, the clouds are gathering (oh, oh-oh)
To release what they held in (oh-oh)
Once again, the clouds are gathering (oh, oh-oh)
To release what they held in (oh-oh)
Once again, the clouds are gathering (oh, oh-oh)
To release what they held in (oh-oh)
