All your girlfriends talkin' bout me, now you ringin' up my phone

Bet you miss me now baby, I bet you'd kiss me now baby

You said potential could never last this long

Well baby, I've been alone for almost all my life

What makes you think that you can ever do me right?

Ain't nobody showed me how
I made it big poppin', yeah
Tell me how you like me now
I swear I loved you, girl, ooh
And you probably went and fucked the world
Well, you can take another shot
Every time you hear me playin' in the club
You never thought that I would ever go this far
