Slow down
Slow down, you on your way to an overdose
Plus, these texts gettin' way too emoji-nal
Way too much time alone
Told the guys that you know I'm headed home, I got a trauma bond
Look at what I stumbled on
Another nigga chillin' on your couch with pajamas on
Thought I was the only one
How dare you have a nigga in your house eatin' Papa Johns?
Where you get that money from?
Lookin' at how far we come, I bought your first Vacheron
Guess we had an awesome run
Ever since I lost my mom, you was like my foster mom
Hold me like your only son
Hold me like the homies in the Chi' when they hold they guns
Hold me like a trophy in the sky when they know they won
Wasn't it always this way?
Wasn't it always this way?
Puttin' it all on display
Usin' up all your sick days
Put up with all my mistakes
Listen to all my mixtapes
'Posed to be always this way
'Posed to be always this way
Couldn't it all be so simple?
I could've used that last part for the intro
How it sound when you got Yeezy over Timbo?
From Uptown, but now she rockin' Yeezys over Timbos
Like you don't see me beatin' on your window
Like Chief Keef in the kitchen with the BDs and the endo
But that was me when I was burnin' CDs for my friends though
Now, I can't just take it on the chin like Jay Leno
Now, everybody want the info
These bitches want the pin code, these niggas swear we kinfolk
In a Benzy with a Gen-Z gettin' gentle
If I gotta pay for it, I'ma drive it like a rental
You already know my M.O.
Is you ready for the Venmo? You already know my demo
You already know I'm impulsive
And another baby is my end goal
