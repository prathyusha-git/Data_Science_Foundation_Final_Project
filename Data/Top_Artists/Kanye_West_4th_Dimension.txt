Down the chimney, he will come
With his great big smile
And you'll find that even the kiddies
Are swingin' in the latest style
Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringing?
Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringing?
It feels so good it should cost
Bought a alligator, I ain't talkin' Lacoste
Made me say, "Ugh, uh"
Like I'm mixing Master P and Rick Ross, uh-uh
She seem to make me always feel like a boss, uh-uh
She said I'm in the wrong hole, I said I'm lost, uh-uh
She said I'm going too fast, I'm exhausted
Now drop to your knees for the offerin'
This the theme song, oh something wrong
Might need an intervention for this new dimension
That's too new to mention, or fit in a sentence
If I get locked up, I won't finish the sent-
Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringin'?
Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringin'?

For the light that guide us home, we in the moment, oh-oh
Such a lost boy, caught up in the darkest I had
What's the cost, boy? Losing everything that I had
She been on me, boy, unless you got something to tell
Sittin', waitin' for me slippin', yeah, I'll see you in hell

I really hope the Lord heard me, we all live in sin
Kids See Ghosts off the ropes, Ric Flair on your bitch
Now this the theme song, this the theme song
The put the beams on, get your, get your dream on
But you don't hear me though, drama, we let it go
Watch the guitars roll and let your friends know

What is Santa bringin'?

I mean, you only want two and a half minutes
If you can get it, you know, three minutes max
