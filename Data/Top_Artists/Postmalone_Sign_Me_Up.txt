Yeah
Met her at a party
She drove a red Ferrari
When we went to get naughty
Didn't care I was steppin' over bodies
Some might say, some might say
I found a new religion
Some might say, some might say
I made a bad decision
Said you could have my heart
If I'm good when the rapture starts
You sold me
There's no way that I could resist it (la-la-la, la-la)
Control me
It's startin' to sound realistic (la-la-la, la-la)
If you think I have a soul to save
I might have a little faith
Take that shit for a ride
You sold me
If your love is a cult, then I'm in it
Sign me up
I couldn't see it coming
There ain't no point in running
I'll even cut off all my hair and change my clothes
Ain't even call my mother
For love, you gotta suffer
I'm getting pretty good at doing what I'm told

But I knew the party was over
When she tried to take my alcohol
You sold me
