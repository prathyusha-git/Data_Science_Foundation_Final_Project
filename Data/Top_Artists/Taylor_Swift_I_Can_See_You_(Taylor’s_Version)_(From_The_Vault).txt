You brush past me in the hallway
And you don't think I-I-I can see ya, do ya?
I've been watching you for ages
And I spend my time trying not to feel it
But what would you do if I went to touch ya now?
What would you do if they never found us out?
What would you do if we never made a sound?
'Cause I can see you waiting down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew
That I can see you

And we kept everything professional
But something's changed, it's something I-I like
They keep watchful eyes on us
So, it's best if we move fast and keep quiet
You won't believe half the things
I see inside my head
Wait 'til ya see half the things
That haven't happened yet
But what would you do if I went to touch ya now?
What would you do if they never found us out?
What would you do if we never made a sound?
'Cause I can see you waiting down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew
Whoa-oh, oh, oh
That I can see you, throw your jacket on the floor
I could see you, make me want you even more
What would you do? Baby, if you only knew
That I can see you

I could see you in your suit and your necktie
Pass me a note saying, "Meet me tonight"
Then we kiss, and you know I won't ever tell, yeah
And I could see you being my addiction
You can see me as a secret mission
Hide away, and I will start behaving myself
