Neighbors know this shit get out of hand, but they smile
'Cause you have been so long without a man
And it won't be, and it won't be long 'til you're out of bands (out of bands)
The only thing you really need is a husband
The only thing you really need is a husband
The only thought you ever need is "I trust him" ("I trust him")
All your dreams, all your goals
It's promised with this ring I have in my hands (my hands)
The main thing a nigga got is these plans (these plans)
Got a plan for us, got a plan to grow
Got a plan for homes, got a plan for bad times
Got a plan for good times, got a plan for hood times
Got a plan for hood crimes, got a plan for trust
Got a plan for lust, got a plan for Beverly Hills (Hills)
You know that's where they at (uh, uh)
You know that's where they at
Beverly Hills (Hills)
You know that's where they at
I don't really wanna go back to that
If I do, I know I'm goin' back to back
Breakin' backs and bags, imagine that
That's so hazardous, so I handle that (handle that)
All you really need is a husband, show you lovin'
Let him touch you, let him rub you, let him hug you
Let him thug you, let him hold you down
All you need is a husband who gon' touch you
Who gon' rub you, who gon' hug you
Who gon' kiss you, who gon' miss you with no issue
With no issue, ain't no issue
