I hope he's bright and big, and strong
You already know what I'm on
Tell 'em don't wait up for me
Pullin' up, drop top Porsche
This that glory
I'ma come through and just black out
Just black out
Keep a few Jews on the staff now
I cash out
We finna go where the stars at
And beyond that
This that rip up the contract
Fuck all that
(I hope he's bright and big, and strong)
I ain't gotta ask nobody
Plug talk, plug talk, shawty
And she wanna back it up for me
I'ma blow your back out, shawty (oh-oh)
Got a hundred racks in the morning (oh-oh)
Whoo-ooh, whoo-ooh, whoo-ooh
