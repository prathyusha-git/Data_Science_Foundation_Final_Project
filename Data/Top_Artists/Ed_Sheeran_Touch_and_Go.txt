Wakin' up
Midnight November
And you're still in my bed
It's kinda rough
'Cause since I met ya
There's things we've never said
So if I go
For a little while longer
♪
When I'm home
We can talk about the pitfalls of the road
And if you say go
I would stop everything, oh
My heart would play the role now
And act like it's never been broke
Though, my soul
Lately I really need to know
How long, how long can we be touch and go
Oh, my soul
How long, how long can we be touch and go
♪
It's not enough
To say I want you
'Cause I'll say anything
I'm holding out
To feel without a doubt
I have just been questioning it
But if I go
For a little while longer
When I'm home
We can talk about the pitfalls of the road
And if you say go
I would stop everything, oh
My heart would play the role
And act like it's never been broke
Though, my soul
Lately I really need to know
How long, how long can we be touch and go
Oh, my soul
How long, how long can we be
All of my bones, they scream "I'm right"
If you're taking me home to stay the night
Darling, my soul would heal
If you say go
I would stop everything, oh
My heart would play the role
And act like it's never been broke
Oh, my soul
Lately I really need to know
How long, how long can we be touch and go
Oh, my soul
How long, how long can we be touch and go
