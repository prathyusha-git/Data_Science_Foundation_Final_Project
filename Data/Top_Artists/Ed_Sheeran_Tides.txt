I have grown up, I am a father now
Everything has changed, but I am still the same somehow
You know I've never been afraid of death
But now I wanna see the things that haven't happened yet
I still love getting out of my mind, I should cut it down
I still know people I don't like and I should cut them out
I feel embarrassed 'bout the things that I did in my youth
'Cause now I have a child, I know one day that you will do it
Freight cargo, dot stops and aeroplanes
Late-night calls, signal is in and out again
Feelin' low, serotonin known better days
Go, go, go! But every moment you're here with me
Timе stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And life, lifе is changin' tides

I lost the confidence in who I was
Too busy tryna chase the high and get the numbers up
I have the same dream every night
A bullet through my brain the moment that I close my eyes
I still have to lean on a shoulder when I've broken down
And I have people that depend on me to sort them out
I sometimes fantasize I disappear without a trace
I've no regrets, but wish I did things in a different way
Low fly zone, lawsuits, and film stars
Headline wrote the princess and the face scar
Broken bones, break-ins, and Babylon
Go, go, go! But every moment you're here with me
Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And life, life is changin' tides

Time stops to still
