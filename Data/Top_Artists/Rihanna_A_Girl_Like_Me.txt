Ohh-ohh
Yah, yaeh
Some girls play the game
They all walk and talk and they dress the same
Nothing new to say (nothing new to say)
Don't they realize
That it's so easy to see right through their disguise?
Makes me wonder why
When the whole world's turning left
It's when I'm going right
I need someone to let me be
Just who I am inside
'Cause a girl like me is just a little different from all the rest
And a girl likes me
Never gonna settle for second best
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything if I asked him to?
To take all my dreams and to make them true
Show me all the reasons that you oughta be, with a girl like me (with girl like me)
Ohh, just like me (just like me)
Possibility
Got me trippin', thinkin' of what could be
Between you and me (you and me)
Still, I need to know
Should I keep this feeling or let it go?
I can't wait no more
So now's the time to speak your mind
And show me what you feel
So tell me if you wanna take a chance on something real
'Cause a girl like me is just a little different from all the rest (girl like me, ohh)
And a girl likes me
Never gonna settle for second best (never gonna settle)
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything if I asked him to? (If I asked him to)
To take all my dreams and to make them true
Show me all the reasons that you oughta be, with a girl like me (like me)
Ohh, just like me
Mirror Mirror, on the wall
Catch me now before I fall
I wish I may, I wish I might
Find the answer here tonight
