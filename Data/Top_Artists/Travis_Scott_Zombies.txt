You know when I was 14

Diamond flashes, so Jurassic, dress so classic
Roll that cabbage, get put in casket, you dope fanatic
You the baddest, I'm sarcastic, we both laughin'
I'm the baddest, I'm out in traffic, four engine backin'
Stuffed in suburban, twelve bitches straight out the beauty pageant
You know Reebok keep la feet hot, they be shipping package
GL 600 or the palace, that collab with classics
Tell me what you need, I got everything green
Money, money, money trees, I buy everything
That bitch need no wedding ring, she need a bean (uh)
That boy walked in mall, that boy he need a beam (don't)
I done fucked her twice, you bought her Fendi things
I done sipped the act', now I'ma leany fiend (don't)
I can do this by myself, don't need no team (no)

We will understand if they don't (yeah, yeah)
We don't want they bullshit no more (yeah)
