I met her smoking a cigarette in a toilet cubicle
♪
Red dress, tattooed chest, she's beautiful
♪
This ain't the type of place to start a future, but darling, I don't care
♪
Broken hearts can find a love to make them whole anywhere
Well, darling, here we go again
We are only man and woman, and we all make mistakes
"Don't you know we're only human?" is what I heard you say
When I heard those words, I knew them, oh, I could feel your pain
'Cause I have felt the same, no
Oh, she said, "We are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly, but God knows we can try"
And I see a hope that's in her eyes
Oh, can you see the love in mine?
♪
She told me about her mom and dad, and they sound just like mine
♪
Day by day, exchanging names, and two souls intertwined
♪
And we have both got it wrong from time to time, but let that go
♪
We lead each other hand-in-hand, as we mend our broken souls
Oh, darling, here we go again
Oh, we are only blood and bones that cover beating hearts
Scarred by sticks and stones, but we know who we are
And I could put you back together when you come apart
And we should make a start now, oh
Well, she said, "We are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly, but God knows we can try"
And I see a hope that's in her eyes
Oh, can you see the love in mine?
Can you see the love in mine?
And it feels like we've found serenity
And some things are not what they seem
My love, right now, it's only you and me
She said, "We are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly, but God knows we can try"
And I see a hope that's in her eyes
Oh, can you see the love in mine?
Oh, she said, "We are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly, but God knows we can try"
Oh, I see a hope that's in her eyes
Oh, can you see the love in mine?
Oh, can you see the love in mine?
Oh, can you see the love in mine?
