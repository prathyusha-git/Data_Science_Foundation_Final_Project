Got a call from my mother, who wishes she was here
Couple cards in the post that I'm reading
I want the warmth of the summer, the cold too cold to bear
The only plus is the sweater, I need it
I broke apart from my lover a couple months ago
If they were here, then I guess I wouldn't be alone
This is the life in the city and that's the way it goes
But it's a fine excuse just to leave it
I hit them up, and I asked, "Are you coming over?"
And all I got was a shrug and then, "I don't know"
And everyone I know is hidden away
Tryna make their bodies clean again
And they don't want to celebrate
Nobody cares this is the day I was born
Always the month when parties come to an end
The same excuses from every friend
Another year, and now we're here again
Nobody cares this is the day I was born
Another birthday alone
La-la-lay, la-la-lay
Another birthday alone
La-la-lay, la-la-lay
I hit a bar in town, give my card to start a tab
Every day that we're here, well, we're never getting back
And so I drink for the confidence, 'cause that's what I lack
And end up talking to strangers and find another plan
I end my night in the cab, head spinning, on my own
Watching pointless shit and flicking through my phone
And would April be better? I guess I'll never know
I take the keys from my pocket and stumble into home, and
I feel low, but I guess I could feel lower
I'm heading down, and now I'm on a roll
And everyone I know is hidden away
Tryna make their bodies clean again
And they don't want to celebrate
Nobody cares this is the day I was born
Always the month when parties come to an end
The same excuses from every friend
Another year, and now we're here again
Nobody cares this is the day I was born
Another birthday alone
La-la-lay, la-la-lay
Another birthday alone
La-la-lay, la-la-lay
