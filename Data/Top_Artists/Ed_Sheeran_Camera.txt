You should see the way the stars
Illuminate your stunnin' silhouette
You're glowin' in the dark
I had to count to ten and take a breath
You think that you don't have
Beauty and abundance, but you do
And that's the truth (truth)
You're frozen in motion
A perfect picture in the frame
Some visions don't ever fade
I don't need a camera to capture this moment
I'll remember how you look tonight for all my life
When everything is black and white, your colour's exploding
There's somethin' in the way you shine
I don't need a camera when you're in my eyes
You should see the way this night
Is unfolding beautifully for us
It's getting late, but I don't mind
We'll take this in until the sun comes up
And I think that what we have
Is like every dream I had came true
Lying here with you
A photo could not show
The way my heart is beating, babe
Some visions don't ever fade
I don't need a camera to capture this moment
I'll remember how you look tonight for all my life
When everything is black and white, your colour's exploding
There's somethin' in the way you shine
I don't need a camera when you're in my eyes
And then the flash is gone
But I'll keep holdin' on
To every little detail in the fabric of the night
Never letting go of that inside
Ooh
