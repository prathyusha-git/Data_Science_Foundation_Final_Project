White lips, pale face
Breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men
And they say, she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen but lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, and they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly, angels to fly
♪
Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone
And they say, she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen, but lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, and they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eye, and hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line (oh)
