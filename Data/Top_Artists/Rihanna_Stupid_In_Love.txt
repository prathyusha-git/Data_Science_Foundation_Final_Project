Hmm, stupid in love
Oh
Stupid in love, hmm-mm
Let me tell you something
Never have I ever been a size ten in my whole life
I left the engine running
I just came to see what you would do if I
Gave you a chance to make things right
So I made it, even though Katy, told me that this would be nothing but a waste of time
And she was right, hmm
Don't understand it, blood on your hands
And still you insist on repeatedly trying to tell me lies
And I just don't know why, oh
This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me like I'm stupid (stupid in love)
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid
My new nickname is "You Idiot" (such an idiot)
Hmm, that's what my friends are calling me when
They see me yelling into my phone
They're telling me, "Let go, he is not the one"
I thought I saw your potential
Guess that's what made me dumb
He don't want it, not like you want it
Scheming and cheating, oh girl, why do you waste your time?
You know he ain't right
You're telling me this, I don't wanna listen
But you insist on repeatedly tryna tell me lies
And I just don't know why
This is stupid (ooh), I'm not stupid (ooh)
Don't talk to me like I'm stupid (stupid in love)
I still love you (oh), but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid
Tryna make this work, but you act like a jerk
Silly of me to keep holding on (oh)
But the dunce cap is off
You don't know what you've lost
And you won't realize
'Til I'm gone, gone, gone
That I was the one
Which one of us is really dumb? (Oh)
Oh, no, no
No, I'm not stupid in love
This is stupid (no, no), I'm not stupid (no, no, no)
Don't talk to me like I'm stupid (like I'm stupid)
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid in love
