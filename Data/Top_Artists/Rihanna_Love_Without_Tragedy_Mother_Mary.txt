Red lip stick
Rose petals
Heart break
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes
Tuxedo
Fast cars
A James Dean on the low
Dean on the low
I ask you
What's the matter
You say
Oh, it's nothin' at all
Heart's racing
Outta control
And you knew
That I couldn't let it go
You used to be this boy I loved
And I used to be this girl of your dreams
Who knew the course of this one drive
Injured us fatally
You took the best years of my life
I took the best years of your life
Felt like love struck me in the night
I pray that love don't strike twice
Red lip stick
Rose petals
Heart break
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes
Tuxedo
Fast cars
A James Dean on the low

Mother Mary
I swear I wanna change
Mister Jesus
I'd love to be a queen
But I'm from the left side of an island
Never thought this many people
Would even know my name
As time flies
Way above me
For you
I've cried, tears sea-deep
Oh glory
The prayers carry me
I'll be a star, you keep directing me
Let's make the best scene they've ever seen
Let's capture the moment
Cause even forever ain't forever
I swear by the moment
'Cause together ain't promised forever
Let's live in the moment
As long as we got each other
