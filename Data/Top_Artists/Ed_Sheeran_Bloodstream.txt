I've been spinnin' now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinnin' on my mind
Sippin' on red wine
I've been sittin' here for ages
Rippin' out the pages
How'd I get so faded?
How'd I get so faded?
Oh, no, no, don't leave me alone lonely now
If you loved me, how'd you never learn?
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind
♪
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
♪
Well, tell me when it kicks in
♪
I've been looking for a lover
Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God, make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord, forgive me for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
I saw scars upon a broken-hearted lover
Oh, no, no, don't leave me alone lonely now
If you loved me, how'd you never learn?
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind
♪
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
♪
Well, tell me when it kicks in
♪
Well, tell me when it kicks in
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
Tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken-hearted
Tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken-hearted
Tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken-hearted
Tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken-hearted
So tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken-hearted
Tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken-hearted
