Oh, burn everything like gasoline
Oh, burn everything like gasoline
Oh, like gasoline
Wife got Celine
That's not my thing
We got those tings
Oh, I just can't change
Burn everything, oh, burn everything
Storm look like lightning when I shine (legend, legend, legend, legend)
They gon' know my name before I die (legend, legend, legend)
Glory in my eyes, bitch, this the story of my life
And you'll be sorry that you tried me
You'll be sorry that you lied, yeah, you'll be sorry
I pour out 40 for the guys, this for my brodies in the skies
And not these phonies in disguise, they tellin' stories
Yeah, they tellin' stories, tellin' lies
'Cause the fact is I'm right, so the facts, they don't lie
Uh, they tellin' stories, tellin' lies
Tryna censor my light, but I'm blessed, I'm alright
Storm look like lightning when I shine (legend, legend, legend, legend)
Burn everything like gasoline
Burn everything, oh, burn everything
I just can't change
Burn everything
