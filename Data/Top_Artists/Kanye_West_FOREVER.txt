(Maybe we don't last forever)
Do or die, you and I
Like a blank page (maybe we-)
See inside, most high (maybe we don't-)
Maybe (maybe we don't last forever)
Like a hopeless romantic, oh-oh-oh
Hopelessly, yeah
Just to cope, just a possible word of hope, like
"Maybe", "possibly", "if time didn't exist"
That suit and tie shit, that marathon shit
That take-it-off shit, that Cullinan bih (maybe we don't last forever)
I want you tonight, I need you tonight
Come see through my eyes
Girl, why would I lie? I want love
I want love (maybe we don't last forever)
(I want love)
(I want love)
Just to cope, just a possible word of hope, like
"Maybe", "possibly", "if time didn't exist"
Four billion years in this bitch, these lifetimes blitz
We gon' shine in this shit, every time timeless
Which is more than enough for "forever"
Worth more than big stones, rare metals
Checked in, room covered in rose petals
Lights on, lights off, it's no difference
Still gon' deliver the box like drop-shipping
Last shit these niggas dropped was not hittin'
I don't think you in the spot to talk shit in
Warn these niggas about me, caution 'em
Smoke these niggas like a box of carcinogens
The Hermès always swing through like pendulum
My bitch got the milk, we need cinnamon
Please don't ruin the scene, we all filmin' it
Throw that shit in a loop, I'm relivin' it
Throw that shit on me, I keep killin' it
