Cable car
Flying high
Passing stars, wondering why
Did she go or did she die?
I don't know

Mountainside
Not so green
Snow is more than ever seen
Will she come back in a dream?
I don't know
Thoughts of her reminding me
Of a time I couldn't see
Anything but you and me together
Colored cloud
On you go
To a land you may not know
If you see her
Tell her I'm so alone
