Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-c'mon, uh-c'mon
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-c'mon, uh-c'mon
Uh-cuh-cuh-cuh, cuh-cuh-c'mon, cuh-c'mon
C'mon, c'mon
All or nothing, while I'm in this
C'mon, c'mon
It's me El Grande, or call me Papi Chulito
Yo tengo mucho lovin' for you mamis if you legal
For honeys, nothing equal to the way I tap that spot
Get your cat hot, guess what? You hit the jackpot
Candle-light dinners for you winners, huh
See like I'm like Don Juan, hit me sweetie, I get in ya
Sugar, I'mma put y'a in a beautiful mood
Forget about that lame, he ain't a suitable dude
Word up, I'm the one you like to talk to
You'll find my conversation so enlightening that you sparkle
Hoy ya ven aquí, so I can hold you tight, mold you right
Listen girl, I got more game than Dolemite
It's only right, baby, that we blend together
You'll be wanting me to be your friend forever
And ain't it clever boo, how I got you sprung?
So when I holler yo, you know you gotta come
Dame little mami, ven aquí
(Dame, dame, dame, dame)
I'm sorry, that's as far as my Spanish goes
Several words, like "si"
Because I like what I see (I like what I see, yeah)
I was thinkin' we should get together on the low
You and me
What that chulo? You lookin' at my kulo?
Said you got that prosciutto, but I won't call you my boo though
I'm too cool yo, they call me la negrita for real
And it's really nice to meet you, heard you like a big deal
So what it do? You checkin' for me twice in a blue
Shit I spit too, bet I'm probably nicer than you
I mean let's talk about it
Start with a G through the park and have a walk about it
Like what's your favorite color?
Why you wanna be my lover? Tell me, how's ya' mother?
Could you meet me up town when I'm thinkin' of ya'
No time for another sucker, let him ring the buzzer
I'm sippin' honey, dippin' sundress in the summer
Jiggy mami right, droppin' niggas like mics
Plus I've never been the type to fall in love with the hype
Eatin' my rice, hit 'em with the dímelo papi
Got a thing for baggin' bapis in my beef & broccoli, what
Dame little mami, ven aquí
(Dame, dame, dame, dame)
I'm sorry, that's as far as my Spanish goes
Several words, like "si"
Because I like what I see (I like what I see, yeah)
I was thinkin' we should get together on the low
You and me
(Uh, uh-c'mon)
Let's get together baby, ah, ah
Let's get together baby, ah, ah
Let's get together baby, ah, ah, ah
Oh, ah, ah, yeah
Let's get together baby, ah, ah
