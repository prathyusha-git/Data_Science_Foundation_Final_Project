Look at all them crazies
Growin' wild as daisies
Cut em' out like some paper dolls
Duplicate, imitate, wait!
One's out of line
Has its own mind
Doesn't belong?
The shapes wrong!
Why would you put a circle in a square?
I'm who I am
Love me if you dare
The one and only
I'm not normal
And I don't need you to be to be with me
I'm not normal
Just know that what you get is what you see
I'm not normal
Come with love and satisfaction guaranteed
And I make no apology
I'm not normal
Face without a filter
Rather be off kilter
Don't need no one to validate
Swipe it left, swipe it right
I'm awkward and long
Scarred but I'm strong
My own design
First of my kind
Some look away
And some people stare
Diamonds are jewels
Just because they're rare
One and only
I'm not normal
And I don't need you to be to be with me
I'm not normal
Just know that what you get is what you see
I'm not normal
Come with love and satisfaction guaranteed
And I make no apology
I'm not normal
Be what you gon' be
Pop it, drop it, set it free
Be what you gon' be
Don't worry about nobody
Be what you gon' be
Never care what people say
Be what you gon' be
What is normal anyway?
I'm not normal
And I don't need you to be to be with me
I'm not normal
Just know that what you get is what you see
I'm not normal
Come with love and satisfaction guaranteed
And I make no apology
I'm not normal
I'm not normal
And I don't need you to be to be with me
I'm not normal
Just know that what you get is what you see
I'm not normal
Come with love and satisfaction guaranteed
And I make no apology
I'm not normal
Don't worry about nobody
Don't worry about nobody
Don't worry about nobody
Don't worry about nobody
