Kindly disregard this one feeling
My clothes on the floor can be misleading
As soon as they're unpacked, they'll need to be put back
To me, it always seems I am leaving
Yes, to me it always seems I am leaving
This bed can be decieving
'Cause my time here is so fleeting
These bones hold the load of the open road
To me, it always seems I am leaving
Well, to me it just seems I am leaving
As soon as I arrive, I must say goodbye
All this despite my pleading
Those relentless miles are never satisfied
Never say you're here to stay
♪
Tangled friends start unweaving
Like a thread from a quilt receding
Even though I'm home, I feel the most alone
To me, it always seems I am leaving
Well, to me it always seems I am leaving
As soon as I arrive, I must say goodbye
All this despite my pleading
Those relentless miles are never satisfied
Never say you're here to stay
♪
There's no point in grieving, this pattern is just repeating
I've seen those tears before and there's something I ignore
To me it always seems I am leaving
Well, to me it always seems I am gone
