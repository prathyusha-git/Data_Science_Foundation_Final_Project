How small and sad this life is
These tiny restless thoughts
Time came and went
One candle lights one more
♪
We're stuck here wandering
Lighter than death, oh go on then
I wonder where they went
Spread light, feel no joy
Sick color and sick sound
Wait for sick to change shape
All fucked up and broken
