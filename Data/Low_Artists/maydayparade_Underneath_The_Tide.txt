We went over the edge and took it way too far
Way too far.
Throwing words like knives.
Somewhere in between, we lost our faith
Found some grace
It's us against the world
If you could take it all away, would you?
Would you take it all away?
Save all that you can and let your heart slide.
There's not much left but it is all mine.
Down in your mind, yeah, we will be fine.
Slipping underneath the tide.
...
Pain, it has a villain and I'm fine with it
I'll move on and we'll be stronger now than we ever were.
Cause we gave it all we had.
Take it all away. Would you?
Would you take it all away?
Save all that you can and let your heart slide.
There's not much left but it is all mine.
Down in your mind, yeah, we will be fine.
Slipping underneath the tide.
Slipping underneath the tide.
Pain, it has a villain and I'm fine with it
I'll move on and we'll be stronger now than we ever were.
Cause we gave it all we had.
