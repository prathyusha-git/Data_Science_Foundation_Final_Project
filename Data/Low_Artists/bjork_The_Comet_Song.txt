With our fingers we make million holes
We run and we fall into pot holes
On a mission to save the world, oh!
We peek at the sky through tree holes
Comet! Oh, damn it!
The comet comes hurtling down
On our precious plot of Earth
♪
Like the bugs in mother's flower bed
We walk on long legs over the sea bed
On our mission to save the world, oh!
We need milk and cakes and a warm bed
Comet! Oh, damn it!
The comet comes hurtling down
On our precious plot of Earth

Grey leaves are too much
For any mother to handle
A father must pull
His black hat down over the eyes
