I know you want it
The thing that makes me
You know I'm just sayin' man, ah (what the guys, guys go crazy for)
Is it the car, the clothes, the money, the jewelry, the cribs, the drugs or the hoes?
Is it the ket', the meth, the weed, the lean, the molly, the boi or the blow?
You can get rocked like Chrisean
How you hating and broke, no fixin' 'em
Riding dick like these rappers are Sybians
Try to press 'em, they lost like Gilligan
I got Jay for my Bey
'Bout the money, call me Mr. Slate
Weirdo rap, I'm the numero ace
Put together like Danity Kane
Fuck your feelings, I'm stuck in my ways
Local niggas be stuck in they place
They don't say none of that shit to my face
'Cause they know I take shots like Klay
I wanna rock right now
Hittin' whippets and eating halal
Get to clippin' while whippin' these sounds
You get hit, you gon' sing like Bilal, uh
Back it up
See that bitch, I'm actin' up
'Cause something right here ain't adding up
Smack it up
One hunnid, ain't no wack in us
Push it to the maximum
I do what I want to
Stay you ain't no accident
Mashing 'em, knocking 'em out park
The way we smacking 'em, immaculate
If I'm in area, that's hazardous
Way out there we too far gone
Leave me alone when I get in my zone
Just fall back, I'ma put you on
Lost out here, can't find no home
Goin' up, so tap in
I'm about to take you for a spin
So buckle up
Nigga, we about to go in
Hands on the wheel no accident
Hands on the wheel no accident
Came through kicking doors off hinges
Look at him, he's so expensive
Make her hop all in my mentions
When she see it, so extensive
Set it up, I'ma knock it all down
Give me a ring, I give you rounds
Lost and found, when you hear that sound
I just wanna see you jump around
Welcome to my house of pain
Where you can get everything
Coming down like April rain
Yes, you may just say my name
Pull up on me, we outside
I'm about to take you for a ride
No one's safe, so run and hide
No one's safe, so run and hide
Let me tell you what I'm gon' do
Tell no lies, just tell your truth
I'm a big dog like Marmaduke
Park itself when I come through
Pull up and I'ma be outside
I'm about to take you for a ride
No one's safe, so run and hide
No one's safe, so run and hide
