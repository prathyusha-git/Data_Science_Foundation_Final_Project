Why, why ignore me
And keep me out all of the time
Do you think I don't love you
It's only in your mind
You don't give me your reason
You don't explain all your ways
It must be the change of the season
That's all I can say
♪
Was it something that I said
That made you stop loving me
I only want for the best
Not to see you in my life
Makes me so unimportant
I can't live with myself
♪
Gone, gone is tomorrow
I'm only living for today
I never thought you'd ever leave me
Now you have gone away.
