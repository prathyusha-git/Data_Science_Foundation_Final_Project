No photos no fame
Nobody knows my name
No future no plan
I'm just an everyday man
♪
Finally we are no-one
I'm walking down the street smoking a cigarette
Nobody look at me cos nobody cares
No-one stares no-one gives a damn
I'm just another face no-one knows who I am
"Un café s'il vous plaît", I order my coffee
Watching people go by nobody bothers me
Nobody knows I am a millionaire
So nobody stares cos nobody cares
This is what it feels like

To be no-one

No photos no fame, nobody knows my name
Life is beautiful I'm just a stranger sipping on champagne
No future no plan I'm just an everyday man
Just another face in the crowd watching my favourite band
I'm lying on the beach with my toes in the sand
Working on my tan no-one knows who I am
A firm hand applies the lotion
Little house on the beach next to the ocean
"Een roomys asseblief", I order my ice-cream
Watching people on the beach nobody bothers me
Nobody knows I am a millionaire
So nobody stares 'cause nobody cares
This is what it feels like to be no-one
