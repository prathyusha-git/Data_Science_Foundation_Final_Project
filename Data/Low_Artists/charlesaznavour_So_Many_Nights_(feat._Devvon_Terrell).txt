So many nights I pray for the day
I knew for my dream, I do whatever it takes
Now here I stand, no one in my way
And now I'm surrounded by all that people say
Yeah, they told me time is of the essence
I ain't sweating, I'm blessed, blessing the tenants
While everybody changing, I never stray from my message
As I sit inside my room, it's a tomb to every invention
And every line that I never gave the time or attention
I'm learning my lesson, you looking for a mention, it's funny
What you would do for the approval of a room full of dummies
You think I made it? But I'm stuck here serving burgers for money
It's funny how I'm selling beef and you don't want beef from me
My written turned into a vision, my vision a reality
My chips are on my dream and you seem to try to devalue me
Value me as less, I got no desk or a salary
You value me by likes on my pictures, not personality
Living my own reality, manifested my vision
Looking at the sky, thanked God for what I was given
Based on how I'm living, I'm wondering if I'll get it
Your passion'll set you free and your fear is more like a prison
We're driven, living life, hope I'm doing it right
Went through hell with a knife, killed every demon in sight
I went through darkness of night to find the brightest of light
You only dreaming at night, I turn my dream into life
We're letting go of who left, you never thought it was right
So many nights I pray for the day
I knew for my dream, I do whatever it takes
Now here I stand, no one in my way
And now I'm surrounded by all that people say
But I will never change at all-all-all-all-all
I will never change at all-all-all-all
I will never change at all-all-all-all-all
I will never change at all-all-all-all
I will never change at all
Yeah, I could've never planned my life like this
I graduated, got a job and still I chose just to write like this
You see the people need advice like this
Building something out of nothing
I ain't bluffing with a sight like this
I know I'm nice when I write, you're like "I don't get."
It takes intelligence to listen, something I can't give
I flip the prespective, you see what I just did? Do you get it?
Now take a minute, no it takes you a minute to keep it real
I'm still broke, but got beautiful women
Who see me as an opportunity
Not human, was given an opportunity from no one ever
Who am I kidding?
Fought for my vision, built a team who all believe in my passion
I'm on my way out to LA, I wonder "How did this happen?"
I turned my dream into a team who all believe in my rap and
You went from laughing to a picture when my lyrics are captioned
And honestly I want this more than ever breathing
The people that need a voice, I'm the voice of people believing
My family all believing it's all in me to achieve it
Don't do it because we want it, we want it because we need it
So many nights I pray for the day
I knew for my dream, I do whatever it takes
Now here I stand, no one in my way
And now I'm surrounded by all that people say
But I will never change at all-all-all-all-all
I will never change at all-all-all-all
I will never change at all-all-all-all-all
I will never change at all-all-all-all
I will never change at all
