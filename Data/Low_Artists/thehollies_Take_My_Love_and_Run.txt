(Chatton / Black)
Time is here
The moments right
There's nothing left for me to fight
Fill me no favours if I'm lonely tonight
All alone on my own
Gotta be the only way
Finally it looks like we've got nothing to say
I don't mind
You gotta be cruel to be kind
And all we do all day is fight
You say wrong and I say right
Take my love and run
Get out before the morning sun
I gave you all I had and more in vain
You won't do this to me again
No, you won't do this to me again
I don't mind
You gotta be cruel to be kind
We're in the life we started
Just a little more broken hearted
