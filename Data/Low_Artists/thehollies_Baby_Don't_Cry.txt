I've got a girl, she's crazy about me
She'll go down in history
Twenty four hours of every day she'll cry
So baby, don't
Baby, don't cry
Oh, baby, don't
Baby, don't cry
Dance a little, shake a little
You can even twist and shout
But baby, don't cry
Baby, don't cry
Everytime we say good night
As I go to hold her tight
Never get to kiss her 'cause she'll cry
So baby, don't
Baby, don't cry
Oh, baby, don't
Baby, don't cry
Dance a little, shake a little
You can even twist and shout
But baby, don't cry
Baby, don't cry
♪
Does she love me?
Yes or no?
Will she ever tell me so?
She just hasn't got the time, she'll cry
So baby, don't
Baby, don't cry
Oh, baby, don't
Baby, don't cry
Dance a little, shake a little
You can even twist and shout
But baby, don't cry
Baby, don't cry
Dance a little, shake a little
You can even twist and shout
But baby, don't cry
Baby, don't cry
