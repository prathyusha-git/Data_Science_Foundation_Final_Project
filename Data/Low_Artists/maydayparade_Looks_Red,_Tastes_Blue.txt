This is the longest day I've ever had
I'm far away but I am right there
If distance only makes you stronger
Don't make it last any longer
My mind is racing and it won't stop
And every thought is something negative
I hope this doesn't last forever
We're always meant to be together
I won't lie, this hurts more than you'll ever know
That's when something told me that
If I pinch myself so that I wake
(That means it never really happened)
'Cause I can feel my tears finding their way
(I fear it's worse than I imagined)
I'm sick of writing every thought out
Reliving every single moment
Say what you mean, it's now or never
Because nothing is forever
I won't lie, this hurts more than you'll ever know
(The thought of you all alone)
Your eyes rolled back as you fade to black
(It's not worth living without you)
That's when something told me that
If I pinch myself so that I wake
(That means it never really happened)
'Cause I can feel my tears finding their way
(I fear it's worse than I imagined)
But I'll hold this memory
And I swear I won't forget your face
'Cause pictures always seem to fade away

Now my blood turns red to blue
And I can't breathe without you
Now my blood turns red to blue
And I can't breathe without you
Now my blood turns red to blue

And I can't breathe without you
No, I can't breathe

But I'll hold this memory
