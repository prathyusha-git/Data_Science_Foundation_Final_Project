In my room, I hear you call my name
Your perfume inside my pillowcase
I feel you and your finger's trace
But I know you haven't been here in days and
I have a video that I watch in my bed
It replays in my head
You say you love me
We, we lay together every night
You touch me
I, I, I'm losin' track of time
You kiss me
I, I, I look into your eyes
But it's only in my mind
But it's only in my mind
But it's only in my mind
But it's only in my mind
But it's only in my mind
Honestly, I only think of you
See your face alone in a crowded room
Hallucinate, that is the one where you lay
But I know you haven't been here in days and
I have a video that I watch in my bed
It replays in my head
You say you love me
We, we lay together every night
You touch me
I, I, I'm losin' track of time
You kiss me
I, I, I look into your eyes
But it's only in my mind
But it's only in my mind
But it's only in my mind
But it's only in my mind
But it's only in my mind
But it's only in my mind
But it's only in my mind
You say you love me
We, we lay together every night
You touch me
I, I, I'm losing track of time
You kiss me
I, I, I look into your eyes
But it's only in my mind
But it's only in my mind
But it's only in my mind
But it's only in my mind
But it's only in my mind
But it's only in my mind
But it's only in my mind
