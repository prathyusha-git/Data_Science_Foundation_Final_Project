When tomorrow comes you'll be thinking of yesterday
All the things you're gonna do
Will be the things you've done
What difference does it make to you
What you were doing yesterday
Today will be yesterday tomorrow when it comes
In or out it's all the same
When you're in you're out again
Going in you must come out of place you've been in
If I'm saying 'yes' to you
It's 'no' if I don't follow through
Today will be yesterday tomorrow when it comes
See then use your mind
Everything is everything all of the time
See then use your mind
Everything is everything all of the time
Today will be yesterday tomorrow when it comes
