MCs be fakin', so now they get taken
Fake MCs, they always act hard
But won't walk the streets without their bodyguard
Fake MCs, they always act hard
But won't walk the streets without their bodyguard
MCs are laid out like stiffs in a morgue
Praise the Lord, you're in awe when I'm grippin' my mic cord
Rhymes are ripped with swift execution
One verse could coerce your girl to prostitution
The Guru is now the brother that you're fearin'
Beware when I'm makin' hits with Premier and
Rollin' to a spot near you, lyrics tear through
Poem to your dome, you better watch your rearview
Niggas been held back too long, we're comin' up
In the streets, we roam alone, so watch me runnin' up
I'm sunnin' up a mad posse of warriors
Night crusaders able to break down barriers
And bringin' faces of death, puttin' MCs to rest
Until there's no fake chumps left
Run, step, yeah, bounce, nigga, bounce
My rhymes are cargo when yours is just a quarter ounce
Fake MCs, they always act hard
But won't walk the streets without their bodyguard
Fake MCs, they always act hard
But won't walk the streets without their bodyguard
Fake MCs, they always act hard
But won't walk the streets without their bodyguard
Fake MCs, they always act hard
But won't walk the streets without their bodyguard
Gang Starr, boy, and that's beyond your comprehension
Mad brothers in every city, you can feel the tension
To stop the killin', wack MCs must die
Who am I? I'm the substance that'll make your third eye cry
Too potent, too high in intelligence quotient
When I unleash my speech, I'll have you punk rappers hopin'
I won't expose your names and your identities
You know you're phony, get the fuck from in front of me
Hardcore fans are fed up from your folklore
Lines strip you raw and infect you like cold sores
And I hope you're not the one that I'm after
Since the days of Adidas, I've been a true master
Fake MCs, they always act hard
But won't walk the streets without their bodyguard
Fake MCs, they always act hard
But won't walk the streets without their bodyguard
Fake MCs, they always act hard
But won't walk the streets without their bodyguard
Fake MCs, they always act hard
But won't walk the streets without their bodyguard
I've been around, punk, but, yo, I still feel young
A few of my crew members like to pack guns
I'm high-strung, but don't mistake me when I smile
I'll murder an entire rap chart with my freestyle
After the killin', just like Casper, I'm ghost
Fakes thought I was friendly, at their wakes I was host
Toast without a gun, you'd be done
Throw up your hands, bitch, and now you know you stand to lose one
Choose one metaphor and then choose another
Wax that ass like a bully, have you callin' your big brother
Although I'm five-foot-eight, they call me sergeant
Got more hoes on my dick than you can fit in the garden
At Madison Square, I shot a fair one
So many niggas knew me that the kid wouldn't dare run
MCs pay cash to ensure their safety
They know they can't take me, the G-A-N-G, you crazy?
I'll be on 'em like a message from God
Knowledge of self while fake MCs play hard
Fake MCs, they always act hard
But won't walk the streets without their bodyguard
Fake MCs, they always act hard
But won't walk the streets without their bodyguard
Fake MCs, they always act hard
But won't walk the streets without their bodyguard
Fake MCs, they always act hard
But won't walk the streets without their bodyguard
Fake MCs, they always act hard
(I'm not a sucker, so I don't need a bodyguard)
Fake MCs, they always act hard
(I'm not a sucker, so I don't need a bodyguard)
Fake MCs, they always act hard
(I'm not a sucker, so I don't need a bodyguard)
Fake MCs, they always act hard
(I'm not a sucker, so I don't need a bodyguard)
