Got to be the illest brother to claim respect
It takes the illest brother, just to get respect
Got to be the illest brother when it's time to get wreck
Got to be the illest brother when I get my mic check
I'm one of the illest brothers known to man
But if you don't understand, see I'm a grown man
And I stand five foot eight and three quarters
Givin' orders to my squadron
'Cause I'm like the sergeant or general
But let me keep this minimal
I used to hang with kids who like to live trife
With a knife, cuttin' kids for fun and pullin' out much guns
And like rivalry champs, fellas stop to get amped
Dead bodies lay stamped to the pavement, so I gave it
Some thought, rememberin' the brothers who are gone now
I'll make a strong vow to make things right
Ignite the mic, get hype and all that
Suckers try to menace but they always fall flat
To the ground as I astound, come around
I'll put you down about the brothers who think they're boss
Think they're gettin' large but in the end they pay the cost
Of their lives and that ain't the way to go out
Even take their boys with 'em 'cause they know their boys'll go out
But when it comes to facin' some time, they're like cryin' like weak
And wanna call mom dukes
But mom dukes is fed, fed up with the shit you did
She knows that you shot and she knows that you crippled kids
But who's to judge when you're tryin' to survive?
The one who moves first may be the one to stay alive
So when you think you're hot and dominatin' the set
Just remember, the illest brother claims respect

Like I said I'm an ill kid, so never dare test me
They wanna arrest me 'cause I'm causin' a frenzy
Fake gangsters come and fake gangsters go
Real gangsters chill 'cause real gangsters know
That quietly you stalk your prey on the down low
'Cause too much talk will get you beef on the street
And brothers in the city have to live this way
It may cause dismay, but I'ma tell it anyway
Yo, guns are easy to get and like a puppet
Some young kid is gonna be the subject
Of internal oppression and example of hard times
To make it out the trap in your mind it's a hard climb
But even if your change come right and exact
There's another brother schemin' so just watch your back
I know a brother who thought he had it all
But little did he know he was bound for a downfall
He'd pick up the heater and go stick somebody
He wouldn't give a damn if he killed somebody
'Cause if somebody would get in the way of him gettin' loot
There'd be no hesitation, he'd just shoot
It's like the good, the bad and the ugly
Except it's reality and you don't see it on TV
Brothers keep dyin' in the streets 'cause the streets are designed
To keep you from havin' peace of mind
I know an old man, he's got a rifle to stifle any young punk
He hides it under his bunk
And I know a kid who's been to jail and
He told me that the system had failed him
So now he's out the joint and he's like flippin' on kids
And the people in his neighborhood are flippin' their wigs
But you gotta check the move 'cause there's a reason
A method to the madness and you know what I'm meanin'
'Cause rather than bein' the herb, the, a chump
You can be just like my man called holdin' a pump
But livin' like that you take a chance with your life
But some things in life sometimes will make you uptight
I'm like an avalanche of knowledge poundin' down all fools
All fakes, all snakes and ones who try to break the rules
And regulations, stipulations made by the gangster
You try to flex muscle, you know you can't hang hops
You're makin' me vexed but yeah, you can go next

You got to be the illest brother when I get my mic check
Yo money, don't front, you know you blew your chance
And now it's my turn so I'ma take command
'Cause I'm like the one who's got all the juice
I always get loose, I got the balls to reduce your crew
Very easily I got more ammo
I'm like the ill kid, psycho manual
'Cause now I'm past the point and I ain't gonna return
And when it comes to your destruction I ain't really concerned
About the consequences 'cause I'm livin' day to day
So who are you to comment about me and my ways?
I get my attitude from livin' and I'll never forget

The worst thing about jail is women come and visit you, man
And they get funky when a nigga's locked up
Right, you be eight inches of glass
You can't reach them motherfuckers
Right, she be talkin' about, "I never did like your mama"
"Who you talkin' to?"
"Talkin' to you nigga, you the one in jail!"
