So long
I've been waiting to sing this song
Not sure if it's worth it anymore
Working anymore
People always asking about you
And people always want to talk about you
Sometimes when I sleep I think about you
With your new someone, oh-oh-oh-oh
Didn't we have fun?
I know it hurts like hell
When you can't be with someone
Try
Never stop to wonder why
Oh, how I just hope you're happy now
Hope you're happy now
People always asking about you
And people always want to talk about you
Sometimes when I sleep I think about you
With your new someone, oh-oh-oh-oh
Didn't we have fun?
I know it hurts like hell
When you can't be with someone
Didn't we have fun?
Though it hurts like hell
Yeah, I don't want to forget
Didn't we have fun?
I know it hurts like hell
When you can't be with someone
Didn't we have fun?
Though it hurts like hell
Yeah, I don't want to forget
I don't want to forget
