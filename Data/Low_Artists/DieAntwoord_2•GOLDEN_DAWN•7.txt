I've seen it all
Face carved out of stone, unreadable
Pretty wise and ugly on the skin
Lovely from within
Baby I love you
And my love is true
You're my everything, I will do anything for you
I would give up all this pretty real shit for you
If you sad, I cry for you
If I have to I'll die for you
Baby I love you
And my love is true
You're my everything, I will do anything for you
I would give up all this pretty real shit for you
If you sad, I cry for you
If I have to I'll die for you
I am the man, the myth
Ninja dominator (Salut, Ninja!)
Fuckboy come sneak this bitch
Fuck you, I'm the danger
I do this thing
Called whatever the fuck I want
(Dare you to look)
I'll show you that I can if you tell me that I can't
The fucking thunder pound, with the underground
Crack, dope, banana whippin'
One life, two wives, 'cause I fuck it up when I slam
We don't explain, we don't complain
Just stick to the fuckin' mission
Set the standard, take the lead, eliminate the competition
I seen it all
When you comin' up and all the motherfuckers wanna see you fall
I don't ever drop the ball, and I'm popping off, so fuck 'em all
I'm on a mission impossible
Yo fuckin' unstoppable
Baby, let's rock and roll
Baby I love you
And my love is true
You're my everything, I will do anything for you
I would give up all this pretty real shit for you
If you sad, I cry for you
If I have to I'll die for you
Baby I love you
And my love is true
You're my everything, I will do anything for you
I would give up all this pretty real shit for you
If you sad, I cry for you
If I have to I'll die for you
Motherfuckers feelin' my passion, others feelin' my pain
Got a lot of real fucked up shit goin' on in my brain
I walk the ledge and I'm on the edge and I'm really tryna' maintain
All I wanna do is bust out and go motherfuckin' insane
I crush it up and I roll it up and I spark it up and I bam
Yo pump it up, I been comin' up, 'cause I fuck it up when I slam
I'm all about that sick kick, I'm all about that rush
Yo i'm untouchable, try me bitch, and you're gonna get touched
I seen it all
Been through hell and back, but I beat 'em all
I do this thing
Called whatever the fuck I want
I'll show yo dad I can if he tell me that I can't
I'm a zef African American
Big guns, we carry them
Our baby mommas, we marry them
Fake motherfuckers, we bury them
I'm a zef African American
Big guns, we carry them
Our baby mommas, we marry them
Fake motherfuckers, we bury them
Baby I love you
And my love is true
You're my everything, I will do anything for you
I would give up all this pretty real shit for you
If you sad, I cry for you
If I have to, I'll die for you
Baby I love you
And my love is true
You're my everything, I will do anything for you
I would give up all this pretty real shit for you
If you sad, I cry for you
If I have to, I'll die for you
