You are not alone
Are not alone
Are not alone
Are not alone
Are not alone
Are not alone
Are not alone
Are not alone
You are not alone
Are not alone
Are not alone
Are not alone
Are not alone
Are not alone
Are not alone
Not alone
I'm making up every minute
A little bit tired
I've ended up in the middle of
Million times
I can't keep up with the feeling
I'm living in now
And I could see you holding on
If only for a moment at all
I wish I could hold the dark
Away for long for you
But you gotta know
You are not alone
Are not alone
Not alone, no
You are not alone
Are not alone
Not alone, no
Not alone
