I should've been the bigger man
I tried to beat the second hand
Couldn't see what's in front of me
And I wanna feel fragile
I wanna break down and shatter
I wanna feel hollowed
So save some face
And say you'll stay
You say you've got dreams
Well what about me, what about me?
It was the chemicals, chemicals
In love it's only chemical, chemical
Turning me sideways
I never thought we'd make it out
You and I were breaking down
Couldn't fix what's in front of me, yeah
And I, I knew we'd be tragic
I knew we'd end in a panic
A beautiful static
So save some face
And say you'll stay
You wanna break clean
Well what about me, what about me?
It was the chemicals, chemicals
You and I were like a chemical, chemical
Turning me sideways
♪
It was the chemicals, chemicals
In love it's only chemical, chemical
Turning me sideways
Sideways
I was born a broken man
I was born with broken hands
I couldn't fix what's in front of me
No
So save some face
And say you'll stay
It isn't love it's only chemical, chemical
It isn't love it's only chemical, chemical
So say something
Say you'll stay
Say you've got dreams
Well what about me, what about me?
It was the chemicals, chemicals
You and I were like a chemical, chemical
Turning me sideways
It was the chemicals, chemicals
In love it's only chemical, chemical
Turning me sideways
Sideways
