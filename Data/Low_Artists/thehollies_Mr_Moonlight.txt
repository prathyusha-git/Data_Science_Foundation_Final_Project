You came to me one summer night
And from your beam you made my dream
Whoa, let me tell you now
And from the world you sent my girl
And from above you sent love
Now she is mine
I think you're fine
Because she loves you
Mr Moonlight
Mr Moonlight, come again please
Here I am on my knees
Beggin' you to please
The night you don't come my way
I pray each day
Because she loves you
Mr Moonlight
