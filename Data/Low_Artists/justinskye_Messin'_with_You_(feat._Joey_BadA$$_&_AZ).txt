These thoughts of life are so safe (yeah they are, i know they are)
If we fall in love
Dont you worry
Cause i don't think you'll change your mind
I dont think you'll change your mind
No i dont think you'll change your mind
Change your mind, you won't
You wont change your mind
You wont change your mind
Im only messin with you, you
Only messin with you, yoou-oou
Im only messin with you, you
Only messin with you, yoou-oou
Only need one
Only need one
And the one i choose is you
Baby lets run
Baby lets run
You and i don't need no rules
I wish we had the world to ourselves sometimes
What a feeling when something feels so right
