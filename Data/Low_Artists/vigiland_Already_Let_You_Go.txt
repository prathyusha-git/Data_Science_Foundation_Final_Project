You took my heart and you painted the whole place red
And when you left me you left everything for dead
No there's nothing you can do to make it up to me
You took my heart and you painted the whole place red
I know you know people know the truth
I could spill it out but there's no use
I got a feeling you've gotta let this go
'Cause you coming back to me ain't gonna save your soul
Stop all your talking, I don't wanna hear anymore
There's no turning back, I've already let you go oh-oh-oh
♪
You broke my heart but I won't let you fuck with my mind
And all the flowers you sent, just a waste of your time, and money
I don't want to hear you out so you can lie to me
And like I said, like I said it's a waste of your time
I know you know people know the truth
I could spill it out but there's no use
I got a feeling you've gotta let this go
'Cause you coming back to me ain't gonna save your soul
Stop all your talking, I don't wanna hear anymore
There's no turning back, I've already let you go
Oh-ooh-oooh, oh-ooh-oooh, oh-ooh-oooh
I've already let you go oh-oh-oh
♪
I won't give you an invitation
Or education in how to treat me, I
Will never settle, not for anything less
You live up to your reputation
Of pure deception, there's no redemption now
Oh-oh
