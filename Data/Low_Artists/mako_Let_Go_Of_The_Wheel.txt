Do you remember whispering on Friday night?
We were drinking whiskey at your father's house
You took me by the hand and then we kissed for hours
Those were the good days, those were the good days
Do you remember laughing took you far from here?
And I could see you crying even lend you held back tears
Leaving me behind was everything you feared
'Cause I remember the good days
What I'm trying to say is
Hey you, let go of the wheel
Let someone cut the breaks lose, let's get lost for real
I know that love will find a way to you, but would you trust me
If it took a leap of faith to make it real
Let go of the-

Let go of the wheel
Do you remember climbing out your windowsill
You met me late at night before the sun could hold you still
We've run into a tire point
And camped out here
Holding onto the good days
What I'm trying to say is
Hey you, let go of the wheel
Let someone cut the breaks lose, let's get lost for real
I know that love will find a way to you, but would you trust me
If it took a leap of faith to make it real
Just let go of the wheel
