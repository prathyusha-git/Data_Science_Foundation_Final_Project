I said people people, come on and check it now
You see the mic in my hand, now watch me wreck it now
What is a party if the crew ain't there?
(What's your name kid?) Call me Guru, that's my man Premier
Now many attempts have been made to hold us back
Slander the name, and withhold facts
But I'm the type of brother with much more game
I got a sure aim, and if I find you're to blame
You can bet you'll be exterminated, taken out, done
It doesn't matter how many, they go as easy as just one
Bust one round in the air for this here
'Cause this year, suckers are goin' nowhere
'Cause my street style and intelligence level
Makes me much more than just an angry rebel
I'm gifted, unlimited, rhymes universal
MC's that ain't equipped get flipped in my circle
I'm aimin' on, rainin' on those bitch-ass chumps
'Cause their rhymes don't flow and their beats don't pump
And niggas better know I paid my dues and shit
I'm 'bout to blow the fuck up 'cause I refuse to quit
I'm out to get the props that are rightfully mine
Yeah, me and the crew think it's about that time
But on the D-L you know that Gang Starr will conquer
That's why you stare and point and others cling on to
My Nautica, askin' for a hookup
Well sorry, but my schedule is all booked up
Nobody put me on, I made it up the hard way
Look out for my people but the suckers should parlay
'Cause it's business, kid, this ain't no free-for-all
You have to wait your turn, you must await your call
So now, now, it is my duty to
Eliminate and subtract all of the booty crews
And suckers should vacate before I get irate
And I'll kick your can from here to Japan
With force you can't withstand 'cause I'm the motherfuckin' man
Right now I got my man Lil Dap from the Group Home
Ayo, step up to the mic and tell 'em why you're the man
So much anger built inside
So don't stop to say hi, motherfucker, just die
My shit holds a mouthful so I guess you know what's up
While punks get killed at the end of the month
Styles and styles I flip, Lil Dap remain sick
Yes, the Group Home is thick, so all you punks hear this
Every time you riff, the more fame that we get
Motherfuckers act hard, thinkin' that they are God
Niggas just don't understand, let me be my own man
Did everything on my own 'cause every place wasn't home
Anywhere that I rest, had to dress with a vest
I guess you get the routine, but with a lot of stress
Frustration on my mind, brothers doin' their time
Rhymes are organized like crime as you're ripped in a line
Brothers just don't know how shit got to go
'Cause I was told to never give my back to the street
As I walk through the ghetto, dead souls I greet
See my man, give him pound, then I walk with a frown
Another minute, another brother's gunned down
Shit is gettin' too close, that's why the Group Home is thick
So every time you riff, the more fame that we get
My father always said don't watch the one 'cross the street
Watch the one right next because he's easy to flex
To keep to what he said, yeah, that deep-ass nigga
While brothers hang around, tryin' to get down
Niggas just don't understand, I'm the motherfuckin' man
♪
And also on the set from Dirty Rotten Scoundrels
We got my man Jeru the Damaja
Yo, tell 'em why you're the man
I'll tap your jaw, you probably heard it before
Step to the battle of mic, I prove my word is law
Drugstore worth more, dope rhyme vendor
Not partial to beef, the chief ambassador
Niggas get mad 'cause they can't score
Like a Wild West flick, they wish to shoot up my door
But I incite a riot, don't even try it
Bust up chumps so crab kids, keep quiet
Like I said before, I tap jaws, snatch whores
Kill suckers in wars, vic a style you said was yours
Money grip, wanna flip, but you're fish
House the mic like your hooker and did tricks on the bitch
Dirty Rotten Scoundrel and my name is Jeru
Utilizin' my tools in '92
MC's step up in mobs to defeat us when
We rock knots and got props like Norm Peterson
Lots of friends, lots of fun, lots of beers
Got the skills, greeno, so I always get cheers
Troop on like a trooper, no tears for fears
I'ma get mines 'cause the crew will get theirs
Cut you up like Edward Scissorhands
You know the program, I'm the motherfuckin' man
