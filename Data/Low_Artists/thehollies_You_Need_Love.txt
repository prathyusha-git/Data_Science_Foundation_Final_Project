When you love somebody
That means a lot
And so you give the best
Of what you've got
It's a reason for living
To have someone
Without a love in your life
You can't go on
You need love
I need love
When you're tired and worn out
She'll run to you
And calm your restlessness
And comfort you
You need love
I need love
No wonder that I always say
I can't live another day without you
I tell my friends I'm feeling fine
Then they know that I'm not lying about you
All your life you'll know that
Your trust was right
When you're holding her close
To you at night
You need love
I need love
