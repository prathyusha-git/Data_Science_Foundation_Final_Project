We washed away the pains of yesterday
And you had run so very far away from me
My eyes, they watched you go and all I know
Is that I never wanna feel the same again
When you looked at me I know
Why I never felt so alive, alive, alive
Alive, alive, alive
Alive, alive, alive
Alive
Do you think we could find our way back home?
We washed away the pains of yesterday
And you had run so very far away from me
My eyes, they watched you go and all I know
Is that I never wanna feel the same again
Do you think we could find our way back home?
