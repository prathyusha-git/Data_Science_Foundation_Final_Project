Hold the pain, keep it silent
Hold the pain, keep it silent
No, my time only runnin' out
'Bout the way that I'm smilin'
Can nobody see I'm down?
Do my best to be okay
But that's all my feelin's allow
These thoughts slip from me always
All I think is how
Now nothin' feels the same
No, nothin' feels the same
Searching for where I belong
I just wanna be happier
Now, nothin' feels the same
No, nothin' feels the same
Learning from where I went wrong
I just wanna be happier (Yeah), yeah
The more I learn, the more I realize how much I have left to learn
Remember back when seven fifty an hour was all I earned
And Mom was workin' overtime, just tryna make things work
So every bill that came in the mail came with concern
I thought maybe a degree could change some things for her and me
Was even honored by the dean, that didn't matter at all
I bought the lie they sold to me at the expense of my own dreams
Said they had everything I need, just need to pay for it all
Well, fuck that
They used to tell me, "Fuck rap, you need to take a step back
Look in the mirror, Mark, and look at yourself"
They almost had me thinkin' I should put my dreams on the shelf
They don't believe in me just like they don't believe in themselves
I took that chip and then I wore it proudly
Along the way I became fixated on those who doubt me
Somehow lost sight of all the blessings that were all around me
I let comparison and pressure almost fuckin' drown me
Was lost until I found me
I treated the world like it owed me
My self-worth came from comments from people that didn't know me
Feelin' lonely, feelin' like I let everybody else down
Barely recognizin' anyone now, and all I think is-
All I think is how
Now nothin' feels the same
No, nothin' feels the same
Searching for where I belong
I just wanna be happier
Now, nothin' feels the same
No, nothin' feels the same
Learning from where I went wrong
I just wanna be happier
I wanna partake in this rat race, don't have a lot but have faith
And how can I create when my mind is in such a bad place?
I finally made some money, but more issues is what that made
Remember thinkin' that I'll be happy once I reach that place
But not so much, I did it, I felt the rush
But on the way, I left some people and things I love in the dust
That's when I finally realized how now enough is never enough
I wear the smile on my face and nobody has called my bluff
I'm honest, I may have added some commas
But what's naïve to think that money could alleviate problems
I let the numbers become all the validation I seek
Now I know showin' my emotions doesn't mean that I'm weak
Despite what others may think
And maybe all along happiness was a choice
And I listened to their opinions instead of my inner voice
The old me just really wanted the world to love and respect me
Now I'm sick of livin' life for everybody except me
So don't text me, all I want is to fuckin' live in the moment
Should appreciate the journey a little more and I know it
Kept around the ones I trust and cut everybody else out
Barely recognizin' anyone now, and all I think is-
All I think is how
Now nothin' feels the same
No, nothin' feels the same
Searching for where I belong
I just wanna be happier
Now, nothin' feels the same
No, nothin' feels the same
Learning from where I went wrong
I just wanna be happier
Searchin' for where I belong
I just wanna be happier now
(I just wanna—)
