The body's a temple for heavier metal
And forever chemicals
A future-proof ghost town
Curse words carved in the playground
White noise that resounds
It's an ancient oil painting (ooh-ooh)
Of the brain in repose (ooh-ooh)
They're the birds that build their nests (ooh-ooh)
Inside of the Home Depots (ooh-ooh)
Living in here rent-free, talking like they know me (ahh, ahh)
You are gonna have to deal with all this
Okay, sure, I'll get right on that, promise

A nihilist trust-fall into the paywall of endless potential
You'll lose the urge to self-destruct, but
Fear not, we know that you're still punk as fuck
