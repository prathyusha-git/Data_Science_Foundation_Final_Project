Behold the ghost of winter's past
Sunday mornings never last, they just float away (they just float away)
But something still remains
I felt its warmth, I heard its laugh
I saw the mark drawn on its back
Do I make it something to eat?
When all I want is for it to leave me alone
(Disposable love)
(Enough is enough)
So how do I make you leave?
Baby, I swear it's you, not me
Maybe I'm a little burned
And need something more than you
(Na, na, na, na, na)

Oh, I know how shallow of me
With all that plastic in the sea
They say the earth is dying (dying)
What good is all my crying?
(Disposable love) disposable love
(Enough is enough)
So how do I make you leave?
Baby, I swear it's you, not me
Maybe I'm a little burned
And need something more than you
(Na, na, na, na, na)
Disposable love
Disposable love
Enough is enough
Maybe it's time we cut this off
Disposable love
Enough is enough
Useless with or without this headache
