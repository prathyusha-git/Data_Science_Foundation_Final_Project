Oh baby, I'm aware of where you go
♪
Each time you leave my door
Watching you walking down the street
Knowing there's another guy you meet
This time before you run to him
Leaving me alone again
Think it over
Haven't I been good to you, babe?
Think it over
Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop in the name of love
Before you tear it apart
I'm trying hard, hard to be patient
Wish you'd stop this infatuation
But each time I think of you together
I see myself losing you forever
This time before you leave my heart
And rush back into his arms
Think it over
Haven't I been good to you, babe?
Think it over
Haven't I been sweet to you, baby?
Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop in the name of love
Before you tear it apart
