Today, we don't know who we are
Ashamed, hiding behind the scars
Too many times we let the things we feel
Get in the way of letting us heal the wounds
That open in the dark
Did you ever feel sunlight on your face?
Did you ever taste clouds?
Did you ever touch space?
Did you ever feel sunlight on your face?
Did you ever truly live?
♪
So walk in time to life's refrain
Relax, don't do it to yourself again
Decaying yourself with all the love you won't give
Killing yourself about the way you don't live now
'Cause you're not gonna live forever
Did you ever feel sunlight on your face?
Did you ever taste clouds?
Did you ever touch space?
Did you ever feel sunlight on your face?
Did you ever just live, just live?
