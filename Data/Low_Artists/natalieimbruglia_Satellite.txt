Do you lie awake in the mornin'
Tryna find a reason to call me?
'Cause honey, all that I've been doin'
Is thinkin' about your smile
But none of this is necessary
With me, baby, you see, baby
'Cause I like to keep it all simple
'Cause you are my satellite
(Burning up, burning up, satellite)
So I'm tryin' to keep you in sight
(So you might wanna just sit tight)
But with all this space, can we keep it alive, keep it alive?
So I'm askin' you, baby, are you comin' down tonight?
Doo-da-da-da-doo-da
There's somethin' in the air tonight
It feels right
But you're keepin' me guessin'
And I'm findin' it hard to catch your eye
So move a little closer, it's alright
I know what you're thinkin'
You've been circlin' me for a while
'Cause you are my satellite
(Burning up, burning up, satellite)
So I'm tryin' to keep you in sight
(So you might wanna just sit tight)
But with all this space, can we keep it alive, keep it alive?
So I'm askin' you, baby, are you comin' down tonight?
Doo-da-da-da-doo-da, doo-da
Sha-da-da-da-ba-ba, hey
