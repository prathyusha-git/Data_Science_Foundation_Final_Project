Well, it sure look good, but it don't mean a thing to me
Yes, it sure look good, but it bon't mean a thing to me
I've got a cool shakin' baby
Shake like a wildwood tree
Yeah, you went away, baby
You got back a little too late
Yeah, you went away, baby
You got back a little too late
I've got a cool shakin' baby
Shake like jello on a plate
When my baby walks
You know she's fightin' below
Yeah, when my baby walks
You know she's fightin' below
Yes, and when she stops
Flesh, it shakes like jello
Well, now shake, little baby
Shake it for me
Yeah, now shake, little baby
Shake it for me
Yeah, now shake a little, baby
Shake like a wildwood tree
Now let it shake
Now let it shake
Now let it shake
Now let it shake
Let it shake a little, baby
Shake like a wildwood tree
Thank you very much
