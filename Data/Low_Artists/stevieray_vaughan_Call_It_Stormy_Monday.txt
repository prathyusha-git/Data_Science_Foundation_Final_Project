They call it stormy Monday
But Tuesday's just as bad
They call it stormy Monday
But Tuesday's just as bad
Lord and Wednesday's worse
Thursday's oh so sad
The eagle flies on Friday
Saturday I go out to play
The eagle flies on Friday
Saturday I go out to play
Sunday I go to church
I get down to pray
Lord have mercy, lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy, lord have mercy on me
You know I tryin', tryin' to find my baby
Pleas
