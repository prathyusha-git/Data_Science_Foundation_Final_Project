It's a ghost town
Dreaming in footprints
♪
Can't leave a healthy well
So poison and escape
♪
The soundtrack for then
Is a taxi for now
♪
Cover up with the shadows
Sleeping on the floor

Goddamn, I wish I was
A little bit smarter
To be the future-bound
We'll try rewound
I wish I was a little bit smarter
I wish I was
Can I be her true love?
A concentrator?
♪
And a circuit in your lullaby
A conferencing enemy
