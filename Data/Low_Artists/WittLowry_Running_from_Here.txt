Yeah, it's always mundane, always the same
All about the same girl and the same pain
Now I got two girls with the same name
Wait, I'm feeling myself
See, it's been a whole week, and I can't even tell
Right between going to heaven or going to hell
Feel like I'm stuck in a cell
Told me I'm selling my soul, are you selling yourself?
I feel like I'm walking on shells
What should I tell? Feel like Adele
Feel like my hands in the nail is the way that they want me
Stay quiet and keep to yourself
Maybe we're living in hell
Maybe it's all in our minds, or all a matter of time
You have no vision, you're blind
And lately I'm losing myself, now I'm harder to find
I feel like I'm stuck in a bind
Feel like I'm stuck in a Vine
Looping a day at a time
Wake up, you're working at nine
Why are we told never get out of line?
And why would I think you would ever be mine?
You never gave me a sign
And now you're the one that I'm leaving behind
Running from something that's bigger than I
I'm, so sick of nothing, wanna be something, Sausage McMuffin
Just to ease the pain this morning while my stomach's rumbling
Minimum wage, another day that I can't pay
Nothing's stuck in fucking gray
You eat gourmet, I microwave oven
Running, you're stuck on a leash
Wanna see Spain, and I wanna see Greece
Wanna see things I would never believe
I wanna wake up with a view of the sea
I wanna believe, I wanna achieve
I wanna perceive everything I could be
Perceiving is key, we are what we see
And lately I've been in this rut, now I wanna be free
I don't wanna hold back for you, put it all on my back for you, I
I don't know what's after you, who's after you, who knows?
Lose myself while chasing after you, I only ever got half of you, I
I don't know what's after you, who's after you?
Who knows, and who cares?
'Cause I'm run, run, I'm running from here
You're watching me run, run, I'm running from here
You're watching me run, run, I'm running from here
I'm running from here, I'm running from here
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
I guess what I wanna say is I feel stuck
I do like a girl with a big butt
I either don't drink or get too drunk
And pass out on my best friend's futon
I need to move on from this basic shit
I wake up, eat, and go and take a piss
You do something fun and have to take a pic
And really life is a movie, go and make a flick
You gotta make a pick, you gotta take a chance
Can't see the world when it's in your hands
And when I first started, it was Ty and Dan
Now it's still us, plus a couple fans
I've been stressing and I've been working hard
Hard is not enough when you regard a star
Been shooting far and only hitting Mars
There is more to life than just girls in bars
There is more to life than just getting by
I know you drink the pain, so you can chase the high
When they say you can't, you gotta question why
You will never understand my plan to drive, damn
Still stuck in this town, think of "The Lights" while I'm riding around
I focus on me, I don't care who you found
I'm coming for king, only thing is the crown
I'm tired of feeling so down
They say that I'll make it as soon as I'm found
But fuck being found, I stuck to my morals and ground
I care about my passion, my heart, and my sound
I care about the people here holding me down
My ex was a mess who was messing around
Ignoring your texts, you're irrelevant now
It's over, and now, I'ma run 'til I'm found
I don't wanna hold back for you, put it all on my back for you, I
I don't know what's after you, who's after you, who knows?
Lose myself while chasing after you, I only ever got half of you, I
I don't know what's after you, who's after you?
Who knows, and who cares?
'Cause I'm run, run, I'm running from here
You're watching me run, run, I'm running from here
You're watching me run, run, I'm running from here
I'm running from here, I'm running from here
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
No time to wait
Running from something, I'm tired of safe
I wanna be someone you never replace
I only see pain when I stare at my face and
Damn, open your eyes, open your heart
Open your mind, you're taking your time
You're taking too long, they're gonna forget you without a new song
It's, kinda funny how the game works
Talk about money, bitches, is paid dirt
And we all end up in the same hearse
So your legacy is really what makes worth, and
I don't wanna be stuck in this loop
Complacent and basic is how you will lose
We're standing for something, we're able to choose
And honestly, Mark, I've been running from, you
I don't wanna hold back for you, put it all on my back for you, I
I don't know what's after you, who's after you, who knows?
Lose myself while chasing after you, I only ever got half of you, I
I don't know what's after you, who's after you?
Who knows, and who cares?
'Cause I'm run, run, I'm running from here
You're watching me run, run, I'm running from here
You're watching me run, run, I'm running from here
I'm running from here, I'm running from here
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
