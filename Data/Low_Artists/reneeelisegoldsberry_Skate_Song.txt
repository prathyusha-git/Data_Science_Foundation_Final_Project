Curtains up, bridges down, all over this town
Moving in, going out, get close without a doubt
Breathing deep outside with arms open wide
Gotta love the sound of all my friends around
I don't wanna end this day
Wanna play the record forever and ever
Long as you will stay
I don't wanna end this day
Wanna play the record forever and ever
Long as you will stay
All night, all night, alright, alright
Forever and ever, long as you will stay
All night, all night, alright, alright
Forever and ever, long as you will stay
Now come back to open doors
Come through mine, I'll go through yours
Feels like home in this crowd
One voice singing loud
Now we know what we have cause we sure missed it bad
Gotta love being free with all the family
I don't wanna end this day
Wanna play the record forever and ever
Long as you will stay
I don't wanna end this day
Wanna play the record forever and ever
Long as you will stay
All night, all night, alright, alright
Forever and ever, long as you will stay
All night, all night, alright, alright
Forever and ever, long as you will stay
