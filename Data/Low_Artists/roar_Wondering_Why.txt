The cannibal mind will eat, no matter the cost
But I'm running out of chalk to outline my thoughts
And though you hung up long ago, I never finish our talks
There should be something here to show, but I don't know when to stop
I know that you are wondering why
It still seems like I am falling behind
I know that you are wondering why
It still seems like I am falling behind
I shouldn't be here, I know
If I could move, I still wouldn't know where to go
"Is it always this slow?"
Said the broken pony swallowed up by the snow
