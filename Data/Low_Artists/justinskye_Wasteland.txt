I ain't even tryna hold you up
We can get it poppin where ya live
Imma show ya ass how to live
Any single minute you could get it, I admit it
Boy you must know how I give it up
Way, way, way too much can you feel it
You gon pay way too much just to see it
I got it if you want it, thats hunnet, come and lay that ass down
Down, down, down, down, down, down, oh oh oh
You ain't got no recipe, you just got the best of me
This shit look like destiny, don't you turn your back to me
Don't go talking back to me, you know how to act me
You gon' fall off track me
Just sit back and see
You don't want my love to go to waste, to waste
You don't want my love to go to waste, to waste
You don't want my love to go to waste, to waste
You don't want my love to go to waste, to waste
Do you have somewhere to be
My time is precious, you can't rush me
Can't you see
I talk that tonka, you know
I got if you want it, thats hunnet, come and lay that ass down
Down, down, down, down, down, down, oh oh oh
You ain't got no recipe, you just got the best of me
This shit look like destiny, don't you turn your back to me
Don't go talking back to me, you know how to act me
You gon' fall off track me
Just sit back and see
You don't want my love to go to waste, to waste
You don't want my love to go to waste, to waste
You don't want my love to go to waste, to waste
You don't want my love to go to waste, to waste
