Same black hole from yesterday I fell into again today
If 30 is just a number, then I hope this last one brings me closure
An open book, you try to read me, a paper photo burned to memory
In tattered pieces all around, an SOS that'll never reach you
Upside down and tired of hanging, wrapped around your finger
Here's to wishing you all the hope and joy and happiness this life affords you
I'm learning to fly
Learning to look in the mirror
One day at a time
When you're all that I want, but you're not what I need right now
Can you take the working parts and reassemble broken hearts
You said you hate me, I forgive you for every time you told me "grow up"
Spark an awkward conversation, you talk to me like I know nothing
Anxiety is from the inside, but I'm just locked up on the outside
I wish for you all the hope and joy and happiness this life affords you
I'm learning to fly
Learning to look in the mirror
One day at a time
When you're all that I want, but you're not what I need right now
I'm alone in the dark
I know I'm just caught in a feeling
Comin' up empty
And learning to pick up the pieces
'Cause I'm learning to fly
Learning to look in the mirror
One day at a time
When you're all that I want, but you're not what I need right now
You're not what I need right now
