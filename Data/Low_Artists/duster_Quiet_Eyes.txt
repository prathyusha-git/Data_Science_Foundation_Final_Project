Turn out the light
Closing your eyes
Gentle in
Your sleep tonight
Your favorite voice
Distant the sound
Whisper in
Your dream, not found
Sense your presence near
But out of sight every time
Formless shifting in the night
Pass over me, floating by
When it's time to go
Come say goodbye
One more time
Because everything feels right
Your quiet eyes look at mine
