Me and all my friends watching Casey in the street
Well, he takes a solemn glance my way as he starts to walk away
We never really are what we intend to be
All the breaks in me have surfaced, yeah, spilling out into my bed
And now once again, I find myself inside an empty silhouette
I'll dance around until the light finds me
Poison everything you said you loved, the stuff that fills me up
I feel it burning away underneath my sweater
A little more, just a little more company
I can almost lift my head today, I saw the world and looked away
She said, "Sugar, shake off the shakes and come be with me
We can take the things we want this way, the alcohol and aftershave"
Because once again, I find myself inside an empty silhouette
I'll dance around until the light finds me
Poison everything you said you loved, the stuff that fills me up
I feel it burning away underneath my sweater
So maybe on a Halloween, we'll dress the way we wanna be
Go on an adventure, looking for something sweet
Move forward with a promise ring
Forever is what it means to me
Forever is what it means to me, yeah
Once again, I find myself inside an empty silhouette
I'll dance around until the light finds me
Poison everything you said you loved, the stuff that fills me up
I feel it burning away underneath my sweater
Underneath my sweater
Underneath my sweater
Underneath my sweater
