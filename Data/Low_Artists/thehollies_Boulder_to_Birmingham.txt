I don't wanna hear your love song
I got on this aeroplane just to fly
And I know there's life below me
But all that you can show me
Is the prairie and the sky
And I don't wanna hear a sad story
Full of heartbreak and desire
The last time I felt like this
I was in the wilderness
And the canyon was on fire
And I stood on the mountain
In the night and I watched it burn
I watched it burn
I watched it burn
I would rock my soul
In the bosom of Abraham
I would hold my life
In his saving grace
I would walk all the way
From Boulder to Birmingham
If I thought I could see
I could see your face
Well, you really got me this time
And the hardest part is knowin' I'll survive
I've come to listen for the sound
Of the trucks as they go down
Out on ninety-five
And pretend that it's the ocean
Comin' down to wash me clean
To wash me clean
Baby, do you know what I mean?
I would rock my soul
In the bosom of Abraham
I would hold my life
In his saving grace
I would walk all the way
From Boulder to Birmingham
If I thought I could see
I could see your face
I would rock my soul (I wanna rock, I wanna rock my soul)
In the bosom of Abraham (In the bosom of Abraham)
I would hold my life (Gonna hold my life)
In his saving grace (In his saving grace)
I would walk all the way (Gonna walk all the way)
From Boulder to Birmingham (From Boulder to Birmingham)
If I thought I could see
I could see your face
I would rock my soul (Rock my soul)
In the bosom of Abraham (In the bosom of Abraham)
I would hold my life (I would hold my life)
In his saving grace (In his saving grace)
I would walk all the way
From Boulder to Birmingham
