Niggas don't rap no more, they just sell clothes
So I should probably quit and start a line of bathrobes
I'm cold like Missouri, ask Siri if I'm that nigga
She'll probably answer back, "Don't ask me stupid shit, my nigga"
I'm a stone cold degenerate, working out with no membership (yeah)
A minute late, you'll wonder where the bitches went? (Where the bitches go?)
My manuscript, I can't handle it
Eat ya ass like I'm Canibus
I show up on your screen like tele-evangelist
And I have faith that I can clap those cheeks like
Getting Brown to your yard, need me more than a milkshake
And I say I'm out here
I'm up though
They wanna see me fall off, but they nuts bro
I keep the custos at the front door
Gotta line around the corner for this dope flow
♪
Uh, yeah
Yeah, some of you niggas be talkin' that shit, you be spend all your life being motherfuckin' ratss
Gettin' lined up ain't enough
Getting slapped ain't a dub
Getting shot and ain't do nothing back
Shut the fuck up with them subs
How you posting all day, but claim that you packing a MAC?
These nigga ain't in my league, it ain't right in the head
I'ma pull your daddy out his casket
(Suck my dick, bitch ass nigga)
I thought we chased yo' punk ass off the scene
Caught that Raekwon, you should stick to the cream
Servin' these niggas like I'm Paula Deen
Blood raw, I don't cook what I eat
Hookshot, bitch, I think I'm Kareem
I don't believe what you say in them beats
They gave you hands and cleats, why you still postin' memes?
Why you ain't grab no beam?
This nigga still on my feed, talkin' what he should've did
Should've-could've-would've ass nigga, why the fuck you ain't it did it?
The way that you talk somebody should be missing, my boy
It ain't real, 'less you can't see that
Uh-uh
You can't be broke and over 30, getting your ass beat where you sleep at
Come on, bro
