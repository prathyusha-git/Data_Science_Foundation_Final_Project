And I know that we just met
I love the way you take it off
When I break down on your ass
And you're taking of the memories we made
I'll hope you take it all with you
I'm a tourist just like you
Did you went into my life for whatever
Forever feeling like you could do better
Better than me, I'm wishing oh T
Wishing you stayed but today is the day that you leave
As you packing your bags I'm watching you leave
Reading back over your letter to me
You got tears in your eyes
You can't hide it from me
Both our noses are running
While fighting to breathe
And I'm looking in the mirror like Mark
Got a cold heart how'd it get this far
How'd it get this hard?
Never letting anybody in
Now you're spilling your feelings all over the car
Europe is feeling like mars
Both of us know that I shoot for the stars
Check through your baggage you're packing a piece of my heart
Knew it was over before it could start
Damn, now all that I see are the memories
That me and you could achieve in a short time
Together a reason to season forever
You came in and left like the weather
Both you and I know less than no better
Remember the moment I met her
Forgive me for making you wait for my letter
I'm writing this song cause I told her
I'd never forget her, and I know
And I know that we just met
But yes, I love the way you take it off
When I break down on your ass
Wanna have it all
And now you're taking of the memories we made
I hope you sail, I hope you take it all with you
I'm a tourist just like you
And I know that we just met
But yes, I love the way you take it off
When I break down on your ass
Wanna have it all
And now you're taking of the memories we made
I hope you sail, I hope you take it all with you
I'm a tourist just like you
And I think I lost me while I try to find you
Remembering back to the night that we met
Came to my show and you stayed for my set
I'm puking and spilling all over my chest
Sometimes I admit I'm a mess
I fuck other rappers, you fuck with the best
Came all by your morals and buying a dress
Came all by your life and the likes on your breasts
I'm fucking impressed, see love is something that's been over my head
Or fuck if I do it again, and me, I'm no more than a tourist supporting a friend
I care 'bout the time that we spend, I don't want to pretend
Trying to find the line that defines that you're more than a friend
It's funny they say times is money, when time is the only thing that we don't spend
I did it again, I build up a wall with a tight rope to my heart
And I hope you don't fall, we've been through it all
I sit here and wait for your call
But settling down I don't think that we're ready at all
I'm busy I'm chasing a passion, looking back
Asking how did this happen and how is it now
That I found all the feelings I'm lacking
A tourist of time and our time isn't lasting
I know that we just met
But yes, I love the way you take it off
When I break down on your ass
Wanna have it all
And now you're taking of the memories we made
I hope you sail, I hope you take it all with you
I'm a tourist just like you
And I know that we just met
But yes, I love the way you take it off
When I break down on your ass
Wanna have it all
And now you're taking of the memories we made
I hope you sail, I hope you take it all with you
I'm a tourist just like you
I don't wanna watch you
Fly away
I don't wanna watch you go
Tell me where you stay
I don't wanna watch you, wanna watch you
Fly away
