We're strong, we're weak, we die
We're straight, we're gay, we're bi
We're black, we're white, but why
To tell the truth, we lie
We get so trapped inside our little lives
They disappear before our very eyes
So come on, live it up tonight
Live it up tonight, move on
It's time we give it up tonight
Live it up tonight, from now on
We loved, we lost, we tried
Do you say I'm fine 'cause I die
I'm so sick and tired of crying
So tonight it's time we just fly
So now we got so caught up in the deal
We lost the only thing we got that's real
So come on, live it up tonight
Live it up tonight, move on
It's time we give it up tonight
Live it up tonight, from now on
♪
We can heal, make it real, can't you feel
Can't you feel, oh
♪
And now it hurts so bad to say goodbye
I know my love for you is still alive
So come on, live it up tonight
Live it up tonight, move on
It's time we give it up tonight
Live it up tonight, from now on
So come on, live it up tonight
Live it up tonight, move on
It's time we give it up tonight
Live it up tonight, from now on
So come on, live it up tonight
Live it up tonight, move on
It's time we give it up tonight
Live it up tonight, from now on
