I fucking came and leave it
Got me spinning game but that ain't me tho
I hit you everyday, I know you read 'em
But sometimes I do the same thing
Gotta let you know, let you know
I don't wanna get too close
Been lying to myself too long
Baby I try, try to act like I don't need you, baby I lie
See the truth is I want you 'cause
I'm tryna be the one, to make you fall
Tryna be the one, to make you fall
Even if I have to push ya, push ya, back (push ya, push ya, back)
Tryna be the one, to make you fall
I tried to die with you bullet
But when it comes to you, shit I couldn't
You're the only one who understands me
Want your love, I need it badly
I can't let you go (let you go)
Don't let you go
Feeling you to say the least
Gotta keep you on a leash
Baby I try, try to act like I don't need you, baby I lie
See the truth is I want you 'cause
I'm tryna be the one, to make you fall
Tryna be the one, to make you fall
Even if I have to push ya, push ya back (push ya, push ya, back)
Tryna be the one, to make you fall

Push ya, push ya, back
