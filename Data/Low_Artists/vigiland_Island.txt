I've gone places where I shouldn't go
I've kissed faces that I don't belong to
I don't belong to the marks that they left on my soul, oh no
I've gone crazy for less, you know
Summer's changing and my heart is open
My heart is open to more than I thought it was capable of
Tide high, feels like we're drownin' 'cause I want more
Hold tight, baby, I'm dyin' to feel like before
I want you to rock this boat
Pull me in nice and slow
Teach me to ride the waves as we go
And I'll be your island
My heart is open
My heart is open
My heart is open to more than I thought it was
My heart is open
My heart is open
My heart is open to more than I, than I, than I

I've seen memories that fill in the sky
I've heard stories that I can't hold on to
I can't hold on to the scars, paint them over in time, oh no
I want you to rock this boat
Pull me in nice and slow
Teach me to ride the waves as we go
And I'll be your island, oh yeah
I'll be your island
And I'll be your island, oh yeah
My heart is open
My heart is open
My heart is open to more than I thought it was
My heart is open
My heart is open
My heart is open to more than I thought that it
