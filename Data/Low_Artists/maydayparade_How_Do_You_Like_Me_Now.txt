So tell me what you think of love, does it look like me?
And when I touch it do you feel the drug?
So put me in my place like I forget (No, no)
Say if I bend, you'll break these walls down love
Everybody knows
I don't wanna die alone, say you'll come for me
But I'm lost and found, I'm already jaded
Say what you think you out loud or forever hold your peace
You can turn your back but the sunset is fading
Say what you think out loud, how do you like me now?
♪
Do you feel the afterglow?
Does is taste like me when your caught up in the undertow?
Try and keep this safe and locked away somewhere below
But everybody knows
I don't wanna die alone, say you'll come for me
But I'm lost and found, I'm already jaded
Say what you think you out loud or forever hold your peace
You can turn your back but the sunset is fading
Say what you think out loud, how do you like me now?
♪
How do you like me now?
Do you like the way it tastes?
Everybody knows
I don't wanna die alone, say you'll come for me
But I'm lost and found, I'm already jaded
Say what you think you out loud or forever hold your peace
You can turn your back but the sunset is fading
Say what you think out loud, how do you like me now?
That hand you hold is letting go
The sunset is fading
So how do you like me now?
