What do you mean I'll never change? (I need you, I love you)
I'm begging you one more chance (I need you, I love you)

But who's to see who's right or wrong? (I need you, I love you)
No, you better see now, all my love's soon gone (I need you, I love you)
(We both) do so many crazy things (I need you, I love you)
Always hurt one another without no reason (I need you, I love you)
(Didn't leave) when I said I loved you (I need you, I love you)
'Cause my love's too short (for us to argue) (I need you, I love you)
I really love you (she loves me, she loves me not)
Do anything for you
I'd do anything, I'd do anything (she loves me, she loves me not)
I really love you (she loves me, she loves me not)
Do anything for you
