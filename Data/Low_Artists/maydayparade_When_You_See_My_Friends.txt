I'm burned out like a bright light
I wasn't ready for this
You're adorable as hell, but I'm glancing at your wrist
Oh, please have faith
I can be so cavalier
And when they start to ask questions
I'll make sure to be clear
When you see my friends, tell 'em "Hi" for me
Tell 'em what you think about the way you handled everything
You turned and all you left me with was this broken key
So tell me what you think
♪
And give it up for the long nights
And all those terrible fights
Were you honest with yourself, every version of yourself?
Did you get lost on the side of the road?
If you keep acting this way, I swear I'll never come home
When you see my friends, tell 'em "Hi" for me
Tell 'em what you think about the way you handled everything
We walk alone on this broken road for eternity
So give me company and help me sing this lonely melody
You turned and all you left me with was this broken key
So tell me what you think
♪
Sign me up, no regrets, make a man out of me
And I won't say a word
And I'll give all the things that you want and I need
Just to give me some peace
At the bottom of the ocean there's a place for you and me
Lead the way straight ahead
You gave me the time of my life
And it cut like a knife to the bone
When you see my friends, tell them "Hi" for me
And tell them what you think about the way you handled everything
So neat and clean well the world is filled with such pretty things
So do your best for me
