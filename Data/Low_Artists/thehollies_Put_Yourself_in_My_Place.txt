(Ransford)
So you gotta put yourself in my place
I don't want to lose face
People talking 'round town
Telling me that you've been putting it round
That your love for me
So they say
It's hard to realize
That I love you this way
So you gotta put yourself in my place
Don't want to lose face
Coz you're telling these lies
Everyone will think it's no surprise
That you're leaving me today
I never thought that I'd see you walking away
So you gotta put yourself in my place
Don't want to lose face
So your friends turn their backs
And laugh at me
Well you just tell them
That our love could never be
And so you gotta now
Put yourself in my place
Break
So you gotta now
Put yourself in my place
Don't want to lose face
Why don't we both take a chance
I'm sure that if we tried we could save our romance
I'll never understand what you did to me
Why don't you realize that I'll never be free
And so you gotta
Put yourself in my place
Don't want to lose face
No no no no no no (lose face)
Listen to me baby (lose face)
Come on Come on
You gotta try
Lose face
