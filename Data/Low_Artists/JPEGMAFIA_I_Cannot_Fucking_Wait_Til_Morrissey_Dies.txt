I do it, I do it
I do what matter to me, dawg
Tom, Varg, Morrissey
Bunch of timid white - who can't fuck with me
My daddy told me these white - can't keep a key
Fifth in his face, got him singing C (damn)
Never (woo) mind, you or me (okay)
Fuck a Johnny Rotten, I want Lil' B
Fuck you niggas talking, this a killing spree (dang)
Pull up on a cracker bumpin' Lil' Peep
God (God) damn (damn), holy sheep
Got my reparations, bought some jewelry (yo)
I'm a left-wing Hades, twenty-six with a fresh .380
We gon' show you exactly how we do it
Down in the country, baby
This Alabama though, huh
Watch make you look cock-eyed
Racks make you walk wop-sided
And you know I rock real diamonds
You ain't even gotta look at 'em
- On my dick 'cause I'm edgy
Sit your pale ass down, have a Pepsi
I'm way past flexing
Feel the dab in my chest, this is venting

Now maybe I'm - (okay)
