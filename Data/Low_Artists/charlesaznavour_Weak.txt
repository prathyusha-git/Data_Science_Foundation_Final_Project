I wonder if he knows that you can't stand the color blue
Or you love yellow like a signal off of parachutes
I hate how everyone I meet now, I compare to you
To keep it real, I always thought that I would marry you
I wonder if he noticed that you're not a fan of roses
That's why I always bought you lilies, bet you didn't notice
He loves you at your high, but me, I loved you at your lowest
And even though it's over, grateful that we had our moment
I wonder if he knows you really don't believe in luck
And since your parents split, you really don't believe in love
I wish that you believed in me like I believed in us
Heard through the grapevine he gets jealous when you bring me up
I wonder if he knows he found himself a queen now
See you been takin' him to all the spots that we found
I see your posts and you look happy as can be now
You only know if that's for show or how you're feelin' deep down, damn
Oh, I'm weak to my knees
I find it hard just to breathe
Knowin' you could just leave
You said you'd never let go, you'd never leave me
You'd never leave me, you'd never leave me weak
I wonder if you leave your lashes on his bathroom counter
Remember how we used to stay up, and would talk for hours?
Does he know that you showed him all the songs you said were ours?
And that your favorite time to sing is when you're in the shower?
I wonder if you like the fact that he is nothin' like me
I feel too deep, just like you always said, I'm such a Pisces
Guess you meant nothin' in those letters that you used to write me
Followed my heart because you always said to let it guide me
I wonder if he knows how bad you wanna visit London
Damn, is this really who one day you're gonna call your husband?
I wish you loved me in the ways that now you say you love him
Yeah, I admit, I'm envious, and really wish I wasn't
I wonder if it would've worked if the timin' was different
See, since you left, it always feels like there's somethin' that's missin'
Does he care more about your passion or favorite position?
Or would you rather never ask him to ponder the difference?
Last time we talked, your mom was workin' hard at stayin' sober
Still hope that you and her are workin' on becomin' closer
Sometimes it's hard to just accept that you and I are over
I guess I wrote this more for me because I needed closure
I wonder if you ever wonder if I'm doin' fine
Or if you ever have those moments where I cross your mind
See, time itself, it doesn't heal, you heal yourself with time
I've just become another someone that you left behind, damn
Oh, I'm weak to my knees
I find it hard just to breathe
Knowin' you could just leave
You said you'd never let go, you'd never leave me
You'd never leave me, you'd never leave me weak (leave me weak, leave me weak)
