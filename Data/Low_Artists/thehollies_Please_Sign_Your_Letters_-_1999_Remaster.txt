Please sign your letters
Please don't make me blue
Please sign your letters
And then I'll know it's you
Can't stop thinkin' of you
You're always on my mind
Please sign your letters
Please don't be unkind
I read your letter
I read most every line
You said, you loved me
Said, you would be mine
My heart was jumpin'
Somethin' smy mind
I found your letter
Was left unsigned
Please sign your letters
Please don't make me blue
Please sign your letters
And then I'll know it's you
Can't stop thinkin' of you
You're always on my mind
Please sign your letters
Please don't be unkind
Your letter said,? We'd met some time ago
I'd like to see you?
But somehow you just won't show
I just don't know which way to go
