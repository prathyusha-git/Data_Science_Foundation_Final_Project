Right love, the wrong attention,
Some things will never change
I'll keep my soul if you can promise the same
Someday I'll fly away
Count down from ten for a brand new day
This year is over and I'm feeling like a rolling stone
One mistake at a time
Until you learn to keep it all condensed
And buried deep inside
It hurts a little before it gets better in time
My heart is only my mind
Oh and now it's gone
Oh there's gotta be a better way to show what I'm feeling
All for a name I wont ever say.
I miss the glamour of your camera flash
You're gonna need it when the lights go down
Let go and make believe
We're singing in the streets
You're only happy you're making a scene
Oh that's just fine with me
I never wanted to disagree
This year is over and im feeling just as dirty again
That's okay, bide your time
'Cause you're never gonna see
Another morning without me
You're just a little, oh you'e just a little
Too shy
I think I will be alright
Now here I go
Oh there's gotta be a better way to show what I'm feeling
All for a name I wont ever say.
I miss the glamour of your camera flash
You're gonna need it when the lights go down

Oh there's gotta be a better way to show what I'm feeling
All for a name I wont ever say.
I miss the glamour of your camera flash
I only need it when I'm coming down
I'm starting to think I'm crazy
Every day after New Years
She says "I need those cordial stars "
I miss the glamour of your camera flash
You're gonna need it when the lights go down
