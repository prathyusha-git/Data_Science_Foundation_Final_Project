That's a lie, lie, lie, yeah
I've been lyin' so much I don't know what to believe
I'd be lyin' if I said this meant nothing to me
A true DIY pioneer here, what the fuck do you mean?
So you sign a deal, now you just puppet to be
So you stealing ideas? So you stealing from me
I put my time into my music, not a song every week
The deeper the trench, the higher the peak
I got to document my lines before you rappers comin' stealin' from me, haha
And they say people lie, numbers don't
Put myself as a wallpaper on my own phone
To remember who was there when I'm looking for a loan
Well, I'm lookin' for some help, now nobody gotta phone, huh?
You were lyin' when you said you weren't lyin'
Every lie's another step to the fact I'm goodbyin'
Dodge a bullet when you left, yes, I'm off a good time
And I hear every single truth in your silence, yeah
Don't you tell me that you love me when I know you fuckin' don't
That's a lie, lie, lie, yeah
Don't you tell me that you're sorry when you knew what you was doin'
That's a lie, lie, lie, yeah
Don't you tell me that you're busy when you really chilling, oh
That's a lie, lie, lie, yeah
Don't you tell me that you're here when you already been gone
That's a lie, lie, lie, yeah
Go ahead and hurt me with the truth
I would rather have that than feel good about a lie
All I wanted is for us to have trust, but you gave it all up
'Cause you couldn't stop lyin'
You were lyin' when you said I wouldn't make it, you were way off
I would be fucking lyin' if I said I took a day off
They talk about the money that they have 'til they pay off
I got a couple loans and bills to pay off, damn
Well, I was on you Instagram last night
Saw 100k followers, only had 11 likes
Guess the numbers do lie when you pay the right price
Couple pictures of your ass like, "My hair looks nice, huh?"
You're online and hopin' people wanna be you
Without your hair and makeup, won't let anybody see you
What's funny is the fact that you don't even wanna be you
Wasn't lying when I said I didn't need you, yeah
Don't you tell me that you love me when I know you fuckin' don't
That's a lie, lie, lie, yeah
Don't you tell me that you're sorry when you knew what you was doin'
That's a lie, lie, lie, yeah
Don't you tell me that you're busy when you really chilling, oh
That's a lie, lie, lie, yeah
Don't you tell me that you're here when you already been gone
That's a lie, lie, lie, yeah
I don't believe you
You told me listen but, no, I don't need to
Bitch, you were evil
You nothing to me, that's easy to see through
No I don't need you
All that you brought me was problems on problems
You need to be remote
And live where you left me—that's right at the bottom, yeah
You lyin' if you say that you ain't a liar, I swear
Tryna convince me that I'm tripping, it's all in my head
I don't be trusting, your name isn't even what you said
'Cause you a lyin' ass bitch, so please don't call me up again
Don't you tell me that you love me when I know you fuckin' don't
That's a lie, lie, lie, yeah
Don't you tell me that you're sorry when you knew what you was doin'
That's a lie, lie, lie, yeah
Don't you tell me that you're busy when you really chilling, oh
That's a lie, lie, lie, yeah
Don't you tell me that you're here when you already been gone
That's a lie, lie, lie, yeah
