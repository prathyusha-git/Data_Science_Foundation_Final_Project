Sometimes they will leave you
Regardless of what you believe,
There are some things that are bound to change
♪
No, I don't want your lies,
There's nowhere to hide
No, I don't want your tears,
There's no room to cry
Some say it gets easier,
But it feels like no one understands,
And some days you keep calling me up,
To say your mind has changed
No, I don't want your lies,
There's nowhere to hide,
I'm telling you no,
I don't want your tears,
There's no room to cry
I don't want your tears,
I don't want your lies,
So don't waste your time
'Cause I won't spend mine flicking switches,
When every single fuse is blown
'Cause here in the dark,
I can finally see you for what you are
No, I don't want your lies,
There's nowhere to hide,
I'm telling you no,
I don't want your tears,
There's no room to cry
No, I don't want your tears
There's no room to cry
There's no room to cry
