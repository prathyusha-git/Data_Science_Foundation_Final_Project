Oh no, I think I did it once again
And will they find me out?
This time is different than the last
If I can just rewind the time it takes to undo all I've chased
I can bring it back again and through her eyes I see the light
And oh, there's a plan for me I've seen it before
Through the crack of an unlocked door
Just a glimpse but I saw it still
I couldn't tell you there's a monster for all, oh
And please, if you don't want me to stay
Then there's nothing left to say
I promise I'll go back again and make things right this time
And if you believe in me, then stand and fight
♪
Stay a while, and try to analyze my brain
Describing all the quotes you say
Will help forget mistakes I've made
I could bring it back again and through her eyes I see the light
And oh, there's a plan for me I've seen it before
Through the crack of an unlocked door
Just a glimpse but I saw it still
I couldn't tell you there's a monster for all, oh
And please, if you don't want me to stay
Then there's nothing left to say
I promise I'll go back again and make things right this time
And if you believe in me, then stand and
Find a way, make it through okay
All your happy days are gone
And all I'm saying is
You're not ready, you're not ready
