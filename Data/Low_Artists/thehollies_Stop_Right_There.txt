(Hicks / Clarke / Nash)
And the power you have over
won't ever let me be
It's always holding me to you
And the strange things you say to me
Why do you play with me
It's just too sad to see
Stop right there
Tell me what you're doing to my mind in there
Tell me what you're doing Am I blind
Long ago everything about you was for me to hold
Now my thoughts about you won't stay cold
And in time I might slip away
into the light of day
But with you I must stay it's true
Wishful thinking will just bring me down
It's plain to see you own
the ground I'm standing on
chorus
verse 2
