Yeah
Your ex he cheated on you
My ex she cheated on me
Want to say thank you to them
They gave us reasons to leave
Lost faith in falling in love
You came and made me believe
I've got hurt in my heart, deep
You'd have to fucking rip it out to see I'm insecure
I can't stop obsessing on my successes
No matter what I do I just never could see my blessings
So every conversation you try to gage where my head is
Cause it never seems to be on the top
And we're dissecting
We're spending our time on everything other than me and you
When I start to feel the pressure
You feel the pressure times two
We fight, you start to cry
I feel like I'm coming unglued
I walk away when really all I want to say is that I love you
Once again my stubbornness has got the best of me
When I want to get under your skin, I know the recipe
We're on the same team
Don't need to treat you like the enemy
I tell you that I'm fine
That's when you say you're testing me, I know you're testing me
I, I should probably let you in but I don't know how
I should probably let you win but I can't back down
I don't want you to leave and I tell you to go
We've been at it all day with our backs to the rope
I would always start a fight and I don't know why
I would probably say your right if I saw your side
I don't want you to leave and I tell you to go
We've been at it all day with our backs to the rope
You tell me, Mark, shut up, just let it go
So immaterial this stupid shit you fight me for
I know you're right but I'm too proud to ever let you know
Surrounded by a million people
Only feel like when you're there is when I'm not alone
Get off your fucking phone you say, you're rude for no reason
I want to tell you that I'm sorry
Yah, I tell you I'm leaving
You say you love the real me, even when I don't believe it
I said some shit I didn't mean
You say, why don't you repeat it, motherfucker
Now why don't you think about what you said
Instead of saying I love you, I'm going out with my friends
Instead of saying I love you, I say I'm going to bed
I hate the fact that they're sad so the battles
Inside your head killing my egos become bigger than my heart
I wanna end this fucking fight, it's just I don't know where to start
So you don't treat me like a product, you appreciate the art
I want you to know I care about you and it's easy and it's hard
I know it's hard but
If everything were to crash
I wouldn't give a single second that I spent with you back
So you make me a better me, you're everything that I lack
I'd give you the sun and the stars but all I have is this track
I should probably let you in but I don't know how
I should probably let you win but I can't back down
I don't want you to leave and I tell you to go
We've been at it all day with our backs to the rope
I would always start a fight and I don't know why
I would probably say your right if I saw your side
I don't want you to leave and I tell you to go
We've been at it all day with our backs to the rope
