Yeah! I don't fit in boxes and your categories
You won't find realer, or the next us
"The chosen one", might get it tatted on me
You passed on me, better fess up
On my worst day, could make your best stuff
All my worst stuff could be your best-of
And you're running mouth, better rest up
There's a couple of things I kept pent up, uh!
I've been alone in my room with nobody around
Just to gather my thoughts, yeah
Your album is charting, not a surprise
Don't tell me how many you bought, yeah
You met with the label one time
And you posting some pictures, I see your facade, yeah
I met with some labels, no pictures from me
I paint pictures with words when I talk
People talkin', I got no time to listen
You're tryin' to be different, that makes you not different
They say I just rap about women
That's coming from lames who just never get women, the best is a given
Y'all average
Honestly, for a second I forgot I was a savage
Took passion, something all of y'all lacking
Been asking, "Is anybody not acting?"
'Cause I know I'm the only one
I know, I know I'm the only one
We have a lot to cheer, so they pour me one
Only one can judge, that's the holy one, yeah
I can see blood in the water, I don't want none of you fishin'
I can sing anything honest, I don't want none of your business
Fuck with my vision, I can see 'em all over my hit-list
I can see you're all over my wishlist, I can see it all now
I can see blood in the water, I don't want none of you fishin'
I can sing anything honest, I don't want none of your business
Fuck with my vision, I can see 'em all over my hit-list
I can see you're all over my wishlist, I can see it all now
Now let's keep it honest, who'd you copy after?
Erase your socials, I own my masters
I'm a trendsetter to you trendy rappers
I would mumble too, if I was rappin' backwards
I would mumble too, if I was just a puppet
Talkin' 'bout my dick and how these bitches love it
Never had a filter, never one to fuck with
Told me turn my sound, now it's buzzing
I was taking back, told 'em, "Fuck that!"
They're in love with money, they don't love rap
Tried to show love, get no love back
Never play me, that's a fun fact
And your album sounded like one track
I don't see a ceiling, I'm above that
Wanna see me fall, they would love that
Is anybody else bringin' love back, uh
No, I'm the only one
I know, I know I'm the only one
We have a lot to cheer, so they pour me one
Only one can judge, that's the holy one, yeah!
I can see blood in the water, I don't want none of you fishin'
I can sing anything honest, I don't want none of your business
Fuck with my vision, I can see 'em all over my hit-list
I can see you're all over my wishlist, I can see it all now
I can see blood in the water, I don't want none of you fishin'
I can sing anything honest, I don't want none of your business
Fuck with my vision, I can see 'em all over my hit-list
I can see you're all over my wishlist, I can see it all now
Opinions from people that never get it
You buy every lie that they're sellin' to you
You stole my style, never gave me credit
You would buy my story, if I'd sell it to you
Remember back, I was surfing couches
My new estate got a fuckin' fountain
A middle finger for a fucking doubt
Keep it deep enough to watch ya fuckin' drownin' now
I can see blood in the water, I don't want none of you fishin'
I can sing anything honest, I don't want none of your business
Fuck with my vision, I can see 'em all over my hit-list
I can see you're all over my wishlist, I can see it all now
I can see blood in the water, I don't want none of you fishin'
I can sing anything honest, I don't want none of your business
Fuck with my vision, I can see 'em all over my hit-list
I can see you're all over my wishlist, I can see it all now
