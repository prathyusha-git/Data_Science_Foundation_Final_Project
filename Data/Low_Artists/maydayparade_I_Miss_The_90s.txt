There's a part of me
That misses fireworks and rainy days
It's got room to breathe
But it's still suffocating
Well, it feels like I should be the one
Holding on to something good
For the friends we don't see anymore
And the broken hearts that did all they could
You piled it up last May
Struck a single match and walked away
There goes everything
That's how a good life looks burning
Well, I don't say never anymore
Knowing nothing lasts or stays
As I disappear and float away
God, I miss the '90s, we had it made
