There's a man I know with no expression no not none at all
Have you ever ridden horses through a rainstorm
or led a lion through a busy street bazaar
There are many things I'd like to turn you on to
but somehow I feel you're safer where you are
If you're looking for examples to refer to
take a look around yourself I'm sure you'll find
there are many things to make your life much brighter
and I'd bet there's many more inside your mind
There's a man I know with no expression no not none at all
There's a man I know with no expression no not none at all
But I've never seen this man laughing
and come to think of it I've never seen him cry
But I might by sitting hear him singing
By and by he'll stop and sigh
he'll feel a breeze and then begin to freeze
as he thinks goodbye
Have you ever ridden horses through a rainstorm
or led a lion through a busy street bazaar
There are many things I'd like to turn you on to
but somehow I feel you're safer where you are
There's a man I know with no expression no not none at all
There's a man with no expression
man with no expression
man with no expression
