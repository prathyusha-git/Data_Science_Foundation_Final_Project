I'd be a fool not to realize
Just how much I needed your love
I'd be a fool not to realize
I'm the guy you're thinkin' of, whoa
I don't want nobody new
In future, baby, I'm gonna be true to you
What kind of boy do you think I am?
I'd give you love and ecstasy
I ain't ever gonna break your heart
And you know, and you know
When I hold you close to me
You know it starts to tear me apart, whoa
What kind of boy do you think I'd be
If I let other girls kiss on me?
Oh, can't you see?
What kind of boy do you think I am?
Here in your arms I wanna be, little girl
You give your love so tenderly
I'd give you love and ecstasy
I ain't ever gonna break your heart
And you know, and you know
When I hold you close to me
You know it starts to tear me apart, whoa
What kind of boy do you think I'd be
If I let other girls kiss on me?
Oh, can't you see?
What kind of boy do you think I am?
What kind of boy do you think I am?
What kind of boy do you think I am?
What kind of boy do you think I am?
