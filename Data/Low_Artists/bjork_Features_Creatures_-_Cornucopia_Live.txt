When I spot someone who is same height as you
Goes to same record stores
I literally think I am five minutes away from love
Isn't it odd?
Isn't it peculiar?
These statistics of my mind
Shuffling your features
Assembling a man
Googling love
Warming my heart on this log fire of love
Features creatures
Features creatures
