And we on...
Welcome to the 27 club
And if I die before I wake, yeah
At the 27 club
I pray the Lord my soul to take
Welcome to the 27 club
And if I die before I wake, yeah
To the 27
I'm Jimi Hendrix, baby, I'm Jimi Hendrix
Throw that pussy at me, I'ma take it if you lendin'
Party hardly, never talk cop
And my tracks make these white hoes strip
Nigga, dead-ass, I love rap but I never buy the music
I just download it for free, then I talk shit
Rhymin's easy, anyone can do it
That's why I say fuck that new, I want that old shit
I'm all indie, baby, I love garbage
Sling out wack tracks and Pitchfork loves it
Critic-core legend, certified bitch-made
Asshole niggas, thinkin' they got the best taste
At 27, I'ma asphyxiate on my own bullshit
While I'm lookin' for a fix
So fuck a black fan, crackers make figures
'Cause God don't like ugly and no one likes niggas
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
And If I stunt before I front
I pray the Lord just give me what I want
And If I flash before that cash
I pray the Lord give me all of that
And if I ain't rich before 26, well, fuck (uh)
I hope they let me in the 27 club
I'm Janis Joplin, I sing like an old time slave
And I look twice my age
Live from summertime, a OG vulture
Mother-fuck a spook, I'ma profit off the culture
Real nigga lover, I used to play the backroom
Trouble on my mind, I fuck hippies in the bathroom
Big Momma Thorton my ball and chain
Bitch, I'ma do you like Elvis did, never get credited
Overdose on sedatives and heroin and medicine
Oppressed white female, I'm a mother-fucking feminist
Mirror, mirror on the wall, tell me who I'm better than
Bitch, you not heaven-sent, a thief is all you ever been
On the road to riches, they gon' catch me out my element
But if I play the victim, they gon' treat me like a veteran
Pot kettle rhetoric, vocal chords need severin'
I never had an original bone in my skeleton
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
And if I stunt before I front
I pray the Lord just give me what I want
And if I flash before that cash
I pray the Lord give me all of that
And if I ain't rich before 26, well, fuck
I hope they let me in the 27 club (uh)
They call me Kurt Cobain, I don't like fame
I strum guitars, I snort cocaine
I am one fucked-up nigga
The Earth is my bedroom, the sky is my mirror
And I look up in that bitch like er'day
Smile to myself and thank God I'm paid
'Cause I could be like you, a keyboard warrior
YouTube confessin' in the comment section
Dick gettin' hard off a thumbs up blessin'
And when you get ignored
It's like, "Fuck, now I'm stressin'!"
I took the high road
Instead of bein' the nigga that talk shit
I'd rather be the nigga that walks it
Hop, skip and jump 'cause I'm rich as hell
Stick to the script like an actor
But I don't play no roles, I'm hip-hop's Death Note
I'm killin' off every single fuckin' blog rapper, bitch
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
And if I stunt before I front
I pray the Lord just give me what I want
And if I flash before that cash
I pray the Lord give me all of that
And if I ain't rich before 26, well, fuck
I hope they let me in the 27 club

Alright, here, then I walk into it, like, as the slums go
Then keep it straight up there and then-
Yep
