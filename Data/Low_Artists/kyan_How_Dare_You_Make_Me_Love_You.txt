When the dust had settled
And the flames were gone
I found myself here standing alone
I thought we'd stay together
Like we've always done
When did you stop believing?
Or did you know from the start that I wasn't the one?
Oh-oh-oh
How dare you make me love you, no
Was it always the plan to leave with my heart in your hand?
How dare you make me love you
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
♪
After all the filler
And temporary love
We were heads and shoulders above
I know that I'm not perfect
But I never was
So when did you stop believing?
Or did you know from the start that I wasn't enough?
Whoa-oh-oh
How dare you make me love you, no
Was it always the plan to leave with my heart in your hand? No-o
How dare you make me love you
I've tried but I don't understand
I gave you the best that I can, oh
No, no, no, no
