Oh, yeah!
Oh, oh, yeah!
Oh, oh, yeah!
Oh, oh, yeah!
Oh, oh, yeah!
Oh, oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, oh, yeah!
Oh-
I should've held my tongue
I shouldn't have kept it going
I want a love like water through me
I should've poured my honey slowly
Wash it away, my Rorschach, Rorschach
Wash it away, my Rorschach, Rorschach
Like hell, my hands will give up to 20 times
Hm, my heart will give up too many times
Luck's fallen, I've seen it, my intrusion, there's a limit
I can take, and I'm crawling out, hm-hm, hm-hm
I'm a loner, I'm a loser, stuck at home
I'm above it, I'm a winner, on my own
For silence, for silence, I want you back in my head
For silence, for silence, I want you back in my bed (oh, yeah! Oh-)
Fuck out the deep end, go get you a float
Y'all niggas always be doin' the most
Black Michael Phelps, just acknowledge the stroke
God-level Libra, I swim with a ghost
I switched the channel, then lost the remote
She for the world, she belongs to the globe
Gaslighting's popular, learn how to cope
Actin' like hoes, I throw these bands
She hit the floor, let's get it
Everyday people pushin' past the limit
Men only know suppressin' what they feeling
I used to work for pennies on the minute
Hunger from struggle, stayed up 'cause I live it
Worked on my muscle, flex on all you bitches
I can't defend this bitch up in the mirror
I'd rather ask forgiveness than permission
Undo the cap, you can't restore the feeling
I'll never chill 'cause y'all really want a nigga broke, like
Fuck the excuses, but y'all really eat off the toxic narratives and jokes, like
Friends, they pass, and some opportunities never come back
If I don't know nothing, know one thing is set
Never react to the demographic
With the swag of a cashier at Radio Shack
Talkin' to 'Zel like, "When we start runnin', we ain't finna look back"
You niggas makin' it trendy to trauma bond
Self-oppression, it's deeper than rap (uh)
I'm not afraid for my life
I'm not afraid for my life
I'm not afraid for my life
I'm not afraid for my life
I'm not afr-
