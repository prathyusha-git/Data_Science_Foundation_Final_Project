He turned me down
I then downturned another
Who then downturned her
The paralyzing juice of rejection
His veins full of lead
He's left with loving what he lost
More than what he has
♪
My snake skin cold in the dark
But warms up in the light
I then upturned a green-eyed giant
Who upturned and entered me
Will we stop seeing what unites us
But only what differs?
Mm, the ghosts of old loves
Hovering around his orifices, his orifices
♪
As you narrate your own heart tale
You thread souls into one beam
The love you gave, and have been given
Weave into your own dream
I trust my cells to re-archive
My love historic stream
