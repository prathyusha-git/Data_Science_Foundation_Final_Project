Baby girl, you're so fine
So, so fine, you blow my mind
Look at you, coochie coo
Juicy, tushy, gushy, goo
Boobie one, boobie two
Bouncing like a Looney Tune
Booty booming, cookie juice
Gushing out your coochie, boo
You're so cute like Pikachu
Ain't no one so sweet like you
I whistle then you sneak into
My lonely heart like peek-a-boo
Now every time I think of you
Not by my side I dry my eyes
I just wanna sing lullabies
To my little butterfly
