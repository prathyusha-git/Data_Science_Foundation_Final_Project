You read the stars everyday in the paper
And believe every word they say
You want to know if I'll always love you
But I can't see tomorrow today
So, I can't guarante a happy ending
The story is always unwinding
But right here and now it doesn't matter
'Cause we're having a good time
Having a good time
You know that I'm no fortune teller
I can't predict how it will be
You need a love that lasts forever
That far ahead
I just can't see
So, I can't guarantee a happy ending
I don't know what might've happen
But this me and you in this situation
Are you having a good time?
If everything's perfect
What more could we ask for?
We're here and now
Are you having a good time?
You're somewhere off into the future
Imagining how it will look
Will we last another chapter?
Can we make it last 'til the end of the book?
So, I can't guarantee a happy ending
The story is always unwinding
But right here and now it doesn't matter
'Cause we're having a good time
So, I can't guarantee a happy ending
I don't know what might've happen
But this me and you in this situation
Are you having a good time?
So, I can't guarantee a happy ending...
