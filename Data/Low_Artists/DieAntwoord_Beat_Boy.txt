Straining your brain like tv static
Check out the phunky 3D grafix
Rave visuals, enter my digital zone
As I recite a poem on the microphone
I'm scoping, third eye strobing
Mind open, sweat streaming
Flesh gleaming, best feeling
High-energy peaking, deep meanings
Freak when I see things
Like this chick in a G-string
Can I touch you, friend?

Yo pump it uh, lick it, dip it, twist it, turn it
Pump it, uh, yo, pump it, uh, uh
Lick it, dip it, twist it, turn it, pump it, pump it
I think about you when I masturbate
You can't even believe it but that's okay
On the microphone I fascinate
When I let my third eye exaggerate
Freaky visions, I tell you what I see
Cold concrete scattered with dry leaves
You naked, lying on the pavement
People are standing round with laany shoes
You can hardly move, you look sexy
All of a sudden, the streets are empty
You stand up, open your eye-lids
You in a trench coat, it's french, you look stylish
You walk in the silence, not sure what the time is
It's totally twilight, the sky is violet
An abandoned house, look ahead you see
Some open the door, yes, it's me
With the meanest penis you ever seen
You on your period with no tampon
You kneel down and get with the vibe
Your period blood has crystallized
You offer me the red crystal, it's ill
Grab hold of the mic tight, tonight's the night
The vibe is live, pump up the base
I got tentacles coming out my face
I rise into the air, cut myself open
Warm blood pours down all round
I speak from the deep cut in between my thighs
You covered in blood rubbing your boobs, feeling nice
Rubbing your boobs, feeling nice
Rubbing your boobs, feeling nice
Rubbing your boobs, feeling nice
You covered in blood rubbing your boobs, feeling nice
Beat boy, beat boy
Hit that perfect, beat boy
Hit that perfect, hit that perfect
Hit that perfect, beat boy
Beat boy, beat boy
Hit that perfect, beat boy
Hit that perfect, hit that perfect
Hit that perfect, beat boy
Pump it, uh, yo, pump it, uh, uh
Yo pump it uh, lick it, dip it, twist it, turn it
Pump it, uh, yo, pump it, uh, uh
Lick it, dip it, twist it, turn it, pump it, pump it
You open the door, step into the place
Look around, strange painting on the walls
A chick on the floor on all fours, totally nude
In high heels, the vibes ill
She's hand-cuffed, ankle cuffed, steel collar
With a long lease attached to the ceiling
The scene's appealing, revealing weird feelings
Make you forget about what you believing
Another chick chilling against the wall
Flashing her boobs, legs spread with a nice vagina
And a long stick, there's a nice big
Painting above her head, expensive
You check another chick on all fours
Chilling next to another chick lying on the floor
Legs spread in the middle of the corridor
Close shave, don't touch what you can't afford
The next-room's a bed room, you become two
What I mean is, you plus another you
You get down with yourself while I watch
Body buzzing like a bed of a billion bees
You kneel down in front of the other you
Time to learn something new
The one kneeling is a slave, kneel for the master
Feel the warm hand on the back of your head
You got a tattoo on the back of your neck
An infinity sign that represents your past
Your master touches you on your tattoo
And removes your tattoo, now you brand new
I'm proud of you, dear
There's nothing you not allowed to do here
Listen to me, the infinity tattoo is a key
Let go to my rhyme and open your mind
Let go to my rhyme and open your mind
Open your mind, open your mind
Beat boy, beat boy
Hit that perfect, beat boy
Hit that perfect, hit that perfect
Hit that perfect, beat boy
Beat boy, beat boy
Hit that perfect, beat boy
Hit that perfect, hit that perfect
Hit that perfect, beat boy
Pump it, uh, yo, pump it, uh, uh
Yo pump it, uh, lick it, dip it, twist it, turn it
Pump it, uh, yo, pump it, uh, uh
Lick it, dip it, twist it, turn it, pump it, pump it
Lift up your dress, open up your legs
Your vaginas sewn up, untie the thread
My sublime rhyme inside your head
Your mind is rushing, vagina gushing
Another chick in the corner taking a piss
It looks nice, the whole vibe is totally kinky
Look around, the new room is fancy
Remove your fur coat, remove your panties
I'm rocking a suit and a black face mask
I ejaculate in champagne glass
Your precious flesh is so mysterious
Pierce your nipples with two long needles
Like a crucifix, take you to another level
While I get my freak on, the vibe is mental
Transcendental, we somewhere else now
Still rocking a mask but I've taken off my suit
You rocking a mask too, shaking your nice boobs
I tell you I like you, you feel my piel
We start french kissing with flipping long tongues
We somewhere else now, you dressed conservative
I transform into a big black god
Feel the realness, my dick's lank hard
You can't believe it, a dick in your palm
As big as your arm, we somewhere else now
A hospital uh, get ready for the operation
Lot of guys chilling behind you
Blasts from the past
All rocking a mask, penises out
Drop your panties for the surgeon
I'm not a virgin, it's not a problem
Look in the mirror, you can see it's you
You got two nice boobs and a penis too
Look in the mirror, look in the mirror
Look in the mirror, you can see it's you
Look in the mirror, you can see it's you
You got two nice boobs and a penis too
Look in the mirror, look in the mirror
Look in the mirror, you can see it's you
Look in the mirror, you can see it's you
You got two nice boobs and a penis too
Beat boy, beat boy
Hit that perfect, beat boy
Hit that perfect, hit that perfect
Hit that perfect, beat boy
Beat boy, beat boy
Hit that perfect, beat boy
Hit that perfect, hit that perfect
Hit that perfect, beat boy
Pump it, uh, yo, pump it, uh, uh
Yo pump it, uh, lick it, dip it, twist it, turn it
Pump it, uh, yo, pump it, uh, uh
Lick it, dip it, twist it, turn it, pump it, pump it
The men in the masks gather around the patient
Waiting in anticipation
The old surgeon says, can you see this?
A beautiful woman with a brand new penis
You clap the surgeon, flip him right around
Bend him over, lift his white gown
Grap the surgeon's milky butt-cheeks
Rape the surgeon, break the surgeon
Absorb you penis into your tummy
You a woman again, complete with a vagina
I'm flipping my rhyme uh, tripping your mind out
Ripping and vipping your pip, flip it inside-out
Now you the teacher, you the guide
The real you won't see you denied
You got crazy sex appeal, all tied up
Kneeling on the pavement, you can't say shit
Your mouth is gagged, you surrounded by
A thousand guys totally under your spell
They all totally scared of the power you hold
You can changed the rules of the game
And devour their souls
Now's the time, girl
Let's head back into the outside world
The world of others, it's time to go back
The doors are stuck shut
But the walls are beginning to crack
Uh, now the walls are bleeding
It's all deceiving, you soaking wet
With no regrets, feel your body sweat blood
Peel off your old skin, time to get love
You arrive at the cemetery in time for the ceremony
I give you a hot kiss, grab hold of your ass cheeks
How'd you like to get laid on this
Tomb stone in the middle of the rain forest
My gaze puts you in a dase, I'm loving your long tongue
Look at your beautiful face, covered in hot come
Spread my wings block out the sun
Lie on my back, scope out your bum
My penis stays hard, you breathing heavily
I penetrate you, the feeling's heavenly
Now bounce, girl, you know it's hot
Bounce, bounce, girl, like, oh my god
Totally freaky deaky phunky
What make you leave your body
Transport you to another dimension
You alone in the desert, totally nude
The silence is violent
You floating above the ground
Invisible energies penetrate
Every hole in your body while you levitate
You start coming apart, shape-shifting
Wild, out of control
