Moments of clarity are so rare
I better document this
At last, the view is fierce
All that matters is
Who is open chested
And who has coagulated
Who can share
And who has shut down the chances
Show me emotional respect, respect, respect
I have emotional needs, oh, needs, ooh
♪
I wish to synchronize our feelings, our feelings, our hoo-ooh
What is it that I have
That makes me feel your pain?
Like milking a stone
To get you to say it
Who is open
And who has shut up
And if one feels closed
Oh, how does one stay open?
We have emotional needs, oh, needs, oh, needs, ooh
I wish to synchronize our feelings, our feelings, ooh
Oh, show some emotional respect, oh, respect, oh-ooh
