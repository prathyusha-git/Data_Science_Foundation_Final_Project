Well I'd walk on fire just to be next to you
And I'd climb the highest mountain
Just to see your point of view
And I'd swim the edge of the Earth
If you said you wanted proof
Yea, I'd do that for you
And if all of it is for naught
Well at least I took a shot
I hope my luck turns around sometime soon
And I'm so sorry for myself
Got me tied like a knot, twisted up in my thoughts
And I'm so sorry for myself
No I can't break it down
Not around this town no more

Well if you were lost I'd bring you safe back home
And wrestle with your demons
So you can be left alone
And I'd lay down my coat
So you can walk all over it
Just like you do me
I guess it's better lost than found
'Cause you just bring me down
I'm turning back before I get myself too deep
And I'm so sorry for myself
Got me tied like a knot, twisted up in my thoughts
And I'm so sorry for myself
No I can't break it down
Not around this town no more

Remember when we were young
Stayed up late to watch the sun
And you said you needed me to survive
We were young, and we were dumb
And now I see your heart is torn
The love you had for me is now gone
Like faith on fire
We both burned out long ago
The warmth we felt
To remind us how we used to feel alive
And I'm so sorry for myself
Got me tied like a knot, twisted up in my thoughts
And I'm so sorry for myself
No I can't break it down
Not around this town no more
