(Hicks)
She goes away for a couple of days
So you phone a few number you fancy a change
You say you'll miss her but deep down inside
There are thoughts of another girl waiting somewhere for you
She's been away for a couple of days
The affairs weren't so good so you're mending your ways
You realise that there's nobody else who can do what she does for you
You tell yourself don't be a fool
Don't let her go chase as hard as you can
Or you'll be the loser
Swallow your pride you can still be a man
She'll never refuse you
She deserved to be loved, she wants to love you
If you went away you know she'd be true, yes you do.
Baby I was lonely, still love you only, but I was a bad boy
Know you couldn't see me, thought you'd never leave me, so I was bad boy
Even though I'm trying, there is no denying I am just a bad boy
Met a little baby, thought she was a lady, still I was a bad boy
She gives me everything a girl's supposed to do
She gives me everything still I can't be true
She gives me everything, she gives me everything
Going off to different places
All I see is different faces
I love them all but not like you
She deserves to be loved, she wants to love you
If you went away you know she'd be true, yes you do.
She deserves to be loved - Yes she does, you know she does
She deserves to be loved - Even if she goes away
She deserves to be loved - No one else can take her place
She deserves to be loved - You'll be the loser if you let her go
She deserves to be loved - She gives you everything a girl's supposed to do
She deserves to be loved - You love them all but she's the one for you
She deserves to be loved - Yes she does, you know she does
She deserves to be loved - Even if she goes away
She deserves to be loved - No one else can take her place
