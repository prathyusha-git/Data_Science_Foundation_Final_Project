When I tell you something why don't you believe me?
If you always think I'm doing something greasy (Ohh ohh ohh ohhhh)
I can feel it in my heart I still love you (Ohh ohh)
But I don't know if I can take another sleepless night
No I don't know if I can take another stupid fight
No I don't know if I can take another sleepless night without you
You don't know I'm dying
Can't see my tear drops drying
We should be good by now
We should be good by now
And baby ain't you tired?
Every night and day, running around in circles baby nothing ever changed
We should be good by now
We should be good by now
Every time I walk away, I always run back (run back)
And nobody understands how much I miss that (Oh ohhh)
I can feel it in my heart I still love you
But I don't know if I can take another sleepless night
No I don't know if I can take another stupid fight
No I don't know if I can take another sleepless night without you
Tell me how much longer, want it to be over
I don't wanna argue, be angry no more
Don't know if I'm strong enough
This ain't the kind of love I every wanted
Never no never thought it would be like this
x2
But I don't know if I can take another sleepless night
No I don't know if I can take another stupid fight
We should be good by now
We should be good by now
