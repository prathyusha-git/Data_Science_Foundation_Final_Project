Get with this, get with this
Get with this 'cause you got no choice
Rappers sometimes you find make dough
But yo, you know they got no voice
Get him off the podium, he ain't no speaker
Yes, he's just a phony and look at his sneakers
Played out, out of style, out of rhymes
He's out his mind, lost his way, lost his pay
I'm takin' his props, so call the cops
You can call 'em, but I know 'em
Sweet MCs, I think I'll hoe 'em
'Cause they front so very hard
And big or small, I'll break 'em all
Ain't gotta say that I'm the best
My skills will show I passed the test
And when it comes to beats and rhymes
We come correctly every time
And stay tuned
Stay tuned
Stay tuned
Stay tuned
Information like the CNN
Yes, I can take you there and then
The rest is up to you to choose
The bottom line is win or lose
Suckers, suckers, suckers don't be listenin'
So I can't be waitin' on 'em
I ain't got no time to play, do you?
Look at the state of things and tell me true
In the city, any city
Life's a paradox of good and evil
Many fall into the vicious cycle
Livin' by the gun or by the rifle
They think they got a reason, they ain't really sure
The death toll rises more
It's trife the way some live life
I love rap, I like the city
But for a fool, I have no pity
There's too much sufferin', too much struggle
Too much injustice, and don't it bug you?
Enough for you to press on harder
Against the odds, the way our forefathers made a way
But foolishly, we go astray
Think about it and stay tuned
Stay tuned
Stay tuned
♪
What you really oughta do is lay back smooth
As my vocals complement the slow fat groove
Just for you to blast around the way
Play it nice and loud and hear me say
Gang Starr is hittin' '92 and on
Showin' how to make a dope rap song
Doin' this while some disperse
Then dissolve like specks of dirt
Our music pertains to those who remain
Down with the real, not one for the fame
Peace out, we'll be back, stay tuned
Please stay tuned
