Hey Willy, your mother calls you Billy
Your father calls you silly
But you really are a pretty one
Hey baby, you're dressing like a lady
The fellows call you Sadie
But you really are a pretty one
You don't care
What they say about your hair
'Cause the bad man's smiling
Every time he sees you comin', yeah
Willy is the singer in a rock 'n' roll band
Every time he shows his face
It's just to put away a grand, oh yeah
Willy's gonna show them now
No, no, no, no
Willy's gonna go somehow
My name's Willy, gonna turn on the lights
Playing rock 'n' roll music till' the early, early night
Can't stop jamming to the rhythms in your feet
Listen to the drummer, yeah, listen to the beat, oh yeah
Willy's gonna show them now
No, no, no, no
Willy's gonna go somehow
