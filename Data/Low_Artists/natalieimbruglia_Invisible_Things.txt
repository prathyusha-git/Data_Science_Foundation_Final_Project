I don't really care about diamonds
I don't really care about flowers
I just need a couple more hours with you
I don't want a big demonstration
I don't want confetti going wasted
I just wanna stay right here with you
You make me believe in invisible things
We found our love in the space in between
I can't see it but I need it
I can't touch it but I feel it
You make me believe in invisible things
I can feel magic when I'm with you
Cut through static when I kiss you
Well there's a little spark in everything you do
I don't need the sun to shine
If I've got you by my side
You make me believe in invisible things
We found our love in the space in between
I can't see it but I need it
I can't touch it but I feel it
You make me believe in invisible things
Ohh-ohh
Ohh-ohh
Ohh-ohh
Ohh-ohh
You make me believe in invisible things
We found our love in the space in between
I can't see it but I need it
I can't touch it but I feel it
You make me believe in invisible things
Ohh-ohh
Ohh-ohh
Ohh-ohh
Ohh-ohh
Ohh-ohh
Ohh-ohh
Ohh-ohh
Ohh-ohh
