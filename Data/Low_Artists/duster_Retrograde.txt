The darkness comes, it feels so near
The stars come out tonight
They tell you things you like to hear
So quiet and so kind
Now don't be sad, you're not alone
Your friends are standing by
They're waiting for you back at home
And all will be alright
They wait so long
They wait so long for you
♪
The branches reaching out to you
Will try to touch your face
Your step is lighted by the moon
The shadows change their shape
The animals all hide from view
The secret lies in wait
Does your elusive dream come true
Or does it slip away?
To be someone
To be someone like you
♪
You trace along delicate lines
Design disintegrates
It's not too late to change your mind
And play in retrograde
To be someone
To be someone like you
