If travel is searching
And home what's been found
I'm not stopping

I'm going hunting
I'm the hunter
I'll bring back the goods
But I don't know when

How scandinavian of me
En-cha-le-li, en-cha-
You sussed it out, didn't you?
You could smell it
So you left me on my own
To complete the mission
Now I'm leaving it all behind
I'm going hunting
I'm the hunter
I'm the hunter
I'm going hunting
I'm the hunter
I'm the hunter
I'm the hunter
I'm the hunter
