Saturday night, I was downtown
Workin' for the FBI
Sittin' in a nest of bad men
Whiskey bottles pilin' high
Bootleggin' boozer on the west side
Full of people who are doin' wrong
Just about to call up the D.A. man
When I heard this woman singin' a song
A pair of .45's made me open my eyes
My temperature started to rise
She was a long cool woman in a black dress
What a 5'9, beautiful tall
With just one look, I was a bad mess
'Cause that long cool woman had it all
♪
Whoa!
I saw her headin' to the table
Well, a tall walkin' big black cat
A-Charlie said, "I hope that you're able, boy
'Cause I'm tellin' ya she knows where it's at"
Well, suddenly we heard the sirens
And everybody started to run
A-Jumpin' under doors and tables
Well, I heard somebody shootin' a gun
Well, the D.A. was pumpin' my left hand
I mean, she was whole on my right
Well, I told her, "Don't get scared
'Cause you're gonna be spared"
I've gotta be forgiven if I wanna spend my livin'
With a long cool woman in a black dress
Just a 5'9, beautiful tall
Well, with just one look, I was a bad mess
'Cause that long cool woman had it all
Had it all
Had it all
Had it all
Had it all
Had it all
Ooh
Had it all
Ah, she had it all
Yeah
