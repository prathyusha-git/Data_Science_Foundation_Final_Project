They say that you should leave them wanting
Before somebody's wanting you to leave
I said an hour ago, I was gonna hit the road
Don't know what has gotten into me
A simple get-together, turning into so much better
A moment, becomes a memory
Oh, it's a good goodbye
Hope you had a real good time
Cause I know I'm smiling while I walk away
Hey, feeling alright
Wrapping up a real good night
Cause I know I'm smiling while I walk away
Still laughing now as I remember
Crying at the crazy things we said
(Crying at the crazy things we said)
And I can't make it home
Cause we're still texting on the phone
Dropping bombs and blowing up this thread
I've got a favorite new song
It's that one we played all night long
And now it's spinning in my head
Oh, it's a good goodbye
Hope you had a real good time
Cause I know I'm smiling while I walk away
Hey, feeling alright
Wrapping up a real good night
Cause I know I'm smiling while I walk away
See you again
I'd wanna see you again real soon
See you again
I wanna, make it soon
See you again
See you again
See you again
Make it soon
Oh, it's a good goodbye
Hope you had a real good time
Cause I know I'm smiling while I walk away
Hey, feeling alright
Wrapping up a real good night
Cause I know I'm smiling while I walk away
Goodbye
Goodbye
A good goodbye
Had a good time
I'm smiling while I walk away
Goodbye
Goodbye
A good goodbye
Had a good time
I'm smiling while I walk away
Goodbye
Goodbye
A good goodbye
Had a good time
I'm smiling while I walk away
(Repeat Fade out)
