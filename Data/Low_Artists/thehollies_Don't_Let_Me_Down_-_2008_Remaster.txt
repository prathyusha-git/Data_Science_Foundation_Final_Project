The sun is overshadowed by the presence of the moon
Nighttime has fallen
She'll be comin' home soon
Leave the door wide open, ah, so she won't need a key
Lock it behind you, baby
Draw the blinds, so no one can see
There's only one thing on my mind
Don't let, don't let me down
Don't let, don't let me down
Feelings are near the ground
Silence is golden, ah, but for me there's just one choice
Music of your laughter
Rippling of your voice
The freshness of the evergreen, ah, fades as if too shy
Can't compete with your beauty
Couldn't if it tried
There's only one thing on my mind
Don't let, don't let me down
Don't let, don't let me down
Feelings are near the ground
Let's build something to climb on
Making the show a live one
No need for makeup, let's be real
Give all in what you're giving
Making life worth living
Being alive's how you should feel
Oh, and don't let, don't let me down
My feelings are near the ground
Don't want the sun to be shining
Raising his eyebrows at the moon
Saying I told you so, she wouldn't show
Well, don't speak too soon
I hear her footsteps walking on the outer floor
Well, it could be, I don't know
I don't know for sure
There's only one thing on my mind
Don't let, don't let me down
Don't let, don't let me down
Feelings are near the ground
(Come on back, can't live without you)
(Come on back) I need you, I need you, I (can't live without you)
(Come on back) I want you, I want you, I (can't live without you)
(Come on back) c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, I (can't live without you)
(Come on back) I love you, I love you, I (can't live without you)
(Come on back) I need you, I need you, I (can't live without you)
