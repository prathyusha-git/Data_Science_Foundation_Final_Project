If you could hold on to this
Thought we lost it long ago
In dream we'll return to this
In familiar fields before
And I thought we had forever and we would have it all
Secret on the breath like a path to lead you home
I hear your voice like you are still here
Part of a dream I can't remember

Just out of reach

Wait for me there, coming to find you
Stars in the sea fade into nothing
Fall in too deep
