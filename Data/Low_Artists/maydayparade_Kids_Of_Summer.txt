There's a time that's always so fitting
Where the sites and sounds were just the beginning
I didn't know that years ago I'd find myself
In ways that warped my brain
And I knew that everything would be better
If we only had more time
But in the moment I found simpler things
Yeah, in the moment I found mine
But it's a long way down after the other
12 long months until I recover
It's a long way down after the other one
Those days are long gone but we can all pretend
Our love was so strong
Let's do it all again and make new scars
We'll fly into the night like shooting stars
Faster, go faster so we can finally breathe
Turn up the stereo and let us all sing
Our favorite songs, the ones that keep reminding us
That we were the kids of the summer
Those days, I remember 'em hitting like a tidal wave
Wrapped up in a pretty little face
Covered me entirely with sun and rain through summer days
And oh, my heart grew bigger back then somehow
I got the feeling I wanted but it's all gone now
Thought it would last forever inside my chest
Let's keep it beating together
But it's a long way down after the other
12 long months until I recover
It's a long way down after the other one
Those days are long gone but we can all pretend
Our love was so strong
Let's do it all again and make new scars
We'll fly into the night like shooting stars
Faster, go faster so we can finally breathe
Turn up the stereo and let us all sing
Our favorite songs, the ones that keep reminding us
That we were the kids of the summer
The summer
The summer
It was all ours
And I knew that everything would be better
If we only had more time
But in the moment I found simpler things
Yeah, in the moment I found mine
But it's a long way down after the other
12 long months until I recover
It's a long way down after the other one
Those days are long gone but we can all pretend
Our love was so strong
Let's do it all again and make new scars
We'll fly into the night like shooting stars
Faster, go faster so we can finally breathe
Turn up the stereo and let us all sing
Our favorite songs, the ones that keep reminding us
That we were the kids of the summer
The summer
The summer
It was all ours
We were the kids of the summer
