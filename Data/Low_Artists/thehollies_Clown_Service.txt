Is that the clown service I'm calling?
I made a fool of myself again
There's a hole in my pocket, a patch on my pants
My shoes let in water, I need it in your hands
Look up the smile service, operator
I got some frown lines that need to be erased
I look in the mirror, I sigh all the time
The face that I see, I know it ain't mine
Ooh-wee, lady, if I had my baby
I wouldn't be wasting your time
Ooh-wee, lady, if I had my baby
I wouldn't be blocking, blocking your line
Is that the love service I'm calling?
Come on over, mend my broken heart
Was it so silly? Was Cupid so stupid?
Or maybe it wasn't to be that way at all
Ooh-wee, lady, if I had my baby
I wouldn't be wasting your time
Ooh-wee, lady, if I had my baby
I wouldn't be blocking, blocking your line
Is that the clown service I'm calling?
