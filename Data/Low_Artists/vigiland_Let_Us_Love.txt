Hey, you there
I can see that you are so unaware
But your eyes, they know
It's better if you gave him all the control
'Cause we got something special, you and I
And all the people in here's trying to find it
Yeah, you deserve attention and I won't mind
If we gave, if we gave it a try
Even if we're not in love tomorrow
Maybe we're not meant to be for life
Even if it's not the same tomorrow
Let us love, let us love here tonight
Even if we're not in love tomorrow
Maybe we're not meant to be for life
Even if it's not the same tomorrow
Let us love, let us love here tonight
'Cause I got a feeling (feeling)
You want it babe (want it babe)
Let us, let us love tonight
'Cause I got a feeling (feeling)
You want it babe
Let us love, let us love here tonight
Free your mind
Let the rhythm take over for a while
It's what you need
So why don't you move your body closer to me?
'Cause we got something special, you and I
And all the people in here's trying to find it
Yeah, you deserve attention and I won't mind
If we gave, if we gave it a try
Even if we're not in love tomorrow
Maybe we're not meant to be for life
Even if it's not the same tomorrow
Let us love, let us love here tonight
Even if we're not in love tomorrow
Maybe we're not meant to be for life
Even if it's not the same tomorrow
Let us love, let us love here tonight
'Cause I got a feeling (feeling)
You want it babe (want it babe)
Let us, let us love tonight
'Cause I got a feeling (feeling)
You want it babe
Let us love, let us love here tonight
Even if we're not in love tomorrow
Maybe we're not meant to be for life
Even if it's not the same tomorrow
Let us love, let us love here tonight
