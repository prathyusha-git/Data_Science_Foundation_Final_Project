Don't need no one fucking up my shit
Okay, bitch
Get the fuck off me

Fuck your rules
Who are you to tell me
What I can and can't do, fuck you, bitch
You just want to be me
I party properly
Nobody fuck with me
Wear what the fuck I like in the streets
Rock pajamas like a G
You're not the boss of me
Rock 'em, I got no apology
Neill says that I'm an anomoly
I get money for free

People get lost in and start basking in my mystic company

If a bitch tryna fuck with me
That bitch better be fit

Our zef rights get sued, some poofies in the hood
La-di-da-di, yo, we party 'til the cops go 'whoo'
People think I'm interesting, 'cause I have fun and do my own thing
I don't smile, I snarl for the camera, golden tooth go shing
Some people think I'm insane or they think I'm pain
This is my resting bitch face, nothing wrong, ok?
