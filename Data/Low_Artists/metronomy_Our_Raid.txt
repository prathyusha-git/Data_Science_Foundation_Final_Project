We took the motor from the dash till
We'll take it back 'cause we're not thieves
And now we're heading back to your house
It's so exciting and it feels right
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
(oooh, oooh)
Put back the garlic
Rip our souls out
Or else it's gonna rip
A tooth
You're real hard to watch
Right now
Go down, down
Down, down, down
Like Oh
