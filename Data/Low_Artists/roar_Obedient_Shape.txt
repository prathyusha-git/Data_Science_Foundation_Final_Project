Then you can't complain
When it feels like you're frozen in place
Feels like you're frozen in place
Taking each day like a torrent of waves
Carving expressions in your stony face
Crushed by sea like it's a routine
(It's a routine, it's a routine)
In that wake is an obedient shape
If you want change, you'll have to learn how to not drown
Till then it seems to have to work itself out

To bless distress, I wither away
I try to remember, but I know I can't keep track of the things you say
