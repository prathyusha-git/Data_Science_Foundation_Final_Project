What's this game that we pretend to play?
Always a day too late to try and pick up that weight
If you want me to try I will try 'til you're satisfied
Promise if things go right, we can go back if you'd like
Stuck in between
Caught in the meantime
Always alone, even the one time this feeling's let me in
So it has to be just like you had imagined it'd be
With a rope in your one hand, rock in the other, swim for the shore
I don't belong here, and you don't belong here
Let's swim for the shore, mm-mm
Stuck in between
Caught in the meantime
Always alone, even the one time this feeling's let me in
When you were outside, I was screamin' your name through the radio
And wouldn't I lie just to sing of your praise with hymns (whoa)
When you were gone, I forgot how to make anything at all
You left before it was time to go
Mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm
