Think it over what you just said
Think it over in your pretty little head
Are you sure that I'm not the one?
Is your love real or only fun?
Think it over, just think it over
My lonely heart grows cold and old
Think it over and let me know
Think it over and don't be slow
Just remember all birds and bees
Go back to school, life's mysteries
Think it over, just think it over
My lonely heart grows cold and old
Think it over, over and over
Think it over, over and over
Think it over, over and over
Think it over, over and over
Think it over, just think it over
My lonely heart grows cold and old, alright, alright
Think it over and think of me
Think it over and you will see
The happy day when you and I
Think as one and kiss the blues goodbye
Think it over, just think it over
My lonely heart grows cold and old
Think it over, over and over
Think it over, over and over
Think it over, over and over
Think it over, over and over
Think it over, just think it over
My lonely heart grows cold and old
Think it over, over and over
Think it over, over and over
Think it over, over and over
Think it over, over and over
Think it over, just think it over
My lonely heart grows cold and old
