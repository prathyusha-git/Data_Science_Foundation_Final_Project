There's a road I know I must go
Even though I tell myself
That road is closed
Listen, lonely seabird
You've been away from land too long
Aw, too long
I don't listen to the news no more
Like an unwound clock
You just don't seem to care
This world isn't big enough
To keep me away from you
Oh, from you
Seabird, seabird
Fly home
Seabird, seabird
Fly home
Like a lonely seabird
You've been away from land too long
Oh, too long
Suddenly, you're with me
I turn, and you're not there
Like a ghost, you haunt me
You find warmth in a one-night bed
♪
Sunsets, full moons
Don't turn you on
Like an untied dog
You just had to run
Like a lonely seabird
You've been away from land too long
Oh, no, too long (so long, seabird)
Seabird, seabird
Fly home (like a lonely bird)
Seabird, seabird
Fly home
Seabird, seabird
Fly home (seabird, sea)
Seabird, seabird
Fly home
