Yeah
I've been wearin' this same outfit for the last three days
Like, "Bitch, do I look I care?"
Nah, I never signed a deal, always independent
Like, "Bitch, do I look like I share?"
Nah, always playing games, always playing wit' me
Like, "Bitch, do I look like a fair?"
Nah, always steppin' on me, it's sleepin' on me
Like, "Bitch, do I look like a chair?"
Not prepared to feast, it's time to eat
How can I copy you when you're a lesser me?
You made a lot of noise, I made a masterpiece
Still laughin' at a few who laughed at me (Hehehe)
All the way to your desk
All I see is my worst when you offer your best
And you know I don't normally flex
But we came up from nothing, TEAMWITT 'til our deathbed, yes
Here is a fact
Could hold my whole nation with knives in my back
Some people still owe me a sorry in fact
Can keep all that shit, I don't live in the past
I'm livin' to rap, I'm rappin' to live
I can't tell the difference, you get what you give
You only hurt you if you never forgive
You already lost if you never begin
It's what it is, talk all your shit
Confused if you think I'm not one to go savage
You live in a basement and post your reactions
Of people who made it 'cause you were to average
If something's you teach how our rappin' is here
Please give your opinion, I'm dyin' to hear it
See, all of the things that you did in the year
That still never led to a music career
Oh, yikes, here, let me help
"Witt Lowry sucks, he should be shelfed"
Lately he's soundin' like everyone else
You copied the shit 'cause that shit wouldn't sell
If you'd change a word, or a lyric or two
And put it back out and pretend that it's new
Then maybe you'll grow in the way that he grew
I'm glad I aspired, but credit me too
Day in my shoes, you wouldn't last
Listen to "Hurt," listen to "Crash"
Try to do good, try to give back
And spill out my soul over all of my tracks
Craps in the barrel, they look down and laugh
And wring us for every last dollar we have
It's easy to make your lil' rappers look bad
When you don't own half of good tracks that you rap, damn
(Hehehe, huh)
Get it all by ourselves, fuck your advance
Fuck all the dollars they gave you for marketing
I just want music to come from the heart again
I just want music to become an art again
I was still workin' while you were out partyin'
Wonderin' how did I build up an audience
I put in work and just thought it was obvious
Give me a mic and a beat and I'll body it
(Du-du-du-du) I've been nice, but don't push me
I rap from the heart and you call me a pussy
I think you're a coward, you talk like you would be
I'm mad 'cause is my life is where you think you should be
Like, what do you get from it? Posting online
And just spreadin' some negative shit all the time
Yeah, your comment was mean, but I think I'll be fine
Hate the life that you live, so you're hatin' on mine (gah)
♪
If you want to keep your integrity
You can't go on for mass production, can you?
I mean you can't just become a little cog in the big machine
Can you?
I should probably call my mom, it's been a couple weeks
Funny how I live the dream but I don't fuckin' sleep
They bring nothing to the table and they want a seat
Constant battle in my mind and all I want is peace
I keep my trophies on the low so they don't feel bad
"Last Letter" at my show, I know they feel that
I show the people perseverance when I feel sad
I put the music out for free and yet I feel trapped
I used to never own a thing and now I own shit
Livin' in and out of bag like I'm homeless
That's when I realize that it's people that are home, shit
As I look at all my things, I'm feeling homesick (Feeling homesick)
