Yeah, uh
Yeah, uh
It's about time
I-, I-, I-, I-, I-
It's about time
Justine, uh
There's a lot I could say
You deserve the payback
Bad, but I can't runnin' back
So fast, at last
On the strip
There's a lot I won't say
Don't wanna just react
Facts, this time I won't relapse
Knew that none of y'all had my back
I found a way out, and on your way out
Last words
I'm on the way up, and I'ma be straight, so
Don't worry 'bout it
You hide your face, can't stop talking 'bout it
Don't worry 'bout a thing
'Cause it won't matter anyway
Bury my best
It's a new day
'Cause I know I can always count on you
To make me look stupid, make me look foolish
And I know I can always count on you
To let me down
Down, down, down
'Kay, uh
'Kay, uh
Okay, so now that we're through
I saw what's real, and knew was true
You followed me, I followed you
It's almost hot, 'cause you was new, but
They'll all regret that
'Cause I'll be right back
Flyback, it's gon' be private
Funny to see
How they all undergraded me, ah
I found a way out, and on your way out
Last words
I'm on the way up, and I'ma be straight, so
Don't worry 'bout it
You hide your face, can't stop talking 'bout it
Don't worry 'bout a thing
'Cause it won't matter anyway
Bury my best
It's a new day
'Cause I know I can always count on you
To make me look stupid, make me look foolish
And I know I can always count on you
To let me down
Down, down, yeah
