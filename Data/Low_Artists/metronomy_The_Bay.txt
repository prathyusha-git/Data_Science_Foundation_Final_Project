You may have the money
But you've got to go
It's sensible, it's sensible
And those endless seasons
That go on and on
Incredible
But I'd sooner get out
Remember where we went last year?
You said everything about it moved on your career
If you want to go
I'll take you back one day
'Cause this isn't Paris and this isn't London
And it's not Berlin and it's not Hong Kong
Not Tokyo
If you want to go
I'll take you back one day
It feels so good
In the bay
♪
It feels so good
In the bay
♪
You may have the body
But do you have the soul?
Let's make this happen, let's make this happen
And those endless beaches
That go on and on
It's magical
But I'd sooner get out
Remember where we went last year?
You said everything about it moved on your career
And you said, "(If you) If you (Want to go) want to go
(I'll take you back one day)"
'Cause this isn't Paris and this isn't London
And it's not Berlin and it's not Hong Kong
Not Tokyo
If you want to go
I'll take you back one day
It feels so good
