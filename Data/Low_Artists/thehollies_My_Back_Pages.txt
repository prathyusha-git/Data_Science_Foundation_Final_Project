Crimson flames tied through my ears rollin' high and mighty traps
Pounced with fire on flamin' roads usin' ideas my maps
"We'll meet on edges soon" said I proud 'neath heated brow
Ah, but I was so much older than, I'm younger than that now
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth "Rip down all hate" I screamed
Lies that life is black and white spoke from my skull I dreamed
Romantic facts of musketeers foundationed deep somehow
Ah, but I was so much older than, I'm younger than that now
Girls' faces formed the forward path from phony jealousy
To memorizin' politics of ancient history
Flung down by corpse evangelists unthought of, though, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older than, I'm younger than that now
♪
Ah, but I was so much older than, I'm younger than that now
My guard stood hard when abstract threats too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinkin' I had somethin' to protect
Good and bad, I define these terms quite clear, no doubt, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older than, I'm younger than that now
I'm younger than that now
I'm younger than that now
I'm younger than that now
I'm younger than that now
