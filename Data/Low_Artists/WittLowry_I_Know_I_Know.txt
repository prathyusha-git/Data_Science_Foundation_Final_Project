Look, I ain't gonna lie
I was trying to find feelings
'Cause lately I've been feeling numb
It's not fair to you
You deserve the one
Stop telling me I'm the perfect one
'Cause perfect is perception
Perception is all that they could see
Saw people turn fake like make believe
Never gonna find fake in me
No, don't ever give a fuck if they hate you
They'd probably hate themselves too
A couple girls wanna date you
A couple years ago, I was see through
You would never make it from the same shoes
Never gave me credit when I paid dues
Need a couple beats to put the pain to
A couple years ago, that was me too
That was back when I could barely pay rent
Saving water bottles just to make cents
Spilled my soul each and every night
On a couple beats with Dan Haynes and
Was waiting tables and a waitress told
me that my stupid dreams never made sense
Had a 9 to 5,
couple of people hating and they still sitting at the same desk
I know, I know
I got this shit,
Don't fuck with lames who wanna be me
Put my all into this shit
I'm a problem is how they see me
Thought they had it in the bag
But now it's me, myself, and I
No I know, I got the juice
I keep it true forever, I,
I know, I know
I came from nothing
But I'm feeling like the man right now
I know, I know now
I know, I know now
They don't like me,
I don't fit into their plans right now
I know, I know now
I know, I know now
I stand for something and that's why it's where I'm standing right now
I know, I know now
I know, I know now
Thought I would quit,
But shit, this world is in my hands right now
Yeah, I know, I know
I know, I know I deserve better
We were held together by 4 letters
Took a a couple L's
Ended up in hell
Thought the love was real
Should've known better
Had to bounce back
Invest all the money my account had
While rappers rap about a round ass
I'ma fuck the game and take the crown back
This is a sound fact
Here's a soundtrack for everyone who doubted,
And even me, I even thought about it
Your fake love, I could do without it
Every fucking stage, I hear the people shouting
I'm the people's champ
I'm the new rock
This is new rap, this is new pop
This is new rock
I fit no genre
The one and only,
The new mantra
Fuck commas,
Don't ever stop it
Still underrated,
Started from the bottom
Only see me fall,
If it was fucking autumn
Got a lot of followers
Who would pad your bottom
I'm a fucking problem
Should say it twice,
I'm a fucking problem
Through the pain I write
Talk to myself when I need great advice
Stars shine the brightest in the darkest nights
I know, I know
I got this shit,
Don't fuck with lames who wanna be me
Put my all into this shit
I'm a problem is how they see me
Thought they had it in the bag
But now it's me, myself, and I
No, I know I got the juice
I keep it true forever, I,
I know, I know
I came from nothing,
But I'm feeling like the man right now
I know, I know now
I know, I know now
They don't like me,
I don't fit into their plans right now
I know, I know now
I know, I know now
I stand for something and that's why it's where I'm standing right now
I know, I know now
I know, I know now
Thought I would quit,
But shit, this world is in my hands right now
Yeah, I know, I know
You didn't fuck with me then,
How are you gonna fuck with me now
Funny how everything changed
Now they in love with the sound
Don't give a fuck what they say
You should come see me on tour
Had a catastrophe
You cannot play me no more
Maybe I should get high
Yeah, something to balance the lows
Something to deal with the pain
Someone to call on my phone
I'm in love with the truth
Did this all on my own
Only real will remain
Maybe that's all I know
I know, I know
I got this shit
Don't fuck with lames who wanna be me
Put my all into this shit
I'm a problem is how they see me
Thought they had it in the bag
But now it's me, myself, and I
No, I know I got the juice,
I keep it true forever, I,
I know, I know
I came from nothing
But I'm feeling like the man right now
I know, I know now
I know, I know now
They don't like me,
I don't fit into their plans right now
I know, I know now
I know, I know now
I stand for something and that's why it's where I'm standing right now
I know, I know now
I know, I know now
Thought I would quit,
But shit, this world is in my hands right now
Yeah, I know, I know
