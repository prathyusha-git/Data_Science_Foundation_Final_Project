Now it's hard to see with all these
Flashing cameras in my face
But I love the way they play
Throwing shadows on the stage
Wonder where you are and
What you think about this place
I can't help but miss the days
And I'll write on every page
My hero, she's the last real dreamer I know
And I can tell you all about her
I don't think I'll fall asleep 'til
I roll over
Can we just start it over again?
And I can tell you all about
I don't think I'll fall asleep 'til then
♪
And now I just had this dream
That we were on my bed again
Makin' love the way we did
Tell me, how could I forget?
This can't be healthy now
The way I dream about your lips
But this just wasn't any kiss
I hope you're still not over this
Not at least 'til I get over you
My hero, she's the last real dreamer I know
And I can tell you all about her
I don't think I'll fall asleep
'Til I roll over
Can we just start it over again?
And I can tell you all about
I don't think I'll fall asleep 'til then
♪
And now I get left alone
While you are lost in outer space
Spreading love another way
And we'll meet again someday
I've taken all I can
And I keep thinkin' just the same
I guess I'll die another day
But I'm sure, I'll be on my way
Maybe I'll collapse and float away
Please, go home
My hero, she's the last real dreamer I know
And I can tell you all about her
I don't think I'll fall asleep
'Til I roll over
Can we just start it over again?
And I can tell you all about
I don't think I'll fall asleep 'til then
