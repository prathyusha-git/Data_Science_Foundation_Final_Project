In the nursery
Where ocean meets the shore
In the place where we could meet
You will be all alone
So as we angle to the new
Tow on a thawing frontier
Never a woman on the shore
A witness or a love
I looked out for you
But looking never meant less
I could feel that you were gone
And I despondent turned and left
I reached out for you
But reaching never meant less
I could feel that you were gone
And I despondent turned and left
We looked out across the long horizon
We looked in each other's eyes
And realized that we are only one
Through a moment we could glimpse an infinity
And through an infinity we could see
All in all is all we are
