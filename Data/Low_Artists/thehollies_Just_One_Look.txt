And I felt so I, I, I'm in love
With you

How good it feels, feels, feels
To have your love

Forever and always

Just one look
And I knew, knew, knew
That you were my only one

But I was wrong, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, but I'm gonna keep on scheming
'Til I can make you
Make you my own
So you see
I really care
Without you, I'm nothin'
Oh, oh
Just one look
And I know
I'll get you someday
Oh-oh-whoa
I thought I was dreaming
But I was wrong, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, but I'm gonna keep on scheming
'Til I can make you
Make you my own
Just one look
That's all it took, yeah
Just one look
That's all it took, yeah
Just one look
That's all it took, yeah
Just one look
That's all it took, yeah
