Musical pictures
Colouring in the sound
Touching the feelings
Writing my thoughts down
Something that I can share with you
I can get carried away
Carried away
Carried away by the melody
'Cause I can't say what I really feel with words
I'm trying so hard to reach you
I hope that I'm getting through
Musical pictures
Scenes of a song
You're instrumental
You're where it comes from
It's easy to play along
And get carried away
Carried away
Carried away by the melody
'Cause I can't say what I really feel with words
I'm trying so hard to reach you
I hope that I'm getting through
Silence is my canvas
I can paint a sad song blue
And make musical pictures
Any way I want to
I'm trying so hard to reach you
I hope that I'm getting through
Oh-oh-oh
Carried away
Carried away
Carried away by the melody
'Cause I can't say what I really feel with words
I'm trying so hard to reach you
I hope that I'm getting through
I can get carried away
Carried away
Carried away by the melody
'Cause I can't say what I really feel with words
I'm trying so hard to reach you
I hope that I'm getting through
