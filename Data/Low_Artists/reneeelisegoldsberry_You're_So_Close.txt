You think you have misplaced your calling
Feels like life wasn't meant to go your way
When you wanna run but you're stuck crawling
Close your eyes and try to hide your face
But the spark never leaves
Waiting to make an explosion
You just roll up your sleeves
And you keep on going
You keep on going
Right where you are standing
Is right on top of the gold
Sometimes good ain't handed to ya
But it's under your nose
Don't give up, you're so close
♪
Seems like everyone else is dreaming
They walk in shoes that were meant to get them there
You're stuck on the ground, arms up pleading
For the wings that'll fly you through the air
No choice but to fight
Until the curtain closing
Every day and every night
Yeah, you keep on going
You keep on going
Right where you are standing
Is right on top of the gold
Sometimes good ain't handed to you
But it's under your nose
Reach for it, you're so close
♪
It's hard believing when your world is dark
But blind reaching shows you who you are
So close your eyes and you'll find your way
Yeah close your eyes and you'll find it
Right where you are standing
Is right on top of the gold
Sometimes good, ain't handed to you
But it's under your nose
Reach for it, you're so close
It's hard believing, so close
It's hard believing, so close
