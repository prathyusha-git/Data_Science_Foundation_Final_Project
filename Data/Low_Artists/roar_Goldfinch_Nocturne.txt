With golden lungs and ivory teeth
♪
Still hard to breathe
And to speak...
Still hard to breathe
And to speak...
Try to take what they were offering
Try to find the good in anything
It's wasted like a breeze on broken wings
♪
When your eyes are flowering and you can find what's left of me
I'll be waiting patiently
For loneliness to set me free...
