I have seen enough
I have seen enough
I have seen enough
But I just can't look away
We can watch the flowerbeds rising
Each year, our children grow
I will sit with you in silence
As we watch our favourite show
But I have seen enough
I have seen enough
I have seen enough
But I just can't look away

I have seen enough
I have seen enough
I have seen enough
But I just can't look away
We could pick the fruit in autumn
We can turn the ground in spring
And I'll watch another sunset, by your side
And together we will sing
I have seen enough
I have seen enough
I have seen enough
But I just can't look away
