Up on the toe
There is a view
Up on the toe
And the spine
Straight and erect
Hungry and curious
Up on the toe
Looking forward to

The air is thinner here
♪
She came here
To lose face
Got down on her knees
The beast is back!
On four legs
Set her clock to the Moon
Raises her spine
♪
Vertebrae by vertebrae
Up on the toe
Looking
♪
I have been filled with steam for months, for years
Same old cloud, claustrophobic me
Let it burst like old train sounds
Make them leave me nature
♪
Vertebrae by vertebrae
By vertebrae
By vertebrae
By vertebrae
My arms ooze out of my shoulders!
And the arms ooze out of my shoulders
I curl my tail inwards, inwards
♪
I set my clock on the Moon
Vertebrae by vertebrae

Please release this pressure of me
Please release this pressure of me
Please release this pressure of me
Let off some steam.
