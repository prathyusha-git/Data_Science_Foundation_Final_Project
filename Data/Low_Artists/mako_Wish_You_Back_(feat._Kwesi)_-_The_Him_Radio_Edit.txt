I get so deep in the bottle
That I can't swim back out
I swear I'm meant to call you
If I could get back out
At five o'clock my shadow empty as a grave
I hope you can forgive
That I let slip nine-hundred chances to say
I love you
'Cause I take one step forward
Take two steps back
I keep reaching out for you
But you already left
And I don't know when we fell off track
But if I had one wish
I'd wish you back
I'd wish you back
♪
Do you remember?
'Cause I just can't forget
If I could see you smile like that again
It'd mean everything
And I know that I lost you out in the rain
I hope you can forgive
That I let slip nine-hundred chances to say
I love you
'Cause I take one step forward
Take two steps back
I keep reaching out for you
But you already left
And I don't know when we fell off track
If I had one wish
I'd wish you back
I'd wish you back
♪
I'd wish you back
I'd wish you, I'd wish you, I'd wish you
I'd wish you back
