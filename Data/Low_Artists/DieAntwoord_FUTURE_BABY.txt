I'm on that next murdered out flow Level X full muddafuckin' flex
Big fat cribs, sick black whips, yes, da gods are blessed
Big bedroom in the back of the tour bus smells like sex
Zef af rock big gold chains round our necks
Golden grin golden wrists golden fist grip a golden mic
Spit giftige shit like a muddafukin' cobra strike

You can feel it in your girlfriends panties every time I spit
I was born to piss muddafukkas off, I don't care, I love it
Baby girl know what time it is, yo, it's time to fuck
On the back of my bulletproof Tesla Cybertruck
Future baby, more human than human
