(Hicks / Clarke / Nash)
I've just come in from out of the rain
It's wet outside the water runs down a drain
I go to bed 'cause my head's full of pain
And drip drip it's driving me wild
Drip drip it's driving me wild
Outside the window there's a pipe wearing thin
It lets the water do a dance on a tin
I try to sleep but it's making a din
And drip drip it's driving me wild
Drip drip it's driving me wild
Water on the brain water on the brain
Water on the brain water on the brain
Drip drip it's driving me wild
Drip drip it's driving me wild
I toss and turn and my patience is weak
Go to the bathroom door and I take a peak yeah
The bath tap has started a leak
And drip drip it's driving me wild
Drip drip it's driving me wild
Drip drip it's driving me wild
Drip drip it's driving me wild
