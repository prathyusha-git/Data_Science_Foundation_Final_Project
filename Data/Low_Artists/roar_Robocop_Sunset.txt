Awake and
Dying
I felt my flesh as it became money
If I could
I'd scream
To the cadence of a surgical team
My brand new memory
Bloomed a paralyzing circuitry
I'm useful and free
Born again inside a new home screen
♪
Relieved of
Thinking
I did impressions of a perfect machine
You'd sown your pixel face like seed, and
In my moments of weakness, I'd reap
In my moments of weakness, I'd reap
In my moments of weakness, I'd reap
Cocaine-capped, steel and glass mountains
Block my sunsets
The blood ballet's not done yet
The blood ballet's not done yet
The mountains block my sunsets
Am I a shining instrument
Of man's darkest resentments
Take my thoughts
I do not
Need them
Take my thoughts
I do not
Need them
Take my thoughts (Or in my moments)
I do not (of weakness)
Need them (I'd reap)
Take my thoughts (Or in my moments)
I do not (of weakness)
Need them (I'd reap)
Take my thoughts (Or in my moments)
I do not (of weakness)
Need them (I'd reap)
Take my thoughts (Or in my moments)
I do not (of weakness)
Need them (I'd reap)
