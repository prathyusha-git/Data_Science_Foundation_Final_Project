You stayed with me like glass between my teeth
We'll burn the house before anyone gets out
When life loses meaning, there doesn't need to be a reason
There doesn't need to be a reason
There doesn't need to be a reason
I may not move today
And if I don't, well, that's okay
Just like a tiger in a gas station cage
When you're stuck in this position
It's like training for the wrong conditions
You've been training for the wrong conditions
