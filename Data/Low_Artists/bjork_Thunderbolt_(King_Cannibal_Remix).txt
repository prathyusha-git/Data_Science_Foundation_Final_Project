stirring at water's edge
cold froth on my twig
my mind in whirls
wanders around desire
may i, can i or have i too often
craving miracles
may i, can i or have i too often now
craving miracles
craving miracles
no one imagines the light shock i need
and i'll never know
from who's hands deeply humble
dangerous gifts as such to mine come
may i, should i or have i too often
craving miracles
may i, can i or have i too often
craving miracles
craving miracles
my romantic gene is dominant
and it hungers for union
universal intimacy
all embracing
may i, should i or have i too often
craved miracles
may i, can i or have i too often
craved miracles
crave
waves irregularly striking
wind stern in my face
thunderstorm come
scrape those barnacles of me!
may i, may i or should i too often
crave miracles
may i or should i or have i too often
all my body parts are one
as lightning hits my spine
sparkling
prime runs through me
revive my wish
inviolable
may i, can i or have i too often
craving miracles
may i, can i, should i or have i too often
craving miracles
