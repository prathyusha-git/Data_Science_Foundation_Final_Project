My tear duct clogged
My left eye broken
Medicate with warm compress
Extract hardened tears
Sue me, sue me, sue me all you want
I won't denounce her origin
Sue me, sue me, sue me, all you want
I won't denounce our origin
I've ducked and dived
Like the mother in Solomon's Tale
To spare our girl
I won't let her get cut in half ever
But it's time to teach her some dignity
Sue me, sue me, sue me all you want
I won't denounce our origin
Sue me, sue me, sue me, sue me
I won't, I won't denounce our origin (no, I won't)
Who took it from his father
Who took it from his father
Who took it from his father
Let's break this curse
So it won't fall on our daughter
And her daughter
And her daughter
Won't let this sink into her DNA
Sue me, sue me, sue me, sue me all you want
I won't let you denounce our origin
Sue me, sue me, sue me
Denounce our origin
No, I won't
Can't take her suffer
It's so unfair
The things of the father
They've just fucked it all up (they've fucked it all up)
We had the best family
We had it all
All in our hands
He just pulled us through the wringer
Narcissistic
