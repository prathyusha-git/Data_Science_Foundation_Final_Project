I'm fine, the world can wait a little while
And I'll remember its face
So kind for giving me the privilege to say
Whatever happens next is up to me
Drop everything, come back to me
(Float in ecstasy, with you next to me now)
When you play for the long run, you play for the team
(We're all coming home)
I'm fine, and I can handle myself
The world's an addict with a vice up on the shelf
Glaring down and barely out of reach
Drop everything, come back to me
(Float in ecstasy, with you next to me now)
When you play for the long run, you play for the team
(We're all coming home)
When you talk among friends
You'd kill for a reason to be somewhere else, anywhere
I didn't mind, you weren't there
You were just out of reach
♪
I won't lie, I wore your name for awhile
'Til it started to burn in my head
Well you once said, if home was a place
You'd do all that you could not to stay
Drop everything, come back to me
(Float in ecstasy, with you next to me now)
When you play for the long run, you play for the team
(Float in ecstacy)
(Float in ecstasy)
