It's a fake hand
♪
Reaching through the gone
♪
And you're a cloud now
♪
But there's something on your mind
Hunting wild
♪
Gonna feed the ghost
♪
Haunting wild
Want to feel it in your bones
♪
Just take this chocolate and mint
All day in bed
With a bird nest in your mouth
Float through the dim
Without the strength to move
Hunting wild
Gonna feed the ghost
♪
Haunting wild
Want to feel it in your bones
Just close your eyes
Can't get the taste to fade
Haunting wild
Want to feel it in your bones
