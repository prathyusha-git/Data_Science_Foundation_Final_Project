Oh, my god, I'm sorry
We've had some before thee
And you may break my body
Broken baby bird bones
And the smell of being alone adorn the vanishing throne
Oh no
I'm never going to speak again
♪
Oh no
I'm never going to speak again
♪
Endure the fire flakes
And burn down the garden of Eden
Give up on everyone
'Cause nobody's there when you need them
Nobody's there when you need them
