I'm In New York like I'm Peter Parker
Wrote a sixteen then I tossed it
If I wanted bullshit, I'd just read Gawker (facts nigga)
Young Rick murder, I just shoot walkers
I'm a slave to this rap shit, I can't quit (nah)
Fresh cig with the grip (ooh)
A yuppie pop shit, call the gun Britney Jean
When the spears come out, I hit you and JT
You yuppies ain't real
Let you live for a fee
We taking Brooklyn back, you can leave the coffee
And you coons dying too
Word to Charles Barkley (word)
My head dreaded up like my name Marley
We don't do- shh
Simple rhyming ass niggas get they wig pushed back (uh)
Get your mic snatched, nicotine patched
Call my white boys up, get your life hacked
Heard your stock dropped, nigga this the blow back
Put the Hawkeyes on him, heard he like M*A*S*H (sheesh)
You gon' rust in peace, heard you like thrash
Put a price on your head, that's a light bag
.45 on me like Mike back, whoa

Baby I'm just heating up (it's lit)
Not a need, it is a must (yeah)
Feeling stuck, you know how to keep me up (yeah, yeah)
Icy love
Icy like a hockey puck (oh, alright)
Baby I'm just heating up (it's nasty, it's lit)
Need your love
You know how to keep me up (yeah, yeah)
Icy

These days ain't the same (Hidden Hills)
Y'all ain't built like that (deep off in the main)
These fuck niggas ain't - like that
Y'all niggas, y'all built like rats, oh
