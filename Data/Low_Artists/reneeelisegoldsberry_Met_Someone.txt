Together every moment
Trying to make a dream come true
I said, I want everything
You said, I want you
One step from forever
Just about to cross that line
You said, it only gets better
I said, I need time
I need time
I said, I need time
I left in search of an answer
I prayed to God it would come
And he rushed in like the water flood in the sky like the sun
So I drove home to tell you
Rehearsed the words on the way
But had to fight for the breath to say
I met someone
I met somebody new
I know it kills to hear
It kills to say it too
I met someone
It's not what I meant to do
I never thought I'd be, the one that hurt you
I met someone
I met someone
♪
Don't remember leaving
Don know how I got back to my place
But I recall the mirror cause I didn't recognize my face
They call it friendly fire, when you hit someone who's on your side
In every resurrection, something dies
I met someone
I met somebody new
I know it kills to hear
It kills to say it too
I met someone
It's not what I meant to do
I never thought I'd be, the one that hurt you
I met someone
I met someone
I met someone
♪
And I was so far apart
But love's in my life and yours
Cause she walked in through your window
And I was closing the door
We found forever when we, got out of each other's way
The truth may hurt but it saves the day
I met someone
I met somebody new
I know it kills to hear
It kills to say it too
I met someone
It's not what I'm meant to do
I never thought I'd be, the one to hurt you
I met someone
I met somebody new
I know it kills to hear
It kills to say it too
I met someone
It's not what I'm meant to do
I never thought I'd be, the one to hurt you
I met someone
I met someone
