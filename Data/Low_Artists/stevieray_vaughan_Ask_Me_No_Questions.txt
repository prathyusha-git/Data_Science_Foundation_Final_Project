You go out when you get ready
You come home when you please
You don't ever wanna love me
You think it outta be alright with me
When I try to talk to you, woman
And let you know just how I feel
All you tell me if I don't like it
There's someone else out there will
Oh, I done got wise to you, woman
You're not the only bird that flies in the sky
Or if you don't ask me no questions, darling
You know I, I won't tell you no lie
Because I like love your arms to be 'round me
And your lip to be close to mine
Oh, I want to love you, woman
And be with you all the time
Go ahead
Come on, yes
Come on

I'm comin', yeah
