I know what you told me
You migrated from my head
And it's true what you told me
That'd i'd find someone else instead
But I'd rather be with you
I'd rather be with you
I was scared 'cause you listened
And I understood the things I said
I'm scared of comitment
But now this girl is in my bed
I'd rather be with you
I'd rather be with you
I dont know if love exists
Someday if I want your kiss...
But i'd rather with you
They say that you dont know
What youve got until it's gone
Someone get this stranger out my bed
It's about time to say im wrong
'Cause I'd rather be with with you
I'd rather be with with you
I'd rather be with with you
I dont know if love exists
Someday if I want your kiss...
But i'd rather be with you
No one knows what life will hold
I'm not sayin we'll grown old...
But i'd rather be with you
And no, I won't promise you the Earth
Probably make mistakes and we'll both get hurt
But being without you is worse
'Cause now I understand is how this works
You're the one I want for whatever it's worth
I'd rather be with you
I dont know if love exists
Someday if I want you kiss...
But i'd rather be with you
No one knows what life will hold
I'm not saying we'll grow old
But I'd rather be with you
