I don't know, man
I think I'm starting to feel something peculiar
Something that's either aggression or it's got all possession of my mind
I'm so weak
I'm starting over won't you pull it back together for me
Nobody's ever gonna show me what I'm looking for
And I'm never gonna feel that fire again
He's gonna come around any one of these days and we'll just stay here in the meantime
My one bad habit was to watch you sad and feel a little bit at home
Play it faster, there's company to keep
A little louder just to tear a hole in me
I admire the desire that comes out of your mouth
You're always saying that you've got it all figured out
Nobody's ever gonna show me what I'm looking for
And I'm never gonna feel that fire again
He's gonna come around any one of these days and we'll just stay here in the meantime
My one bad habit was to watch you sad and feel a little bit at home
He's gonna come around any one of these days and we'll just wait here in the meantime
It never happened and it never will, go on and show me the way home
Poison stays it's goal without you (get it while you can)
Poison needs no help from you
Wish me over the edge this time
Let me fall, I'm already chasing you
He's gonna come around any one of these days and we'll just stay here in the meantime
My one bad habit was to watch you sad and feel a little bit at home
He's gonna come around any one of these days and we'll just wait here in the meantime
It never happened and it never will
Wasting all my time on everybody else
You know I don't mind
Wasting all my time, I know I'll get it back
