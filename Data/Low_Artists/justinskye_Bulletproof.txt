Them, want me, but you (You), know me
You're my no place like home (Home)
You're the type to take control, I know (I know)
So me lay up on your bed (Ay, ay, ay)
All rachet for my baby (Ay, ay, ay)
You don't rest until we
But we're bulletproof, no army
Bitches runnin' 'round sayin' they gon' make time
For you, I know I could do time
You ain't gotta hold tight on my waistline
You, you, the only one on my mind
All my friends and my mama bang both sign
You, you be shinin' like a green light
You gon' miss the sun starin' at the sky
We ain't gotta love like everyone else
We ain't gotta love like everyone else
'Cause we know we bulletproof
And don't need to make excuses
We ain't gotta love like everyone else
We ain't gotta love like them
We ain't gotta tell the world
What we're doing now, why, why, why, why, why
Keep it away from these birds
All they do is tweet, tweet, they ain't coming offline
I ain't gotta do the most to show that you my bae
We already know the deal, we ain't gotta overkill, no, no
Bitches runnin' 'round sayin' they gon' make time
For you, I know I could do time
You ain't gotta hold tight on my waistline
You, you, the only one on my mind
All my friends and my mama bang both sign
You, you be shinin' like a green light
You gon' miss the sun starin' at the sky
We ain't gotta love like everyone else
We ain't gotta love like everyone else
'Cause we know we bulletproof, and
Don't need to make excuses
We ain't gotta love like everyone else
We ain't gotta love like them
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
(We ain't gotta love like them)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Bitches runnin' 'round sayin' they gon' make time
For you, I know I could do time
You ain't gotta hold tight on my waistline
You, you, the only one on my mind
All my friends and my mama bang both sign
You, you be shinin' like a green light
You gon' miss the sun starin' at the sky
We ain't gotta love like everyone else
We ain't gotta love like everyone else (We ain't gotta love)
'Cause we know we bulletproof
And don't need to make excuses
We ain't gotta love like everyone else (No, no)
We ain't gotta love like them
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
(We ain't gotta love like them)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (We ain't gotta love like them, no, oh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Yeah-ah, we ain't gotta love like them)
