When I call you in the daylight, it's wasted
The problem is faulty, I fight that
I'm not about the basic, the same shit
I want something unique and different (different)
All eyes on me
And if I'm messing up your evening, you know how it's meant to be
Not that easy, the fake deal
I want something truthful and so real
I know you're not good for me
But I can never find a man to handle me
And I know it's not sanity
But would you lie with me?
And make feel like
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Don't call me Venus
(You should be my weakness) but you're my weakness
Yeah, you
(Yeah) I say we're magnets, how do we attract this?
Come a little closer, tell me you ain't on my planet
I know you're feelin' it, so calm it with your gibberish
And can you just consider it, that maybe there is more to this?
I know you're not good for me (good for me)
But I can never find a man to handle me (handle me)
And I know it's not sanity (sanity)
But would you lie with me
And make feel like
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Don't call me Venus
You should be my weakness (but you're my weakness)
Yeah, you
And it's coming 'round again, sounds are echoing
And it pulls me back again, I feel myself falling in
Whoa, whoa
Feel myself falling in
Whoa, whoa
Myself falling
Good for me
Good for me
Sanity
Whoa, whoa
Whoa (you make me feel it, you make me feel it)
Whoa, whoa
Whoa (you make me feel it, you make me feel it)
Whoa, whoa
Whoa
Don't call me Venus
Whoa, whoa
Whoa (you make me feel it, you make me feel it)
