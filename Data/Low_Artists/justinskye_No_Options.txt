I'ma say what I want to 'cause I got to
Your favorite thing to do was cut me off but I stopped you
And you think I'm dumb but your day gon' come
Now face me, don't run
For you this shit fun
Settle down now, little amount, shakin' tables
I won't wild out like a child now but I'm able
Eyes wide like a fiend, makin' a scene
Now you're friends gonna see what I mean
You got me sick, you're so toxic
Our love blew up, catastropic
I feel like we have no options
Want something real but it's not this

I finally said something
But I owe you nothing
Don't know why you are lonely
You gon' end up lonely
I won't battle with your ego or your fuckin' past, boy no, no
(Past, boy no, no)
Know you had it good but I'll probably your last, boy, yeah, yeah
'Cause this shit ain't love
I'm not what you want, I know I'm not home
You hate when I'm gone, oh
Settle down now, little amount, shakin' tables (yeah, yeah)
I won't wild out like a child now but I'm able (yeah)

(Hmm)
Suddenly I can hear myself
(Hmm-oh)
How did I end up here?
(Hmm)
Late night I feel like my mind gets cloudy
And I, know
I know that I've tried and you just ignored my effort
And I swear (ooh)
There's no more time wastin', treat me like I'm crazy, it's you, woah
