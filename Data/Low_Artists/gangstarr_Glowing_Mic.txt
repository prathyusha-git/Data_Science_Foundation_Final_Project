I destroy the mic for my glow
You know, you, you know
You know it's backwards to go against God, dawg
I destroy the mic for my glow
You know, you-
You know it's backwards to go against God, dawg
That explains how we rock
Mister Gang Starr, I make it do what it do
So true, classic like the Fu Manchu
Now, you cowards see I'm holdin' the title
Married to the game, son, you know that I'm vital
Your shit's weak, you ain't true to this
I'm the embodiment of real, I paid my dues in this
Mister Gang Starr, a hip-hop phenom
The bomb, these misfits just don't belong
Off-top, I go for the head pop
You got your chest protected so you still get dropped
Bedrock, just like Barney and Fred
Mister Gang Starr, comin' with a army of heads
Your charm is now dеad, they tired of you
Not any of 'em gonna ask what you wеre tryna do
I'm fryin' a few domes, just like I do catfish
Got 'em doin' backflips, this ain't gymnastics
This drastic for foes, I got 'em walkin' on tippy toes
Ballerina style, you don't wanna see the ninas, child
Meanwhile, Mister Gang Starr relates
Not commercial, yet still I'm one of the greats
Controversial like your favorite emcee debates
I'm classic like a break comin' straight out the crate
Fresh out the gate again, time to fill my plate again
It's Mister Gang to the Starr, I'm the latest trend
Mister Gang Starr, I make it do what it do
So true, classic like the Fu Manchu
Now, you cowards see I'm holdin' the title
Married to the game, son, you know that I'm vital
Your shit's weak, you ain't true to this
I'm the embodiment of real, I paid my dues in this
Mister Gang Starr, a hip-hop phenom
The bomb, these misfits just don't belong
Who's a legendary character? Harder than the floor
Similar to nothin' you ever saw
Historically consistent, methodically persistent
Categorically gifted for sure
Never down for the count, might fool you with the rope-a-dope
Work by combinations, crack your shell, spill your yolk
Witness my third evolution
Close your eyes if you're afraid to see these herbs execution
Wanna-bes, I annihilate, obliterate, terminate
Treat 'em like batter, watch these short cakes bake
Mister Gang Starr, the one and only, only one
Niggas are gassed, soon, they'll be the lonely ones
You know me son, I bring the fire like a blowtorch
So don't step too close or you'll end up gettin' most scorched
Just like a charcoal briquette
So pay homage, we ain't even make it hard for you yet
Mister Gang Starr, I make it do what it do
So true, classic like the Fu Manchu
Now, you cowards see I'm holdin' the title
Married to the game, son, you know that I'm vital
Your shit's weak, you ain't true to this
I'm the embodiment of real, I paid my dues in this
Mister Gang Starr, a hip-hop phenom
The bomb, these misfits just don't belong
That, that, that, that
That, that, that, that explains how we rock
That, that, that, that
That, that, that, that explains how we rock
