I'm destined for better things
And I'm trying to better me
I've been finding better days
But I'm finding everything changes (Changes, changes, changes)
Everything changes
Yeah, it's summertime in CT, around a quarter to nine
The music loud, the windows down, passed Nevers Road while I drive
Gambino bumpin' through the system, those were simpler times
When things were perfectly imperfect and my music wasn't easy to find
Back when I still could call my dad one more time
Back when I still could call my
Grandpa 'til dementia started takin' his mind
So many times I took for granted our time
To say I was a perfect son or grandson, to keep it real, I'd be lyin'
I wanna try to be better, I wanna give more than I take
I miss our moments together, I'll try to learn from my mistakes
Until I'm better than ever, I'll try to turn my pain to paint
Is this a song or a letter? Because the two just feel the same
I saw my ex is now engaged since yesterday and I smiled
I hope you finally found the love you were searchin' for for a while
Hope they take an inch and give you a mile
If everything that went wrong had went
Right, might be a whole different aisle
Think I'm too busy postin' pictures of our sold-out shows
That I forgot about the people and the love back home
The ones who'd champion for Mark when Witt was much less known
And now I barely even answer my phone, damn
I'm destined for better things
And I'm trying to better me
I've been finding better days
But I'm finding everything changes (Changes, changes, changes)
Everything changes
Yeah, it's wintertime in Amsterdam, TEAMWITT is waiting outside
Songs recorded in my closet, now they wanna see live
Dan comes inside, I say,
"Can you believe we're here or that there's even a line?"
He laughs and says, "Of course,
Imagine us workin' a nine-to-five," that's no lie
Whilst your degree will put you deeper in debt
Your student loan just seems to grow and now it's more than your check
How can you plan to see the world if you're just stuck at a desk?
How can you calculate success by the results on a test? I digress
Sometimes I have to just admit I'm a mess
Don't try to try harder for someone who's not tryin' their best
You used to say I was a no one and now you're the first to text
No longer holdin' on the grudges, forgive but I don't forget
Can't change the people around you, so change the people around you
Hold on to those who care and let go of the ones that doubt you
It's crazy what can change, navigate in this world without you
I just hope when you look down you're proud, too
I'm destined for better things
And I'm trying to better me
I've been finding better days
But I'm finding everything
