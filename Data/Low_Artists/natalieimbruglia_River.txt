I see you in my dreams
Your face is haunting me
We are way off the map
But always find our way back
This freedom drives me wild
But I'm a prisoner of your smile
So far away but so close
I hold you tight and let go
You're the one, the one for me
That I don't want but I need
And like the river meets the sea
When you run, run to me
River, river flow
River, river run
River, river go
River, river come
River, river flow
River, river run
River, river go
River, come
We're walking on razor's edge
In your daydreams and in my bed
Always swimming up tide
Such a heavenly high
You're the one, the one for me
That I don't want but I need
And like the river meets the sea
When you run, run to me
River, river flow
River, river run
River, river go
River, river come
River, river flow
River, river run
River, river go
River, come
It's heavy, it's heady
This is heavy, let go and come to me
This is heavy, it's heady
This is heavy, come to me
You're the one, the one for me
That I don't want but I need
And like the river meets the sea
When you run, run to me
River, river flow
River, river run
River, river go
River, river come
River, river flow
River, river run
River, river go
River, come
You're the one, the one for me
That I don't want but I need
And like the river meets the sea
When you run, run to me
River, river flow
River, river run
River, river go
River, river come
River, river flow
River, river run
River, river go
River, come
