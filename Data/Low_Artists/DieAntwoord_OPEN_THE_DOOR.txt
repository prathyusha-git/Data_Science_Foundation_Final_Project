What am I? What am I? What am I?
What am I? What am I?
I am the one who shot open the gate to the overseas
I am the plug I am the thug
I am the royal blood the people love 'cause I fuck it up
This is my house
Living that imperial lifestyle
Surrounded by cameras and night-owls
Slid him 23 milli and its mine now
I am a gentleman
A highly decorated war veteran
Educated and eloquent
For a better brighter future Ninja for President

The track got you feeling all warm and fuzzy 'cause I blessed it
With all my love and affection
Every time I bust it
They say you fuckin crushed it
I am the softest
But I still jump on the mic and spark a fuckin mosh-pit
We represent The House Of Zef
Rock fuck you haters chains around our necks
Every time we spit it sound so fresh
You keep hearing our voices inside your head
What am I? What am I? What am I?

I am the one who finks u freeky and I like you a lot
I am a trip I have a gift I am the fuckin shit up in this bitch
Yip is fukn lit
