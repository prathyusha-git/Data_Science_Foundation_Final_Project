I just wanna be, yeah, favorite
Oh, oh
I know this could be a little unusual
So I'ma tell you what you didn't know
You give me everything I'm crazy for
Every single time, that you be the DJ (oh)
Play me somethin' from the streets
Both bodies callin' out, two part harmonies
I'ma let you take the lead (the lead)
Like your magic on repeat, 'peat
I just wanna be your favorite (I just wanna be your favorite)
Meet you drunk and blow on these purple vapors
I can tell you want me naked (I can see you want me)
Ooh, you know we're on the same wavelength
I just wanna be your favorite (I just wanna be your favorite)
Meet you drunk and blow on these purple vapors
I can tell you want me naked (I can see you want me)
Ooh, you know we're on the same wavelength
I just (I just) wanna be your favorite baby

You know I'm not your average or typical
Yeah, I'm the type of girl that you should know
I'ma give you everything you crazy for
Every single time, that you be the DJ (oh)
Give me somethin' from the streets
Both bodies callin' out, two part harmonies
