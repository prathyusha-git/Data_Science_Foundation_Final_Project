I wanna be your man
I wanna be your man
Hey, lady, let me tell you why
I can't live my life without you, oh baby
Every time I see you walking by, I get a thrill
You don't notice me, but in time you will
I must make you understand
I wanna be your man (I wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man (yes, I do, yeah-yeah)
I wanna be your man (I wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man, I wanna be your man
Better not pass me by, 'cause if you do you'll lose a good
Thing (oh, baby)
'Cause what I've got to say (sealed with a kiss)
And a wedding ring (wedding ring)
My mind is blind at times, I can't see anyone but you
Those other girls don't matter, no, they can't spoil my view
I must make you understand
I wanna be your man (I wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man (yes, I do, yeah-yeah)
I wanna be your man (I wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man, I wanna be your man
Words can never say what I feel (it's too intense)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried to tell you how I feel)
But I get mixed up (so mixed up)
My mind is blind at times, I can't see anyone but you
Those other girls don't matter, no, they can't spoil my view
Mark, must make you understand
I wanna be your man (I wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man (yes, I do, yeah-yeah)
I wanna be your man (I wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man, I wanna be your man
I wanna be your man (I wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man (yes, I do, yeah-yeah)
I wanna be your man (I wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man, I wanna be your man
