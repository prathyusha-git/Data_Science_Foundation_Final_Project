Have you got
The shake up and out?
Rock and roll
Clouds roll
By outside
Watch out for the pain inside your smile
Makes me feel
Bleeding lights, colours colliding
Lovely blur
Patience
Haunt my sleep
Sweep up the heart on the heart attack
Dipped in silver
Oh, secret crush, push me inside
Shoot to kill
Telephone lines connect
Connect a call
