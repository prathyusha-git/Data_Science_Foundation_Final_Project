What is this feeling, confusing me more and more?
I'm out of control, my body is also unsure
Don't understand what's happened to me
This is not how it should be
Everyday the work is harder to face
For these loving arms has no better place
Emotions, running away with me
Changing me endlessly, effecting my gravity
Emotions, taking me up and down
Turning my life forever, stealing my energy
[Incomprehensible] effect my gravity
Got your energy, check, check endlessly
I searched for solutions, no hope for conclusions, I'm torn
What's this life all about, I can't work out why I was born?
Don't know what is this thought, it's the power of thought in me
It's a strange big action but I never felt this way before
It seems to have a life of its own, it goes on and on, and on
Emotions, running away with me
Changing me endlessly, effecting my gravity
Emotions, taking me up and down
Turning my life forever, stealing my energy
It's a strange big action but I never felt this way before
It seems to have a life of its own, it goes on and on, and on
Emotions, running away with me
Changing me endlessly, effecting my gravity
Emotions, taking me up and down
Turning my life forever, stealing my energy
[Incomprehensible] effect my gravity
Got your energy, check, check endlessly
Emotions, running away with me
Changing me endlessly, effecting my gravity
Emotions, taking me up and down
Turning my life forever, stealing my energy
