I'll be an anchor
But I won't bring you down
Somehow
My love is easy
Like breathing anything
♪
Stay with me
I know you're exhausted
I'll be what you want, now
What was it you wanted?
My love is easy
Like breathing anything
Try to look cute when I'm frozen from fear
I die inside
And smile from ear to ear
Then hope that you
Will notice me here
All you have to do is call me
Every day without you's so
Lonely
My love is easy
Like breathing anything
