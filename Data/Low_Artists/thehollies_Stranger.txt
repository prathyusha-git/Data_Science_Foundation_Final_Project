Down down down town, east side of the river
Bowery boys are living off the street
There stands a stranger all dressed in black
He's looking for someone - he's gonna knife 'em in the back
Hit man, G-man, con man, watch it man, he might be from the CIA
Sneaky Pete's using his feet, getting off the street 'cos
He's got something to hide
Danger, there's a stranger
Intruding in your own backyard
But stranger, there's a danger
Don't come across nobody hard
So tough mixing it rough down in Harlem
There's no honky boys for miles around
But there's that stranger all dressed in white
He's looking for someone
He's gonna show 'em the light, yeah
He's gonna show 'em the light, oh yeah
Don't feel safe using the face of Fifth Avenue
Pin stripe suits ain't no disguise if you're not a man that's true
Hit man, G-man, con man, watch it man, he might be from the CIA
Sneaky Pete's using his feet, getting off the street 'cos
He's got something to hide
Danger, there's a stranger
Intruding in your own backyard
But stranger, there's a danger
Don't come across nobody hard
