I have lost my way
Yet I'm here to say
I'm holding on
In my darkest hour
You're still reaching out
But the feeling's gone
I'm guilty to be human
Cause I just keep on losing
Myself in all the music
And I know I tried my best to be heard
Maybe these are my last words
Now you might've guessed
The reasons why I've left
But I just can't explain
Why I'm hurting you
Oh, I'm hurting too
I'm just not the same
I'm guilty to be human
Cause I just keep on losing
Myself in all the music
And I know I tried my best to be heard
Maybe these are my last words
Oh, I'm only human
I don't know what I'm doing
I'm guilty to be human
Cause I just keep on losing
Myself in all the music
And I know I tried my best to be heard
Baby, these are my last word
(Whoa Ooo Ooo)
