This year
We left our problems overground
And bought a house with no windows because who needs
those when theres only dirt around (only dirt around)
This year
We put feelings in our mouths (mouths)
And built a wall around the garden,
10 miles high to keep the neighbors out Gotta keep the neighbors out
Gotta keep the neighbors out
Gotta keep the neighbors out
Gotta keep the neighbors out
This room
Is the only thing we trust
Because the TV says that what's out there
is still too dangerous (it's too dangerous)
This room
Is our words and prairie now (now)
And though we've had to sacrifice open skies just to
keep the neighbors out (we gotta keep the neighbors out)
Gotta keep the neighbors out
Gotta keep the neighbors out
Gotta keep the neighbors out
Hey
Can you hear the screams at night
Echoed on the water rise
Comin' from the other side (comin' from the other side)
Can you hear the screams at night
Echoed on the water rise
Comin' from the other side (comin' from the other side)
Gotta keep the neighbors out (yeah)
Gotta keep the neighbors out
