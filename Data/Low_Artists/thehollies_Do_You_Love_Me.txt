You didn't want me around

Well, do you love me? (I'm in the groove)
Well, do love me? (Do you love me?)
Now that I can dance? (Dance, dance)
Watch me now (Push, push)
Ah, shake it up, baby (Push, push)
Why, you're drivin' me crazy (Push, push)
Oh, come on a little closer
Well, I can mash potato (I can mash potato)
Well, I can do the twist (And I can do the twist)
