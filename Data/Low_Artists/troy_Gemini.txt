I got a fever
Ooo you're my medication
Whenever I'm near you
I feel like I can breathe
Oh, when my mind's on the move
You tell me to be patient
(Tell me to be patient)
Mmm the moment I hear you
Baby I believe
That I could never love somebody
Need somebody
Want somebody more
Than I want you
Than I want you
Than I want you
Baby take me to the other side
Gemini
(Oh you know she's my)
(Oh you know she's my)
You don't need nobody
Ooo little miss independent
But then you come my way
Looking for some company
Ohhhh
I'm a sucker for you
Can't turn you away
You'd think that I'd get tired of you
Keeping me awake
But something 'bout you baby
Gets me every time
Ooo I'm taking it as a sign
I could never love somebody
Need somebody
Want somebody more
Than I want you
Than I want you
Than I want you
Baby take me to the other side
Gemini
(Oh you know she's my)
(Oh you know she's my)
G-G-Gema
G-G-G-G-G-Gemini
G-G-Gema
G-G-G-G-G-Gemini
Don't you know
Don't you know she's my
Don't you know
Don't you know she's my
Don't you know
Don't you know she's my
Don't you know
Don't you know she's my
(Oh you know she's my)
Oh know that you're my
Gemini
(Oh you know she's my)
Oh baby don't you know
(Oh you know she's my)
G-G-G-Gemini
(Oh you know she's my)
Baby Gemini
