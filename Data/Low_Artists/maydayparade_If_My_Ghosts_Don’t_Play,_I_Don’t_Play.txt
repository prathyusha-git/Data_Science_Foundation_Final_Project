We've been running for so long
Is there a place where we belong?
We paint the town in shades of gray, and call it home
Always standing on the out
Just a shadow in the crowd
We found escape outside the sound of it all
♪
There's a feeling I can't shake
Like something standing in the way
And I can't seem to keep it straight anymore
God, so this is all that's left of me
A ghost that's cursed to never leave
I feel so lost and out of reach from everyone
Hold your head up high
And you will never be alone
We will walk this world together
Just take my hand, and
We will march as one
And we don't need a reason
No longer in the shadows
We will never walk alone
♪
And I know you've felt the same
Like there's a fire in our veins
We've been standing in the flame, burning bright
Yeah, and they say we might be damned
But they will never understand
So come on and take my hand, and I will lead
Hold your head up high
And you will never be alone
We will walk this world together
Just take my hand, and
We will march as one
And we don't need a reason
No longer in the shadows
We will never walk alone
We will never walk alone
We've been running for so long
Hold your head up high
And you will never be alone
We will walk this world together
Just take my hand, and
We will march alone
And we don't need a reason
No longer in the shadows
And we will never walk alone
Hey, broken heart
I can show you how it starts to get better
When we come together
And we will never walk alone
Under heavy eyes
Every word we will all sing together
Keep marching forever
And we will never walk alone
I can show you how it starts to get better
Keep marching forever
