This is our breakup song
We've been writing it for, oh, so long
Another night, stayed up until dawn
Tracing the anxious lines of your palm
I tried to write something nice
The words were forced, they just collide
No need for tears or to cry
Let's not pretend that we tried
I'll take the blame for this one
The credit all for a song with no name
I wish it were a happier one
But every note we sang seemed to come out wrong
Shattered against the wall
Leaving the one thing we agree on
I tried to write something nice
The words were forced, they just collide
No need for tears or to cry
Let's not pretend that we tried
I'll take the blame for this one

This is our breakup song
We've been writing it for, oh, so long
We said we'd still be friends
But it's hard to make a start from an end
I tried to write something nice
The words were forced, they just collide
No need for tears or to cry
Let's not pretend that we tried
I'll take the blame for this one
