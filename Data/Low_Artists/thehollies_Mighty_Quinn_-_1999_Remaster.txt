Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn
Everybody's building ships and boats
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy
but when Quinn the Eskimo gets here
everybody's gonna jump for joy
I like to go just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet
But jumping queues and making haste
just ain't my cup of meat
Everyone's beneath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb
but when Quinn the Eskimo gets here
all the pigeons gonna run to him
Let me do what I want to do, I can't decide 'em all
Just tell me where to put 'em, and I'll tell you who call
Nobody can get no sleep, there's someone on everyone's toes
but when Quinn the Eskimo gets here
everybody's gonna want to doze
